Employment	Employment - Jobs in Europe	"With millions unemployed, the poor state of the labour market is having a very serious impact on living and working conditions in Europe. Policies to address the jobs crisis by creating new jobs and safeguarding existing ones are a very high priority for the EU and for national governments. Employment - Jobs in Europe addresses employment policy - the changing nature of work in Europe, job creation, restructuring in organisations and labour market trends."	http://eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/jobsineuropeupdate.jpg
Youth	Youth in Europe	"Young people have been hit particularly hard by the crisis. Across Europe millions of them are effectively disengaged - not in employment, education or training. As well as the severe impact on these young people and their families, there is an enormous social and economic cost to this disengagement. Youth in Europe covers economic and social issues affecting young people - education and training, unemployment, social inclusion, labour market integration, health problems, quality of life, mobility and migration."	http://eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/youthineuropeupdate.jpg
Quality of life	Quality of life, citizens and public services	"Many Europeans have experienced a worsening of their standard of living in recent years. How have housing, education, health and care services been affected in terms of access, affordability and quality? How can public services be reformed to deal with new needs and reduced budgets? Quality of life, citizens and public services deals with the challenge of improving life quality and services for Europe's citizens - standards of living, public service quality and accessibility and social cohesion in the face of economic and social disparities."	http://eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/qualityoflifeupdate.jpg
