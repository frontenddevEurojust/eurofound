European Quality of Life Surveys (EQLS)	EQLS	"<p>Carried out every four years, this unique, pan-European survey examines both the objective circumstances of European citizens' lives and how they feel about those circumstances and their lives in general. It looks at a range of issues, such as employment, income, education, housing, family, health and work-life balance. It also looks at subjective topics, such as people's levels of happiness, how satisfied they are with their lives, and how they perceive the quality of their societies.</p>
<p>By running the survey regularly, it has also become possible to track key trends in the quality of people's lives over time. Previous surveys have shown, for instance, that people are having greater difficulty making ends meet since the economic crisis began. In many countries, they also feel that there is now more tension between people from different ethnic groups. And across Europe, people now trust their governments less than they did before. However, people still continue to get the greatest satisfaction from their family life and personal relationships.</p>
<p>Over the years, the EQLS has developed into a valuable set of indicators which complements traditional indicators of economic growth and living standard such as GDP or income. The EQLS indicators are as clear and appealing as GDP, however they are more inclusive of environmental and social aspects of progress and therefore are easily integrated into the decision-making process and taken up by public debate at EU and national levels in the European Union.</p>
<p>In each wave a sample of adult population has been selected randomly for a face to face interview. In view of the prospective European enlargements and interest from the EFTA countries the geographical coverage of the survey has expanded over time:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/2003/index.htm">First EQLS in 2003</a> - 28 countries: 27 EU Member States and Turkey</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/2007/index.htm">Second EQLS in 2007-2008</a> - 31 countries: 27 EU Member States, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Turkey and Norway</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/2011/index.htm">Third EQLS in 2011-2012</a> - 34 countries: 27 EU Member States and Croatia, Iceland, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkey and Kosovo.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a number of questions from the second EQLS were asked as part of a Eurobarometer survey in 2009 which allowed for the study of <a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1047.htm">Trends in quality of life in the EU: 2003-2009</a>.</p>
<p>Data from EQLS and other complementary sources also feed the Eurofound’s electronic database of statistical quality of life indicators (<a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eurlife/index.php">EurLIFE</a>).</p>"	"<p>The <a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/index.htm">European Quality of Life Survey (<acronym id="EQLS" title="European Quality of Life Survey" lang="en">EQLS</acronym>)</a>, implemented in 2003, 2007 and 2011-12, provides a comprehensive portrait of living conditions in European countries. It contains a broad range of indicators on different dimensions of quality of life, both objective and subjective. In addition, some EQLS questions were used in a Special Eurobarometer on Poverty and Social Exclusion in autumn 2009 and 2010. Given the recent high level of interest in the quality of life of European citizens, the EQLS is increasingly important for Eurofound’s contribution to the political and academic debate.</p>"	"sites/all/_docs/feeds/uploads/eqls-survey.png"	0
European Company Surveys (ECS)	ECS	"<p>The European Company Survey (ECS) has been carried out every four years since its inception in 2004-2005 as the European Establishment Survey on Working Time and Work-Life Balance (ESWT). The second survey (performed under the new title European Company Survey) was completed in 2009 and the third survey in 2013.</p>
<p><span class="news">NEW</span> The <a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/ecs/2013/index.htm">first findings of the 2013 survey</a> are now online.</p>
<p>The survey has the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>map, assess and quantify information on company policies and practices across Europe on an harmonised basis;</li>
	<li>analyse relationships between company practices and their impact as well as looking at practices from the point of view of structures at company level, focusing in particular on social dialogue;</li>
	<li>monitor trends;</li>
	<li>contribute to the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm">European 2020 Strategy</a> through mapping and understanding company policies and practices which can have an impact on smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as the development of social dialogue in companies. The survey should allow for the development of homogeneous indicators on these issues for a European audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ECS is a questionnaire-based representative sample survey carried out by telephone in the language(s) of the country. A special feature of the survey is that interviews take place with the manager responsible for human resources in the establishment and when possible with an employee representative. The first wave of the survey covered issues around working time arrangements and work-life balance at company level. The second wave looked at different forms of flexibility, including working-time flexibility, contractual flexibility, variable pay and financial participation, as well as accompanying human resource measures, and the nature and quality of workplace social dialogue. The third survey will look at workplace organisation, workplace innovation, employee participation and social dialogue in European workplaces.</p>
<p>Following the EU enlargement, the geographical scope of the survey has expanded over time:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/ecs/2004/index.htm">First ECS (ESWT) in 2004-2005</a>: 21 countries: 15 ‘old’ EU Member States and Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Slovenia</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/ecs/2009/index.htm">Second ECS in 2009</a>: 30 countries including the 27 EU Member States, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Turkey</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/ecs/2013/index.htm">Third ECS in 2013</a>: 32 countries including 27 EU Member States and Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Iceland, Montenegro and Turkey</li>
</ul>"	"<p>The <a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/ecs/index.htm">European Company Survey (<acronym id="ECS" title="European Company Survey" lang="en">ECS</acronym>)</a>, implemented in 2004, 2009 and 2013, gives an overview of workplace practices and how they are negotiated in European establishments. It is based on the views of both managers and employee representatives. The survey was first launched in 2005 as the European Survey on Working Time and Work-Life Balance. It was repeated in 2009 as the European Company Survey, focussing on flexibility practices and the quality of social dialogue. The first findings from the 2013 survey are now online.</p>"	"sites/all/_docs/feeds/uploads/ecs-survey.jpg"	1
European Working Conditions Surveys (EWCS)	EWCS	"<p>Since its launch in 1990 the European Working Conditions Survey has provided an overview of working conditions in Europe in order to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Assess and quantify working conditions of both employees and the self employed across Europe on a harmonised basis</li>
	<li>Analyse relationships between different aspects of working conditions</li>
	<li>Identify groups at risk and issues of concern as well as of progress</li>
	<li>Monitor trends by providing homogeneous indicators on these issues</li>
	<li>Contribute to European policy development in particular on quality of work and employment issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scope of the survey questionnaire has widened substantially since the first edition, aiming to provide a comprehensive picture of the everyday reality of men and women&nbsp;at work. Gender mainstreaming has been an important concern for recent reviews of the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Themes covered today include employment status, working time duration and organisation, work organisation, learning and training, physical and psychosocial risk factors, health and safety, work-life balance, worker participation, earnings and financial security, as well as work and health.</p>
<p>In each wave a random sample of workers (employees and self-employed) has been interviewed face to face. Following the European enlargements and interest from the EFTA countries the geographical coverage of the survey has expanded:</p>
<ul>
	<li>First EWCS in 1990/1991: workers in the EC12 were surveyed</li>
	<li>Second EWCS in 1995/1996: workers in the EU15 were surveyed</li>
	<li>Third EWCS in 2000: the EU15 and Norway were surveyed in a first phase, with the survey being extended to cover the 12 'new' Member States in 2001, and Turkey in 2002 in a second phase</li>
	<li>Fourth EWCS in 2005: EU27, plus Norway, Croatia, Turkey and Switzerland</li>
	<li>Fifth EWCS in 2010: workers were surveyed in the EU27, Norway, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo.</li>
</ul>"	"<p>The <a href="http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/ewcs/index.htm">European Working Conditions Survey (<acronym id="EWCS" title="European Working Conditions Survey" lang="en">EWCS</acronym>)</a> is the longest running survey, and has become an established source of information about working conditions and the quality of work and employment. With five waves having been implemented since 1990, it enables monitoring of long-term trends in working conditions in Europe. Themes covered include employment status, working time arrangements, work organisation, learning and training, physical and psychosocial risk factors, health and safety, worker participation, work-life balance, earnings and financial security, as well as work and health.</p>"	"sites/all/_docs/feeds/uploads/ewcs-survey.png"	2
