Restructuring in SMEs in Europe	2011-2012	Restructuring is part and parcel of the economic fabric in Europe, as companies must adapt to altered conditions in a bid to remain sustainable and competitive. Small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) constitute over 99% of European businesses and about 66% of private sector employment.
The greening of industries in the EU	2011-2012	This project provides an overview of how companies anticipate and manage the effects of greening of industries on job quality, what the role of skills development is in this context and the contribution of governments in facilitating the overall development of a workforce for a green economy.
Workers with care responsibilities	2009-2010	This database highlights some 50 company initiatives that support workers with dependent-care responsibilities in 11 European Member States.
Tackling undeclared work in Europe	2007-2009 (100 cases in the EU27 and Norway), and 2012 (86 cases from Croatia and 4 EU candidate countries: Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey).	Undeclared work can be defined as work which is in itself legal but is not declared to the authorities for tax, social security and/or labour law purposes. It has long been a focus of attention for policymakers in Europe. Eurofound has addressed the topic with a series of research initiatives and, in 2012, updated this knowledge-base with a wide-ranging research project on undeclared work in the EU and certain neighbouring countries.
Attractive workplace for all company cases	2006-2007	These cases are examples of 'win-win situations', showing that it is possible to combine quality of work and employment with economic performance. They deal with key dimensions of the Lisbon strategy such as employability, increasing the labour market participation of underrepresented groups and people at risk of exclusion, pay, flexibility, and business creation and entrepreneurship.
Ageing workforce	2005-2007	The retention of older workers in employment is an important objective not only of labour market policies but also for social protection budgets. The Foundation has gathered and analysed cases of good practice in age management, designed to improve job opportunities and working conditions for older workers. Each case study describes how the organisation approached the issue and what the results were in the medium to long term.
