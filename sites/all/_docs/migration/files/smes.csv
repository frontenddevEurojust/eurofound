"AMSY Marking Technology, Hungary"~"AMSY Marking Technology "~"<p>When Hungarian company AMSY Marking Technology took over the national subsidiary (clients, projects, inventory and employees) of its main supplier (a global player), the merging of the two corporate cultures was among the main challenges of the restructuring.&nbsp; At the end of the first phase phase of restructuring in 2010, sales had improved by 40% and turnover was expected to stabilise or grow slightly. The family business had become a small corporation with goals, methodology, processes and motivated people.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>S&aacute;ndor Szőllősi founded AMSY Marking Technology Ltd. in 2000, taking four technicians and the right to distribute marking equipment from AMSY International, where he had been co-owner. The original right to this in Hungary had been acquired by the subsidiary of New England Machinery, an American packaging machine manufacturer, where Szőllősi worked between 1990&ndash;1992 as a consultant.</p>\r\n<p>AMSY (American Systems) provides coding and marking solutions for industrial companies. The product range consists of 30 kinds of equipment, including industrial small-character inkjet printers, print-and-apply labellers. Clients include medium-sized to multinational companies. The company has an exclusive contract to distribute products only in Hungary.</p>\r\n<p>Out of the 30-strong workforce, the AMSY sales division is composed of five technical engineers or economists, while the technical service is provided by 14 well-trained, experienced staff. There is no trade union or works council at the company.</p>\r\n<p>AMSY has been a family business since 2006, when S&aacute;ndor&rsquo;s son Gergely joined the company.</p>\r\n<p>Many Hungarian companies deal with identification technology but only five distribute small character inkjet printers that are sold worldwide. The market size during the past five years has been constant but AMSY could increase sales and capture one third of the market through new product development, for example, software to connect printing equipment to a company network, or by customising the serial marking, labelling machines from their original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners. Other possibilities include finding new items to distribute, such as digital label printers, or by investing in new businesses close to marking but not exactly equipment sales (such as contract marking, or equipment lease) or find supplementary marking equipment to sell through their East European distributor partners.</p>\r\n<p>The company increased revenues during 2000&ndash;2008, from HUF 168,000,000 (&euro; 582,761 as at 29 June, 2012) to almost HUF 1.5 billion (&euro; 5,203,220), despite occasional blips. Until 2005, the marking industry in Hungary experienced an annual growth in volume of 10%, despite the fact that there was also a sharp rise in the number of original equipment manufacturers and service providers &ndash; with growing employment numbers. The 2009 crisis hit the sector hard. AMSY turnover decreased by 20% but responded however, with a strong growth of 40% in 2010.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In 2003 AMSY acquired a site in the prestigious Buda&ouml;rs Industrial Park, near the capital Budapest, and commissioned a construction company to design a headquarters for them.</p>\r\n<p>However, the principle marking technology producers in the world were experiencing major changes. AMSY&rsquo;s main supplier became the biggest player, and took over its two main rivals, one of which had a subsidiary in Hungary. Suddenly the nominal non-exclusivity contract on distribution rights became real, as AMSY and the supplier&rsquo;s new subsidiary were selling the same product range. The supplier set out a plan for its new subsidiary and AMSY to cooperate, based on a model plan for the cooperation of two distributors, used in more than a hundred countries.The plan was practicable, but it was hard to meet all the stipulations, as it meant squeezing the turnover of both companies. There was also the knowledge that where this had happened elsewhere the two distributors had merged, with the subsidiary coming out on top. With this in mind, S&aacute;ndor Szőllősi had to decide whether to concentrate on selling only his supplier&rsquo;s products and begin building the headquarters, or try new business somewhere else. He opted to build the new HQ in 2005, and to deal with the subsidiary as best it could. The subsidiary, however, had a disastrous year in 2006, making sizeable losses. The directors of American supplier dismissed the subsidiary management and hired an Austrian crisis manager to direct the subsidiary&rsquo;s operations.</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the supplier decided that Hungary was too small for two such operations, and it offered AMSY the chance to take over the subsidiary, which AMSY accepted.</p>\r\n<p>AMSY agreed to pay off the subsidiary&rsquo;s debt up front, plus its business value (the equivalent of five years potential profit) in monthly instalments over three years. The agreement incorporated a sales incentive, which meant that if sales were well above target, the monthly payment was lowered. In the second year, AMSY&rsquo;s monthly instalment was reduced but the third year was very difficult. The worldwide crisis hit sales hard, the quota was not reached, and AMSY had to pay extra every month in 2009 &ndash; which proved an almost unbearable burden.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The merger started in summer 2007. AMSY took over all clients, projects, inventory and the ten remaining employees. The other employees joined a new company established by the dismissed management of the subsidiary, which has become a major competitor in Hungary.</p>\r\n<p>The merger was a sudden shock for AMSY, as new machines and work habits were introduced. The two companies were very different in culture, wages and workflows. The American company had implemented dozens of mergers throughout the world so they were aware of how difficult the process could be. The supplier who had known S&aacute;ndor Szőllősi since 1992, knew that he had majored in design engineering; had become an effective salesman, and was an excellent problem solver. However, although his management style had achieved good results, they were concerned that he might not necessarily be as effective in the new merged company. Consequently they sent a team to assess the situation and draw up an action plan. This called for the acquisition of SAP Business 1 software to record procedures and actions, and to handle purchases, deliveries and stores. The New Hungarian Development Plan &ndash; co-financed by EU funds &ndash; gave AMSY 25% of the total HUF 12 million (&euro;41,625) cost for the SAP implementation. The software changed everything. It enabled performance evaluation and monthly publication of results. It improved transparency and consequently &ndash;more important &ndash; employee trust.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to the merger, AMSY had 16 employees. S&aacute;ndor Szőllősi&rsquo;s son Gergely reorganised its structure in 2007, in order to take on the 10 new employees from the subsidiary, and hire four new employees.</p>\r\n<p>The merger contract, signed in summer 2007, put together two previously competing teams. There were two people available for each job, which led to redundancies at every level. However, AMSY wanted to retain as many employees as possible from the subsidiary which entailed redeployment to new positions. The subsidiary had a more formal management culture, while AMSY relied on the originality, enthusiasm and extraordinary efforts of their employees. The challenge was to make a new, a more effective organisation, which led to growing interest and support from the supplier which has been sending experts for consultations and helping to decide necessary actions and their implementation. These include improving the identification of new market opportunities, providing additional sales support and to communicating changes to the rest of the market.</p>\r\n<p>Up to 2007, the company had only yearly distributor contracts with the supplier, which could be terminated without explanation. To complete the merger, a three-year contract was signed with new terms. When this contract expired, the supplier proposed a new one-year contract, but eventually agreed to sign a three-year one on condition AMSY came up with a three-year business plan which they would approve. AMSY overcame this challenge setting new goals, new responsibilities, and new deadlines for each department in the company.</p>\r\n<p>During restructuring, the learning process continued. These included:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>participation in training webinars organised by the supplier on improving internal communications and sales methods;</li>\r\n<li>continued reading of management literature.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The company also had to pay for the services of a lawyer for three hours a month, a work safety expert for one hour a month; a fire protection surveyor twice a year, an overdue bill collector; and a tax expert, when needed.</p>\r\n<p>From 2009, S&aacute;ndor concentrated on human resources and international relations, with Gergely supervising SAP implementation, leading the service team which now comprised 13 people, and also led the business support unit.</p>\r\n<p>Father and son always had the motivation to build up a serious corporation, and strongly believed that they could outperform competitors. They prepared their first strategic paper (including mission, values, comparative advantages, and mid-term goals) earlier that year, which was explained at a special meeting of all employees. Before the merger there was only informal communication with employees. However, there have always been one or two topics every year that are the focus for improvement. It took about a year to document the many aspects of sales. Another major topic began in 2010, when the company hired a mechanical engineer to take over the knowledge and experience of a 75 year old designer who is eager to leave his designs to the company.</p>\r\n<p>Now S&aacute;ndor Szőllősi, the founding CEO, plans to retire, handing over his role to his son, Gergely. Planned changes in management structure were expected to start in 2012. The Association for Responsible Family Business in Hungary is supporting this changeover, as only a third of businesses successfully make the transition to the next generation and only 5% of family firms create shareholder value beyond the third generation.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The most difficult task concerned the merging of two companies, formerly major competitors, with different cultures and technologies. The merger involved all business units of the two companies. The two sales teams had to sit together in one room, and share experiences and secrets. In the service field it took some time for them to acknowledge each other, but there was no such rivalry among sales people. There the hierarchy built upon the level of expert knowledge, and each one has found his/her position.</p>\r\n<p>AMSY had to make people believe that there is no redundancy, that the company needs all of the employees except the dismissed management. However, up until the end of restructuring in 2010 they lost five out of the ten new employees taken on from the subsidiary. There were several conflicts between employees, and most people who left the company caused some damage &ndash; either financially or to company reputation. One colleague had to move from service to sales and did not work at all. Two new colleagues provided confidential information to a company selling unauthorised third party fluids for the printers, and later joined the competitor. Before the merger, such behaviour was unknown, and the whole company had been totally transparent.</p>\r\n<p>The other challenges related to time. Competitors were waiting for the moment when the subsidiary was taken over, and tried to gain their clients. In the middle of 2007 AMSY took over 300 new clients from the subsidiary and hundreds of machines which they had never operated before. The company contacted clients to reassure them that they would continue to receive a high-quality service. However, half their new clients were lost because of lack of trust and competitors used the subsidiary&rsquo;s previous employees to gain market share. In order to gain client trust, the sales force was trained to develop their communication skills. A large proportion of their efforts was directed toward fighting a new competitor, formed by ex-subsidiary employees, selling a third party&rsquo;s goods to companies traditionally served by them.</p>\r\n<p>AMSY cancelled the lease contract of the other company&rsquo;s headquarters and transferred all employees and equipment to their own plant. The system was not able to handle both inventories, so they had to introduce a new system which could manage all new products and spare parts. The change of management style was an important issue. One difficulty was how to motivate people to accept the implementation of professional workflows. AMSY moved from a family business style operation, to an SAP supported professional operation.</p>\r\n<p>It was obvious that personal ambitions separated workers, and made it far more difficult to manage work. Individuals had illusions about their performance, and the working atmosphere was spoilt. There was a need for objective and comparable measurement and control.</p>\r\n<p>Harmonisation of wages, bonuses, working processes, implementation of SAP was not easy. The biggest challenge was financing the merger; paying the high monthly instalment was a huge burden on the company. They had to increase turnover, and improve profitability year on year. Continuous growth was a must for survival.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>S&aacute;ndor and Gergely think that, in their case, continuity was important. They tried treating everybody the same way but did not get the same result when accommodating ten new colleagues. They think that one of the turning points was when the time came for S&aacute;ndor to choose between becoming a CEO or remaining an entrepreneur. At that point he was able to draw on his 15-year experience in the marking business, wide reading of books on leadership management, and also the knowledge that he and his son&rsquo;s capabilities could well supplement each other. In the Szőllősi&rsquo;s view, S&aacute;ndor&rsquo;s experience in a multinational environment coupled with the drive of Gergely&rsquo;s youth made a good combination.</p>\r\n<p>Gary Harpst&rsquo;s book in particular, <em>The Execution Revolution</em>, dealing with the intricacies of how to grow a small business into a large company, helped them to understand their situation and to realise that they have the same problems that countless others face. However, it was not enough to apply basic management principles, to treat people decently, to stay close to the customer and to make gains in productivity through encouraging people. A specific policy was needed. Although AMSY had been built on open communications, trust, decency, and creativity, more was needed to ensure continued growth. Consequently, the directors of the main supplier sent over their specialists to survey the situation and come up with an action plan.</p>\r\n<p>This covered five areas (sales management/target setting, training support, market understanding, and protection of installed base, marketing and communication) as well as identifying personal ambitions, milestones, and deadlines. Contacts between the US supplier and AMSY became more frequent; with continued support from the supplier. Sales and product skills training sessions were held. The publicly subsidised purchase of the SAP system proved to be a good supporting tool.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>AMSY completed the first phase of restructuring at the end of 2010, sales having improved 40% during the year. In 2011, they were expecting their turnover of HUF 1,500 million (&euro; 5,203,000) to stabilise or grow slightly. The family business had become a small corporation with goals, methodology, measurement, processes and motivated people.</p>\r\n<p>During restructuring, the organisational structure was adapted to fit the new market portfolio and customer needs. The merger was a mixed success.</p>\r\n<p>One product licence taken over from the retired designer is a carton overprinter that can be used in companies having many daily short runs (such as in the frozen food industry, or in wineries). Another is the semi-automatic flat product labeller, three of which have already been sold to small cosmetic companies.</p>\r\n<p>Software development is another case. One colleague has been making applications software for about five years (AMSY paid the tuition fee), and has developed software for some 80 projects ranging from conducting SMS marketing campaigns to control all kinds of marking equipment (small and large character inkjet, laser, print and apply labellers) from a central dispatch office.</p>\r\n<p>In order to facilitate the new branches and increase storage areas for the increased traded volume, the plant needed more space and to accomplish it, the company won a 15% government subsidy for the HUF 90 million (&euro; 312,193) investment project in building up new business lines.</p>\r\n<p>The company has grown from 16 to 30 employees. The new organisation chart is built on functional teams, with clear managerial levels mirroring the operational structure. A third of the company&rsquo;s income comes from the sale of machines, a third from selling supplies and a third from services. The company&rsquo;s strength is services, because marking is a small value in production chain &ndash; but a problem with any machines can block production (in big companies it can costs millions) but AMSY is very fast and flexible in correcting problems.</p>\r\n<p>The AMSY working environment is relaxed, with great improvements in conditions and atmosphere. Employees receive monthly feedback about their performance. Understanding the importance of continually seeking excellence improved a lot with weekly meetings. Everybody understands the real meaning of service, quality and innovation.</p>\r\n<p>The next huge innovation will be to digitise the present service form, which needs to be filled in by hand. The aim has been to prepare digital forms in a Personal Digital Assistant or on a laptop with rolling menus and make them ready on the spot. The challenge has been to speed up documenting equipment faults, the fixing process, and remarks to improve usage. They plan to apply to the new European Fund - KMOP-2011-1.2.1 - to co-finance purchasing software, laptops, and PDAs for this development.</p>\r\n<p>With the final payment for the subsidiary, the three-year contract with the supplier finished. However, AMSY had proved its strength, and asked for a new three-year contract. The supplier agreed, on condition AMSY came up with a clear business plan for the next three years setting out reasonable growth. S&aacute;ndor and Gergely first prepared the plan to guarantee a moderate 2% yearly growth, but this was forced up to 8% by the supplier to challenge AMSY and avoid the company having such a low goal that it becomes lazy.</p>\r\n<p>Compared to the main American supplier other smaller European partners are very good companies but are not as big, and do not have the size and or capability to set goals; they are always happy with AMSY&rsquo;s service. Consequently the attention of the main supplier had an important role in restructuring in many ways.</p>\r\n<p>S&aacute;ndor and Gergely became more entrepreneurial when they addressed company difficulties. They looked at the problems as challenges. They were aware of the value of the company and had a clear vision for the future.</p>\r\n<p>Now they are detailing their action plan to reach, in stages, their strategic goals. They have begun involving all family members. S&aacute;ndor has reinvested 95% of company profit since 2000. So he called together all family members, presented the situation to them and set out the potential value of the family business. In 2012, S&aacute;ndor intends to work less, and Gergely will gradually take over control of the company.</p>\r\n<h3>Implementing a strategic action plan</h3>\r\n<p>S&aacute;ndor and Gergely identified three priorities for future development:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Introduction of ISO-approved quality policy and practice in two years&rsquo; time.</li>\r\n<li>ISO-approved safe working conditions and healthy environment in six years&rsquo; time.</li>\r\n<li>S&aacute;ndor plans to write a non-compulsory &lsquo;founding deed&rsquo; about the principles of a company that can grow, establish new business branches and survive the challenges of times.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>This case shows that establishing and building a company is a complicated process. Managers can undervalue difficulties and time pressure, which forces them to change several areas very quickly. The case has some general implications:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is necessary to have professional advice and support from someone who has directed several mergers or acquisitions;</li>\r\n<li>The organisational structure must be changed and flexible in order to receive new employees;</li>\r\n<li>The company must be well prepared in order to avoid losing too many clients;</li>\r\n<li>It must handle cultural difference as top priority, and make employees believe in the future;</li>\r\n<li>A subsidy from the government/EU, although small, is useful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Attila Petheő and Judit Filep, Corvinus University of Budapest, Small Business Development Centre</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>S&aacute;ndor Szőllősy, Owner and CEO, AMSY</p>\r\n<p>Gergely Szőllősy, Service Manager, AMSY</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company website</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.amsy-jelolestechnika.hu"">www.amsy-jelolestechnika.hu</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Secondary sources</strong></p>\r\n<p>Soma Jankovics: &lsquo;The multinational corporation was kicked out by the Hungarian family business&rsquo;, Origo 9 September 2011; available at: <a href=""http://vallalkozoi.negyed.hu/vnegyed/20110909-megvette-multi-versenytarsat-az-amsy-jelolestechnika-magyar-csaladi-vallalkozas.html"">http://vallalkozoi.negyed.hu/vnegyed/20110909-megvette-multi-versenytarsat-az-amsy-jelolestechnika-magyar-csaladi-vallalkozas.html</a></p>"~"Hungary"~"46 - wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles"~"10-49"~"10-49"~NULL~"business expansion*merger / acquisition"~"2011-11-29"
"ATech, Slovenia"~"ATech elektronika"~"<p>Slovenian company Atech experienced such rapid growth that the owner/manager realised that it was not possible for him to be solely responsible for decision-making and control as he did not have enough time to cope with all issues arising in the daily business activities. An internal restructuring was initiated, including employee empowerment to delegate decisions to the lowest level possible and a separation of ownership and management through the recruitment of a company director responsible for day-to-day management issues.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>ATech was established in 1990 as a Swiss-Slovenian partnership. Owner Davor Jakulin, who had worked at Slovenian railways and as an independent entrepreneur, took a job as a production worker in 1989 in a well-established Swiss company that was a supplier for ABB, the global power and automation technology group. The company director, impressed with Jakulin&rsquo;s entrepreneurial drive and willingness to innovate, gave him the idea of setting up a company in Yugoslavia. At the age of 24, Jakulin was the youngest of four partners to establish the business and took over the role of manager of the newly established company which he named ATech &ndash; Advanced Technologies. Today he recalls being really surprised that the partners entrusted him with the task of establishing the company and setting up the business.</p>\r\n<p>The main reason for establishing ATech as a subcontractor to a Swiss company was the lower cost of labour in Yugoslavia. The company started with electronic manufacturing services (design, test, manufacturing and distribution for electronic components and assembly for original equipment manufacturers). However, after drawing up a business plan, the partners realised that this was not viable enough, so they started a development service for the Swiss company as well. In 1996, Davor Jakulin bought out the other shareholders, becoming sole owner. At that time, the company employed five people and operated out of a garage in a small village, Markov&scaron;čina, in the Primorska region.</p>\r\n<p>Actual company development began that year, because up to then they had been almost completely dependent on the Swiss company. In 1997, the firm produced the first microcontroller-based electronic motor controller and as the company began to grow quickly, Davor Jakulin began to search for additional sources of financing. In 1998 the government-backed Slovenian Development Corporation invested &euro;98,805 in ATech in return for 52% of ownership, leaving Davor Jakulin with the operational managerial control. He said: &lsquo;It was a tough decision, but I had to decide whether the company would move forward or stagnate.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>The investment enabled the company to grow, and in 2001 he bought back the shares and became sole owner. ATech became more firmly focused on developing its own products. From providing electronic manufacturing services, they gradually moved to design and manufacture (ODM). During that year, they were also certified for ISO 9001. They developed the first brushless DC motor controller the following year.</p>\r\n<p>The company soon outgrew the garage works in Markov&scaron;čina, moving to Bač in Materija near Kozina into new 2,000 sq m premises. They made business plans for several years ahead and planned investments in research and development. A new investor was sought, and ATech obtained &euro;600,000 from Fund iEurope in exchange for a 29% equity stake. The company was obliged to report monthly to these new co-owners regarding success, profit margins of different products and programmes, cash flow, investments, forecasts of orders and marketing activities.</p>\r\n<p>The following years brought numerous improvements for ATech. They developed manufacturing capacities and established an additional surface mount device (SMD) line, as well as a new wave soldering line. They introduced the new enterprise resource planning (ERP) type information system, the first sensorless AC motor controller and increased their SMD capacity.</p>\r\n<p>Atech&rsquo;s sales market spread across most of the EU where annual sales were increasing by a compound average growth rate of 25 %, with sales particularly important in countries such as Switzerland, Germany, Italy and Ireland. One of ATech's goals was to enter the American market, following the trend of leading global multinational companies.</p>\r\n<p>The design and development of embedded electronics assembly for home appliance industry, lighting, electronic motor controls and automotive information systems together with expert professional know-how are all characterised by the highest degree of responsibility towards social and natural environment. The recuperation of thermal energy was one of the environmentally friendly solutions for the renovation of the manufacturing hall. ATech is proactively promoting the principles of sustainable growth through its products and received an award for its innovation of the traction unit with integrated motor control electronics for battery powered vehicles, the so- called TR-550.</p>\r\n<p>The greatest added value the company got from its foreign owner was the establishment of good corporate financial management and control procedures. The investors were also very active owners, since they were able to help develop business contacts in the international areas due to their experience in managing comparable quick growing companies. Additional capital allowed ATech to equip themselves better technologically and increased the volume of assembling components more than five times, while at the same time they managed to maintain the status of a strategic partner with crucial buyers. In this period, the company transformed from a craft based company into a high-tech industrial organisation. Fund iEurope exited in 2008.</p>\r\n<p>ATech is an active member of the United Nations Global Compact. In addition to the environment and society, people count among the three key corporate values. A consistently good relationship with employees was acknowledged in the first national project Golden Thread (<em>Zlata nit</em>) in which ATech was ranked among 101 best employers of the year by publisher Dnevnik.</p>\r\n<p>ATech was awarded the &lsquo;Primorsko-Notranjska Gazelle Award&rsquo; of 2003 and was given the &lsquo;Best Entrepreneurship Idea&rsquo; award in 2004&ndash;-05 for its innovativeness. At the Slovenian Innovation Forum, ATech was ranked among the 40 most innovative Slovenian companies in 2007, 2008 and 2009. In 2008, ATech was selected among the top ten most innovative Slovenian companies. They have developed numerous new products and were certified for ISO 14001 in 2007 when they installed the first lean production cell for electronic boards manufacturing.</p>\r\n<p>The educational profile of employees in ATech can be seen from the Table 1. One quarter of employees have university-level degrees, mainly in technical subjects, with one third having secondary and higher professional. The average age of employees is 35.</p>\r\n<table summary="""" border=""0""><caption>Table 1: Educational level of employees</caption><colgroup> <col width=""83.3%"" /> <col width=""16.2%"" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Qualified and nonqualified workers</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>33.80%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Lower vocational (up to 2 years)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>2.80%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Secondary vocational and general</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>30.99%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Higher professional</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>8.45%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>University</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>23.96%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><em>Source: Company data</em></p>\r\n<p>In Table 2, the average number of employees in ATech is presented.

In 2008, he began to delegate authority and responsibility to his co-workers, fearing that, otherwise, the company would be in trouble. Interestingly, the impetus for this move, wasn&rsquo;t the financial crisis but the success of the business. With such fast growth, Jakulin realised that maintaining control was difficult while having sole responsibility for decision-making. The entrepreneur was becoming overloaded and new customers were almost avoided. Davor Jakulin remembers:</p>\r\n<p><em>&lsquo;People were coming to me with good and less good ideas for business and I confirmed and denied them, without having enough time for an argumentative discussion and justifications. I decided more by guessing than actually getting into it, which I confirm, because I definitely didn&rsquo;t have any time for it because of the work overload. I took over the responsibility, without really knowing why.&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>A leap in income from &euro; 5,578,987 to &euro; 7,858,331 in 2008 would meant a growth rate of 50% in 2008 if it hadn&rsquo;t been for impact of the financial crisis in the last quarter of that year. In the last three months of 2008 sales almost completely stopped, indicating something had to be done urgently.</p>\r\n<p>Jakulin felt the need for new leadership and believed that employees ought to be given empowerment in order to accept responsibility for certain decisions. Not only did the demands of the fast growing market have to be addressed, but there was also the question of being able to solve problems before they became too serious.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The internal restructuring and reorganisation at ATech had two phases. The first was employee empowerment, so that decisions could be delegated to as low a level as possible, with managers being able to make business decisions independently and in teams. The second phase involved the separation of ownership and management functions. Management authority was transferred to Massimo Makovac, who joined the company in 2010, on a trial basis as the quality control manager before becoming company director. Now Jakulin runs the company primarily on the basis of financial indicators &ndash; but does not deal with day-to-day management issues.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was carefully planned, to take place from February 2008 to May 2009 with all decisions made by Jakulin. The process was supported by company reorganisation, a competencies model and systematic and targeted training. The empowerment process involved a lot of preparation, as well as delegating certain functions, negotiating, and coordination with people. It followed the classic steps of &lsquo;plan, do, check, act&rsquo;. This is not a quick process since empowerment cannot be forced through; it has to be agreed. About half the employees were directly involved in the process of restructuring. About ten people who were already managers now got more authority.</p>\r\n<p>The first step in the process of empowerment was to assign and discuss new responsibilities and authority with chosen team leaders and their teams. The process intensified in 2008, but the financial crisis changed the company&rsquo;s orientation, since growth was not now a problem and resources had to be focused on solving the sales decline. Jakulin said:</p>\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;Restructuring on the basis of empowerment is a process that demands a lot of contemplation. People want to feel they helped in the success of the company and that others appreciate their cooperation and skills. A lot of employees want to be able to make decisions, look for solutions for problems at the workplace, take initiatives and be responsible for the results. Empowerment is a mash of procedures and behaviour that supports and encourages people in the whole organisation for these trends to come true.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>During the restructuring process, paid for by the company, some employees were promoted; others were moved to other workplaces. Some technicians went on to work in manufacturing. Inter-departmental borders were blurred and teamwork was established, since the success of the entire company, not just one department, was considered as the goal. There was only one compulsory redundancy because of the crisis, and there were no salary reductions or delays in pay; indeed, average salaries increased. The purpose of restructuring was to retain as many people as possible &ndash; individuals that didn&rsquo;t agree with the changes left the company voluntarily. Most changes occurred among administrative and technical employees where numbers declined from 46 to 34. Manufacturing employment increased. Some technicians became sales staff.</p>\r\n<p>In April 2010, Massimo Makovac was appointed as quality control manager on the understanding that, should he prove to be equal to the task, he would become company director. Bringing a quality expert into ATech proved extremely beneficial. Massimo Makovac said:</p>\r\n<p><em>It wasn&rsquo;t an innovation unless, of course, we call a different type of communication between employees an innovation. The key problem wasn&rsquo;t of technical nature, rather mostly the problem of connections and communication in the company. </em></p>\r\n<p>In January 2011, Massimo Makovac took over as director and within a year took over all responsibilities as Jakulin ceased daily management of the company. A more flexible organisation structure was introduced, capable of dealing with constant change. The process of establishing efficient business functions, especially logistics and manufacturing on which cash flow is dependent, took place throughout 2010 and up to June 2011. From June to the end of 2011, a more strategic approach to selling processes and development was adopted.</p>\r\n<p>Jakulin and Makovac meet once a week, mostly outside the company, to discuss planning. They still need to organise more effective communication with the public, and clearly demarcate the director&rsquo;s and entrepreneur&rsquo;s roles in public relations.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenge in restructuring was the effect of the crisis, which meant that the process of empowerment did not succeed fully; nor was it implemented on time. Jakulin, who had planned to head the restructuring had instead to focus on providing necessary leadership for daily running of the business. As not all assigned managers had necessary competences for running their departments the process of restructuring was stopped. If the 2009 crisis had been less severe, this process could have gone through, more or less normally. Jakulin remembers:</p>\r\n<p><em>In March 2009 I was very close to the decision to lower the number of employees by 60%. I went to a bank and asked them what they wanted to see: a positive cash-flow or profit. We agreed for positive cash-flow which we achieved also by selling stock, cancelling a contract with a certain buyer where there were high costs of material and a low profit margin. We took many different measures; for example with the Slovenian Technology Agency, we started some projects that weren&rsquo;t completely in the focus of our activity, but they did employ some of our R&amp;D resources. Mostly, they allowed us to keep our key experts employed. </em></p>\r\n<p>In ATech, ensuring survival got entangled with the process of empowerment and transfer of managerial responsibilities. As Jakulin became preoccupied with ensuring survival, responsibility for restructuring fell to the newly appointed director Makovac. The process of saving the company actually ran counter to the process of restructuring and destroyed some of the already established empowerment relations.</p>\r\n<p>Employees were informed about the empowerment from the beginning at the workers&rsquo; assembly. Reactions differed as some did not agree with their newly assigned roles. Brigita Tomažič, who began at the company in 2008 as a sales clerk is now manager of sales and logistics. She thinks employee reactions during the first phase of restructuring were negative and that better information would have improved them. But, instead, certain responsibilities were assigned and then were not implemented. Jakulin remarks that:</p>\r\n<p><em>Empowerment is like the Pandora&rsquo;s box &ndash; once you open it, all arguments, problems and questions that were suffocated by the organisational structure and leadership methods come pouring out. Life of middle management staff becomes complicated and is quickly tempted to close the lid and make your life easier.</em></p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>An outside consultant was hired to moderate team meetings and to provide technical support for the empowerment process. No other advice or support was needed. On certain issues, Jakulin consulted his network of business partners and colleagues. The company did not receive any public funds for restructuring.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>After 20 years of heading the company, Davor Jakulin stepped down as director and handed over to Massimo Makovac. Now he focuses on development issues, strategic sales and monitoring company performance. Makovac established the new organisational structure fully in 2011. It is now a more flexible organisation capable of dealing with constant changes. The process of establishing new operational methods, especially in logistics and manufacturing, on which cash flow is dependant, took a year, finishing in June 2011. When the second wave of crisis hit in the last months of 2011, this new structure was able to cope.</p>\r\n<p>Due to restructuring, the negative trends were reversed and employment grew in 2010. Gradual growth continued in 2011, with 73 people working for the company in December 2011. Gradual, controlled growth is planned for the future. The company considers training very important, with ATech employees participating in almost 1,800 hours of professional training every year.</p>\r\n<p>After a record high year in 2008 when company made &euro;7,858,331 in sales, their income plummeted because of the economic crisis and in 2009 sales dropped to 56%, to only &euro;4,478,940. In 2010, sales improved to &euro;5,584,418. According to Jakulin, growth continued in 2011. Further income and profit growth is planned, as well as employing more people, as they have invested a lot in development, have a sound infrastructure, good enterprise resource planning (ERP)information system, and micro plan their manufacturing. They have also reduced the throughput time from an average of 19 days to three. Today, 35% of sales go to export customers. They developed a module for collecting data in manufacturing and, together with their ERP system provider, made a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) module in which the data automatically enters the system.</p>\r\n<p>One of the important outcomes of restructuring is also a clear corporate strategy up until 2020. It concentrates on the marketing strategy focused on services and products, and is based on three key competences:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>application know-how;</li>\r\n<li>development and production of motor controllers with connectivity functions;</li>\r\n<li>electronics value chain integration.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>They also underline their skills in producing mass customised products, design and manufacturing and electronic manufacturing services.</p>\r\n<p>Goals are constantly measured by key performance indicators and when needed, the strategy and plans are refined. New products are created from market research based on understanding their customers&rsquo; needs. The company&rsquo;s motto is &lsquo;Our products solve our customers&rsquo; problems,&rsquo; and the general orientation is that:</p>\r\n<p><em>&lsquo;Innovations in electronic systems should contribute to the development in energy conservation, automation and individual wellbeing&rsquo;. </em></p>\r\n<p>A good example of such orientation is the ATech&rsquo;s FUMIS OXY controller for the biomass renewable heat energy sector. This received the national silver acknowledgement for innovation in 2009, awarded by the Slovenian Chamber of Commerce. However the company say they were a little surprised by the positive global reaction to the FUMIS; they are now selling their products to New Zealand, Chile and North America. Two years ago, at a fair in Hannover, they met a client who had flown to the fair all the way from New Zealand just because of them. Jakulin says: &lsquo;Such cases show that we are a company that sets trends. It is a good feeling&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The ATech experience of restructuring showed that it is difficult in small companies to find a critical mass of potential leaders who have the vision, ability and willingness to participate in a developing company. Jakulin said that if planning restructuring today, he would act differently. He would rely less on individuals, plan better and select his new managers more carefully. He said he was surprised to find how little people were prepared to change and do something for their own career growth.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest support that could be established by policymakers would be appropriate entrepreneurial education to increase awareness that companies need nurturing and that appropriate measures need to be put in place before a company encounters problems. The realisation that changes in an organisation are a constant and that a firm&rsquo;s context changes a lot, should be accepted as a normal way of understanding how companies function; when the context changes, everything else changes as well.</p>\r\n<p>The media should focus more on companies that restructure successfully and less on those that are in trouble, which is where most of the interest of the public and policy makers lies.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Miroslav Rebernik, Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management, Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Maribor</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>Davor Jakulin, Entrepreneur, ATech elektronika d.o.o.</p>\r\n<p>Massimo Makovac, Director, ATech elektronika d.o.o.</p>\r\n<p>Brigita Tomažič, Manager of sales logistics, ATech elektronika d.o.o.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company website</strong></p>\r\n<p>ATech. <a href=""http://www.atech.si"">www.atech.si</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Secondary sources</strong></p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Atechov napredek v avtomatizaciji proizvodnje&rsquo;,<em> Avtomatika</em>,No. 88, 2008</p>\r\n<p>GVIN Business information data base: Available at: http://www.gvin.com/ (visited 25 January 2012)</p>\r\n<p>Koražija, Nata&scaron;a: &lsquo;Po kapital v tujino&rsquo;<em>,</em> Manager, No. 1, 3 January 2011, p. 14.</p>\r\n<p>Kukovič, Ur&scaron;ka.: &lsquo;Za uspe&scaron;no vpeljavo je potrebno razumevanje za napake&rsquo;, <em>Finance</em> No. 10, 16 January 2009.

"Automation company, Germany"~"Automation company"~"<p>This German provider of automation processes and switchboards offers systems, components and software for the logistical chain. Founded in the 1970s, the business (60 workers) was taken over in 1983 by the founder&rsquo;s son, who also owned a second firm (35 workers) in the transportation field. The latter business had to file for insolvency in the early 2000s due to high investments and the difficult economy. This led to both companies being taken over by a holding company, but retaining 80% of the workers.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>This case study deals with a German provider of automation and switchboards. The company offers systems, components and software for the complete logistical chain, aiming to support a quick and efficient linkage of all processes within the chain to store raw materials and manufactured products. The firm&rsquo;s services include documenting the client&rsquo;s electrical devices, constructing and assembling equipment, constructing switchboards or providing programmes/software according to the client&rsquo;s requirements.</p>\r\n<p>The company was founded in the late 1970s and initially focused exclusively on switchboard construction. However, in the late 1980s and early 1990s the firm expanded into information technology and communication technology. In 2000, the founder&rsquo;s son who had been working in the company since 1983, took over the business as planned. At this point, the company had about 60 employees, and further plans concerning growth and improvement of quality were implemented.</p>\r\n<p>The new head also owned another firm, with 35 workers. This second company was responsible for the construction or modification of vans to protect main company from any law suits for compensation in case of transport problems.</p>\r\n<p>In the early 2000s, the company had to file for insolvency because of high investments and the difficult economic situation in Germany. A comprehensive restructuring was initiated, which led to both companies being taken over by a holding.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>About three years before the insolvency was filed for, the company was asked to equip a client&rsquo;s trucks with devices and control panels, in order to support the client&rsquo;s own new technique of transporting . The contract gave the client the right to contract a competitor instead, if the production capacities of the company were not sufficient.</p>\r\n<p>The first order was fulfilled without problems, but the second order was delayed because of the larger order volume. With the third order it became obvious that the production capacities were not sufficient. At this point the company had only one production site which was remodelled in order to fulfill the orders. However, with increasing order volumes and a positive outlook in the overall market &ndash; this measure was not enough. The entrepreneur therefore decided to invest about &euro; 700,000 on new land and the construction of a new production hall. Production processes were also overhauled; new machinery was bought and equipment constructed. This was funded from within the company.</p>\r\n<p>However, shortly afterwards, the number and volume of orders from the main client began to drop. The client&rsquo;s own new technology was not meeting market expectations, and the client stopped the project without giving any notice to the company. This meant that the extended production capacities were redundant, and also that the company couldn&rsquo;t raise the funding required for the construction of the new production hall.</p>\r\n<p>At about the same time, the company founder retired. He received a pay-off, and although this amount was much too low to compensate the work of his lifetime, it damaged the company&rsquo;s already weak liquidity, although neither father nor son realised this at the time.</p>\r\n<p>The situation only became obvious when the general economic situation in Germany deteriorated and orders for the company&rsquo;s core business dropped. This stifled any possibility of financing the additional costs caused by the business expansion. The company was still making sales, but it was obvious they were not enough to cover future expenditure, and that the company&rsquo;s debts would increase.</p>\r\n<p>Consequently, the company filed for insolvency and a comprehensive restructuring started.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process started with filing the insolvency which was done by filling a simple form in the insolvency court. From this point on, the entrepreneur still was the owner of the company but was no longer managing it. Within few hours an insolvency administrator took over all the rights and obligations of managing the business. This meant, for example, that the entrepreneur had to get authorisation for any entrepreneurial activities and to point out, in all negotiations with clients, that any deals were conditional on getting the administrator&rsquo;s go-ahead. At a personal level this caused the entrepreneur some doubt about his role in the company, especially regarding clients or suppliers. However, his relations with the administrator were generally comfortable as the administrator recognised his expertise and accepted his suggestions.</p>\r\n<p>The employees, according to the entrepreneur, had already known the company was in difficulties, having experienced a delay, of a couple of days, in their wage payments. They had been informed of this by the company, and accepted the situation. There were no non-payments nor wage reductions.</p>\r\n<p>On the day of filing for insolvency, the entrepreneur on his own initiative released a press statement about the situation. He wanted to avoid the spread of rumours and half-truths, so that he could get the company back on its feet and continue running it. Even in the difficult situation of the company crisis, he was still interested in being an entrepreneur and facing the related challenges. Furthermore, after investigating the causes, he was convinced that the company in general offered high qualitative and competitive products and services, had good clients, and that the insolvency was not caused by a continuous deterioration of the business situation. Rather, he identified the high investment for the new production hall and the withdrawal of capital as the cause of the crisis. Accordingly, the entrepreneur together with his authorised commercial officer and the insolvency administrator developed a restructuring plan by, for example, rating the enterprise and establishing a liquidity and finance plan.</p>\r\n<p>To do this he talked to his main clients and suppliers. These, due to their longstanding business relationship, were convinced of the quality of the company&rsquo;s services and wanted to continue dealing with the company. To maintain their trust, the company then supplied its main clients with the its monthly balance sheet to keep them informed about the development of the restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>The banks were also approached and kept informed. Immediately after filing for insolvency the private accounts of the entrepreneur&rsquo;s family had been frozen but, relatively quickly, the banks were willing to negotiate. They saw the entrepreneur as a diligent businessman and agreed &ndash; after tough negotiations &ndash; to restructure the financial funds under consideration.</p>\r\n<p>The professional crisis management proved to be successful: Potential investors quite soon approached the insolvency administrator as it became public that the company had a sound basis and good prospects if additional capital could be secured. Two months after filing for insolvency, a new company was founded and few months later took over all activities of the insolvent company. The entrepreneur kept 20% of the shares of the new company, with three new partners buying the rest. These were local investors known to the entrepreneur by name, but with whom he not previously had any business contact. Together they agreed on a plan for the new business.</p>\r\n<p>The cash injection, plus the concentration on the firm&rsquo;s core competences meant the firm could regain its secure market position. About three years after the insolvency, the company profits were at the level before the crisis, and the number of employees was back to about 60 after the redundancies caused by the insolvency (see below).</p>\r\n<p>About five to six years after the insolvency, a holding took over 80% of the shares of the company by buying out the new partners. This enabled the company to expand its range of services. At about the same time also the last administrative steps of the insolvency were completed.. The entrepreneur still owned 20% of the company.</p>\r\n<p>About one year later, the holding also bought the entrepreneur&rsquo;s shares. He decided to do this because of plans to integrate the holding with the company. If he had not sold up, his share in the new company would have dropped from 20% to 8% with, to his dismay, his level of security collateral remaining the same, increasing his risk while at the same time reducing his possibilities to influence company decisions.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time there were plans to expand the activities of the second company which had not been affected by the insolvency procedure. The plans included transferring selected employees and assets from the holding, but banks demanded the entrepreneur&rsquo;s private assets, including his home and life insurance, as collateral to finance the plan. As this was not feasible for him, he also sold the second company to the holding. The entrepreneur now acts as a chief executive officer of one of the firms of the holding.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenge was dealing with the banks. Immediately after filing for insolvency, not only were the entrepreneur&rsquo;s business accounts closed, but also his private one. He had to apply to the banks before he could even cover private expenses. The bank employee who had been his longstanding contact was no longer responsible for him, so a new relationship of trust had to be fostered during intensive negotiations necessary as the suggested conditions partly were not feasible.</p>\r\n<p>It was not possible to restructure without additional finance from banks or new partners, because of the firm&rsquo;s great need for capital, which therefore demanded the entrepreneur&rsquo;s private assets as collateral..</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The entrepreneur and his tax consultant considered various possible solutions to the problem of falling revenue and increasing debt, but filing for insolvency was thought to be the most realistic. Later he was supported by the nominated insolvency administrator in the planning and implementation of the new strategies.</p>\r\n<p>However, he received the most important support on restructuring from within his company, namely from his authorised commercial officer who supported him with business expertise and advice. He also received important personal support from his family.</p>\r\n<p>The entrepreneur does not feel the company had any further need for support from public authorities or private consultants in the restructuring. However he mentions that, in general, a continuous system of support for medium-sized enterprises would be welcome &ndash; not only helping with the annual drafting of the balance sheet but also in cases of crisis whereby business consultants familiar with the enterprise might be able to pinpoint alternative courses of action.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process has led to two rebranded companies, now part of a group, which were previously run by an owner-manager. However, their profiles remain almost unchanged. The original owner is now chief executive officer and, in the third business year after starting the restructuring, the profits and the number of employees were the same as they were before the company crisis.</p>\r\n<p>At the point of filing for insolvency the company had 60 employees, none of whom was dismissed at this time. The reason for this was that the company wanted to maintain sufficient resources for the hoped for upswing, as well as the loyalty of the family-led company towards long-standing employees. The workers also did not have to accept a reduction of working time or wages, although there sometimes was a couple of days delay in the payment.</p>\r\n<p>In the medium term there only were minor personnel changes. The insolvency led to two staff members being dismissed, with about five others volunteering to leave the company in order to prevent further job losses if the company closed. Some of these workers have now returned to the company.</p>\r\n<p>About eight years after the restructuring, about 80% of the workers employed by the two companies before the insolvency were still working in the new firms. The loss of the remaining 20% can be considered as a natural fluctuation.</p>\r\n<p>From the entrepreneur&rsquo;s personal perspective, the company insolvency is an experience he does not want to repeat. Nevertheless, it did have a benefit, in that he has a new perspective on banks, brought about positive learning effects. He now sees himself and his company, more as customers than as applicants; increasingly comparing the quality and prices of offers and negotiating more.</p>\r\n<p>The integration of the initially owner-managed companies into the holding structure introduced administrative changes for the company&rsquo;s management. There are more restrictions on investment planning or staff decisions which partly result in less flexibility and a more limited scope for action. However the holding&rsquo;s strong financial backing means that larger orders can be fulfilled without problems, and better deals can be had from suppliers or providers of services (such as insurance).</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The entrepreneur says an important factor for success in entrepreneurial activity is expertise in the economic/commercial field, next to technical know-how. He feels that there is a lack of public support for making available business education and advice on business management. Many entrepreneurs become self-employed because of their strengths in the technical field. Even if they are good at administration they may need expert support because of their work load and the complexity of identifying, for example, appropriate financial instruments or strategies for development. A medium-sized company often cannot afford to employ a specialised worker for this area, instead hiring temporary external consultants who lack continuity of knowledge about the company as well as familiarity with the long-term aims and working methods of the entrepreneur. Often only the current status of the company is assessed, but no courses of action for the future are pinpointed as soon as a first sign of deterioration of the situation is seen. This results in a lack of an early warning system early pinpointing potential drawbacks.</p>\r\n<p>He is convinced that company insolvency is not caused by a single, isolated aspect, but by a combination of various elements which can be internal or external to the firm. Internal aspects can include entrepreneurial mistakes such as keeping employees on for too long, partly in order to be ready for the hoped for upswing, and party due to a feeling of social responsibility of a family-led company towards the employees.</p>\r\n<p>He also feels that there should be two people that a company can turn to in time of insolvency: someone that can give social or psychological support, as well as an economic/business expert within the company in order to internally discuss strategic decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Above all, he recommends that companies experiencing such a crisis should carefully evaluate the causes and approach relevant stakeholders such as banks, employees, clients and suppliers, communicating with them openly, telling them of the situation and of plans for the future. Furthermore, one&rsquo;s own initiative and creativity is also necessary to develop and implement strategies. In negotiations with banks or other finance providers he recommends being confident, having the courage to negotiate, while being open to the perspectives and requirements of the negotiation partner.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Irene Mandl, Eurofound</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interview</strong></p>\r\n<p>Previous owner/manager and now chief executive officer of the company</p>"~"Germany"~"28 - manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c."~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"(avoiding) bankruptcy*merger / acquisition"~"2011-09-08"

The system of motivating workers enabled the company to see an increase in profits, sales and added value.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>BIOK laboratorija, a private company, was founded in 1988 and is the leading producer of beauty/skin care cosmetics in the Baltic States. It specialises in the development and production of body, hair and tooth care products. Since its foundation, BIOK has launched a few leading brands, such as ‘Rasa’, ‘Aras’, ‘Margarita’ and ‘Thai’. From the beginning, no significant changes in the area of operations were made. However, when it was taken over in 2005 by its new owners, changes were made in the scope of business, and following restructuring the company increased its product range. At the moment it consists of 160 items (from 60 in 2006). This indicates penetration into new categories and the increased importance of product development. Products are based on locally sourced ingredients, such as beer and nettles.</p>\r\n<p>BIOK has grown steadily since its inception, except in 1999–2001 due to the Russian crisis. Even in 2009, when the Lithuanian economy as a whole shrank, the company was able to sustain growth. </p>\r\n<p>The company is located in an industrial area of the Lithuanian capita, Vilnius. It has no retail outlets of its own or other activities in beauty care value chain. The only significant feature of the company is that a high proportion (66%) of employees have higher education qualifications. Despite its current growth, the number of its employees is stable, at about 40.</p>\r\n<p>BIOK can also be characterised as an international company. When it first began it imported packaging and some ingredients, but now it exports 8% of its products. The company has also reached the level of production where it can now locally outsource products or services such as packaging, ingredients, design and advertising.</p>\r\n<p>The company was taken over in 2005 by three persons with a background in investment banking. The company founders, its previous owners, were biochemists. The new owners appointed Linas Čereška as managing director. His background is in international trade and marketing. He also has over ten years’ experience in telecommunication and parcel logistics industries, client care and marketing activities. New marketing and finance managers were also appointed and the new team started work in 2005–2006.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the low number of employees, there is no works council or relationship with a trade union in the company. There are no strategies for human resources or corporate social responsibility. There is only a verbal agreement to be honest to all stakeholders. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>When the ownership changed, it was obvious that there would also be some changes at the company’s operational level. The main impetus here was the return on investments, as the new owners focused on turnover and profitability and related measures. </p>\r\n<p>From the point of view of external forces, it was obvious that there was potential in the white cosmetics market. The main competitors are international brands with no local adaptation. Other local or regional companies were rather weak, without significant product development, branding or proper distribution. BIOK, however, already had well established local brands. </p>\r\n<p>Much more important factors, which led to the restructuring, were internal. First of all, company was very much product and trade oriented. There was no clear focus on branding and understanding local needs of customers. There was also a lack of new ideas in product development. Moreover, it was commonly felt that the company had exhausted all possible ways of facilitating any more growth. </p>\r\n<p>The new owners therefore had the challenge of challenging the prevailing mind-set in order to explore existing market potential.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In the beginning, it was challenging for the new management team to change the thinking of other management staff. As already mentioned, there were three new members of the top management (managing director, and marketing and finance managers), each considered of crucial importance to the restructuring, and they had to overcome scepticism towards their ideas for new products and initiatives. A common reaction was ‘this will not work’ or ‘we have tried this before’. The first step therefore was to have a joint brainstorming meeting about new product ideas with members of management who had been with company before the takeover; the production manager, sales manager, quality control and new product development (laboratory) managers. </p>\r\n<p>The next step was to develop and test the products in the market. Involving the management team in decision-making was unusual in the cultural framework of the company. As the ownership of new product idea was shared among all team members, those were the fastest new product development results in the history of the company. Within the period of three months, a new product was agreed, developed and distributed to the market. Market response was positive, so this was a first victory and an inspiring example of the capabilities of new team to the rest of employees. </p>\r\n<p>To begin with, the restructuring was quite informal, focusing on changes in management, planning, and encouraging team work with the discussion of targets, sharing of ideas and getting positive results from this. A formal restructuring plan was neither approved nor announced, there were more structural changes targeting at business expansion and later o turned into a real restructuring process. </p>\r\n<p>The new owners, now on the board, were very active in planning and reviewing performance measures. They and the managing director set an ambitious target of 10% growth in turnover and profitability, based on the development of new products.  This was also a new toll in company’s management culture. The new targets were defined during the normal planning process, bottom up, in different way from the previous experience. This led to a shift in the company’s culture, from an attitude of ‘this is not possible’ to ‘we know what we have to achieve, but is this realistic?’</p>\r\n<p>After the first success with new products, a new planning system led to further changes. These were focused on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>branding</li>\r\n<li>clients</li>\r\n<li>logistics, </li>\r\n<li>more outsourcing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This involved the whole management team working in supermarkets as product presenters, while the new branding efforts strengthened the company’s position in the market. The whole team developed a clear understanding of their products’ competitive advantages, and what they should do to facilitate further development. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process, which began in 2005, was reactive rather than planned and the results of this from 2007 should be considered as arising from a company development strategy rather than from a separate and prepared restructuring plan. However, although the changes were informal, they were based on naturally taken actions and steps, which were results of proper and adequate management and the right choice of development strategy, leading to business expansion.</p>\r\n<p>There was also no specific written strategy for personnel. New management, appointed by the new owners, occupied the most important positions, and had their own ideas on selection, motivation, aspiration, and conveying the vision of company to every employee. Middle management changed organically; although no manager or employee was dismissed, a sales manager and a production manager left the company a few months after restructuring started.</p>\r\n<p>By 2009, when the initial restructuring was over, the total number of managers (top and medium-level) was seven and the average of employees per manager was six. </p>\r\n<p>No employees were hired during the restructuring process, only a natural turnover of personnel has taken place. The share of new employees averaged about 20.5% per year, which indicates the company’s moderate growth, while the share of employees who left the company in 2009 was 18%, which indicates a moderate level of satisfaction with job and working conditions in the company. People, who left the company voluntarily, could not expect state help or company support. However, they did not need this, or any re-training, as they were highly qualified, and their skills were in demand on the labour market. About 66% of the company’s employees have university education, and the average age is about 36, which implies that employees are ambitious. Two thirds of employees are women, which gives some stability to the company’s turnover of personnel. However, such a personnel structure also means that salaries are quite high compared with the average national wage. Indeed, salaries rose steadily, at a rate of about 1.2%, despite the global economic crisis.</p>\r\n<p>During the restructuring process, the system of motivating individuals was sustained; every person is rewarded on overall performance, with work load being adjusted to individual needs. Together with other structural, management and working culture changes, this motivation system enabled the company to see an increase in profits, sales and added value. In 2009 the profit per employee was close to LTL 33,000 (about €9,500) compared to almost LTL 34,000 (up to € 10,000) of costs for one employee, and up to LTL 333,000 (€ 95,000) of sales per employee and over LTL 236,000 (over € 68,000) of added value per employee. An input of employees into profit, added value creation and sales exceed 50% and indicates the quite high job productivity and profitability of company.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenge in terms of restructuring in the BIOK case was to release internal potential. </p>\r\n<p>The first task was to improve the overall atmosphere in the company after the takeover. The new management team acted more flexibly and freely in terms of personnel policy. As has been mentioned, there were no drastic changes in the management structure or in the general organisational structure affecting ordinary employees. There were only minor changes in payment or motivation system. All these actions enabled to reduce the resistance to change and created trust in the new management team.</p>\r\n<p>The next task was to break the prevailing clichéd way of thinking. The company was short of new ideas and confidence. However, the involvement of management and the sharing of new ideas proved the way to success. Open information about achievements, no matter how positive or negative, also added confidence and helped build team spirit.</p>\r\n<p>Following this, it was important to kick-start the product development process, with the key words being speed to the market and flexibility. The successful development of new products at the first attempt served as a good example of the potential of the company.</p>\r\n<p>Another challenge was for the management team, especially in the sense of product development, to be always be a few years ahead of the market. </p>\r\n<p>A common ailment of growing businesses is to demarcate functions, so that employees are involved only in operations outlined in their job description. Such a strict functional distribution is not healthy for SMEs. From the start, the new management team gave a good example of taking on different roles such as packaging products, and talking to potential customers in supermarkets. The team also introduced work rotation, with employees moving from department to department.</p>\r\n<p>This changed the company’s culture to a more ‘family’ style atmosphere, with people working in teams, sharing responsibilities, and feeling part of the company. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The new management team received no external advice or support during the takeover. However, they successfully implemented changes by using their previous experience and tuning their relationship with rest of the management team. </p>\r\n<p>An important role was played by board members, especially at the first steps of restructuring. They asked the right questions, encouraged the planning process and set ambitious targets. After the first year the have taken a back seat, now following up on the most important performance measures.</p>\r\n<p>Linas Čereška feels there is no need, in the case of restructuring for a business expansion, for any external support or financial resources. The company should use its own internal resources and go through changes on their own with all the attendant ups and downs. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>BIOK was a growing and profitable business before the takeover and restructuring, with problems more related to a lack of confidence and ideas. Management has developed the company using its existing potential. </p>\r\n<p>The overall outcome of restructuring is positive:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>constant growth of the company value, despite the\r\nnational financial crisis;</li>\r\n<li>export growth;</li>\r\n<li>portfolio diversification. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Restructuring made a minor impact on employees. There were no significant changes in the payment system, and no significant impact on the number of employees. </p>\r\n<p>There are two outcomes worth mentioning:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Due to the diversification of the firm’s portfolio,\r\nplus the development of exports and spreading internal functions, the company is\r\nmore risk-resistant;</li>\r\n<li>After restructuring, the company can make a bigger impact\r\non the local economy as it can now buy some materials from local suppliers,\r\nrather than importing them. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>There are some important differences in the restructuring of SMEs compared with that of large organisations. In an SME, it is difficult to distinguish restructuring processes from everyday activities. For example, the restructuring process in BIOK started in 2005 but it is not clear if it has yet finished. </p>\r\n<p>Another issue is a clear split of responsibilities. Linas Čereška says that, for SMEs it is crucial to have a more ‘family’ type of organisation, where people are interested in more than just their activities. It is not clear if such a set up would become an obstacle to growth in the future, but it was important for BIOK development.</p>\r\n<p>In large organisations changes could be facilitated or even implemented by the use of external resources, mainly management consultants. In an SME, however, a company could rely on itself and make changes without external support. Employees, not able to cope with such changes, should leave.</p>\r\n<p>Linas Čereška has identified certain major factors vital to the success of restructuring:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>clear vision and new ideas for further development at the\r\ntakeover stage;</li>\r\n<li>quick-wins and outcomes are of crucial importance in\r\ngaining trust and strengthening confidence among employees;</li>\r\n<li>setting realistic, but ambitions plans;</li>\r\n<li>no compromises on product quality.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Edmundas Piesarskas, EKT</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interview</b></p>\r\n<p>Linas Čereška, Manager, Biok Laboratory</p>\r\n<p>C<b>ompany website</b></p>\r\n<p> <a HREF=""http://www.BIOK.lt/"">http://www.BIOK.lt/</a></p>\r\n<p><b>Secondary sources</b></p>\r\n<p>UAB ‘BIOK laboratorija’ benchmarking report</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Lithuania"~"20 - manufacture of chemicals and chemical products"~"10-49"~"10-49"~NULL~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2011-12-06"
"Blažič robni trakovi, Slovenia"~"Blažič robni trakovi"~"<p>Slovenian company Blazic restructured by acquiring its German supplier firm as it was interested in producing the basic product itself. Buying a company that already had the required technology and know-how was thought to be the better alternative to investing in its own technology.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1 class=""subtitle""></h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Blažič robni trakovi is a leading provider of edge-bandings in Europe and a distributor of material for the furniture industry. The company is also the exclusive sales agent in Slovenia and the Balkans for a number of well-known trademarks.</p>\r\n<p>The company was founded in 1987 by Franc Blažič as a small joinery to produce furniture. Since the market then was inadequately supplied with edge-bandings, he developed an innovative machine for cutting sheaves and joining veneer tapes. A year later, Blažič then invented a machine for cutting melamine edge-bandings of different widths. The workshop next to the family home soon became too small and in 1997 business and manufacturing facilities were bought from a former Slovenian printing company. These buildings were thoroughly renovated and in 1999, the business was transferred to the new location at Bravničarjeva 18 in Ljubljana. Soon after, an extension was added, with a new offices and a warehouse constructed in 2008, meaning an increase in space from the original 2,800 m<SUP>2</SUP> to 6,800 m<SUP>2</SUP>. Company warehouses, at other locations, provide. There are two main warehouses in Slovenia, not including warehouses that are a necessary part of shops, providing an additional 1,400 m<SUP>2</SUP> of space. The company also has warehouses in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro for distribution to local markets. The new store in Ljubljana (500 m<SUP>2</SUP>) is located in the city centre and has a large car park. </p>\r\n<p>Today, Blažič is the market leader for edge-banding tapes used in the furniture industry. Customers are offered the widest selection of products in different patterns as well as thickness and width sizes. Over the years, the sales programme has been expanded, first by the addition of furniture hardware and metal products, then by flat-surface materials and subsequently, by adhesives, surface materials and joinery tools. The company stocks more than 25,000 different items and collaborates with 70 different suppliers from 17 countries. Their competitive advantage is fast delivery. </p>\r\n<p>Blažič have developed both wholesale and retail sales market networks. They have five points of sales in Slovenia and are gradually expanding abroad. They have already established outlets in Croatia (2003), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2006), Montenegro (2008), Serbia and Macedonia (both 2010). In 2011 Blažič bought Furwa, Furnierkanten GmbH in Germany. The company also actively sells in the Austrian, German, Belgian, UK, Russian, Italian and Ukrainian markets. They collaborate with more than 3,500 sales partners. </p>\r\n<p>In 2009, Mihael Blažič, the son of the founder, took over the company, after a 10-year process of managerial succession from his father. With Mihael becoming a director, the company began to internationalise, establishing a subsidiary in Zagreb in 2002/2003, his first major solo project. This was followed by an intensive expansion and establishment of subsidiaries in the Balkans. During this time, Franc remained managing director. However, such a situation meant heavy responsibility but limited power for Mihael with the result that Franc formally delegated the position of director to his son. With a new leader, the business developed strongly, especially with expanding operations to foreign markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<CAPTION>Table 1: Blažič robni trakovi: Average number of employees, sales income and profit (€)</CAPTION>\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""20.10%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.70%"">\r\n      <COL width=""17.80%"">\r\n      <COL width=""16.90%"">\r\n      <COL width=""15.70%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.00%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n </TD>\r\n<TH>2006</TH>\r\n<TH>2007</TH>\r\n<TH>2008</TH>\r\n<TH>2009</TH>\r\n<TH>2010</TH>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>Average number of employees</b></p>\r\n<p><b>(not including international subsidiaries)</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>14.24 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>55.70 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>71.54 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>80.01 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>85.35 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">Sales income (€)</TH>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>8,583,680 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>10,793,328 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>11,959,.154 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>11,195,108 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>12,543,150 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">Profit (€)</TH>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>581,587 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>311,047 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>715,334 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>38,383 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>-394,998 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">Added value per employee (€)</TH>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>18,608 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>24,097 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>40,812 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>29,390 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>19,327 </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p><i>Source: <a HREF=""http://www.gvin.com/"">GVIN business information data base</a> </i></p>\r\n<p>The slight sales income reduction in Blažič in 2009 does not indicate a real drop in market share. Rather, it involves a redistribution of sales, where the newly-established enterprises in the group account for a higher share.</p>\r\n<p>Rapid growth in terms of both markets and product range required development in knowledge and employment. The company employs 125 people, 90 in Slovenia and 35 abroad. The number of employees has increased considerably over the last three years. They are a young and promising team, with extensive know-how and practical experience. Most employees are experts in the timber industry, ranging from joiners to university graduates in wood science and technology. Since customers expect a complete service, as well as help in finding solutions, they regularly attend professional training and education courses both in Slovenia and abroad. The company does not have a works council.</p>\r\n<p>The company’s extensive growth began with 35% growth over 2004/2005. During this time they have not been able to formalise organisational processes and future plans in the form of written strategies. The company has no written HRM or corporate social responsibility strategy. Management closely monitors personnel turnover, which is of course to some extent dependent on the overall economic situation. They are more interested in why employees’ leaving the company voluntarily, although managers say that, in the last four years, only one worker per year has left the company voluntarily.</p>\r\n<p>In 2008, Blažič won the ‘Gazelle’ competition for the fastest growing company in central Slovenia, and was also nominated for the prize again in 2009. In 2010, the company, as a manufacturer of boundary strips of veneer, was certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) as complying with the standard for sustainable and controlled usage of wood in a complete production chain. This demonstrates they are among the most progressive companies in the sector regarding environmental sustainability. The company has received many other awards and nominations recently, including, in 2010, a recognition rating from Creditcheck. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Blažič have experienced various types of restructuring during the last ten years - mostly business expansion. The first expansion refers to Blažič rubne trake d.o.o. in Croatia, where a retail store was opened in Zagreb in September 2003. Since then, the company undertook intensive internationalisation, setting up subsidiaries in the Balkans. Simultaneously, the company focused on Western European markets, looking for business opportunities, but the process of business expansion in this part of Europe was not planned.</p>\r\n<p>The focus of this case study is the acquisition of German supplier Furwa, Furnierkanten GmbH. The management described the three most important drivers for this restructuring event. </p>\r\n<p>The first was opportunity. Furwa got to a breaking point when the owner was unable to transfer the business to members of his family and, due to age and ill health, decided to sell up. Furwa was founded by Armin Wiblishauser in 1974. His family had been in the woodworking business for generations and he invented veneer edges in continuous rolls. Furwa is nowadays the world’s third biggest company in the niche production of veneer edges, employing 35 people and generating €6 million sales income.</p>\r\n<p>The second motive was that Blažič had just lost its major supplier at that time, the world’s second largest company in this niche market, due to a takeover by a global manufacturer.</p>\r\n<p>The third motive concerns technology. Blažič wanted to produce Furwa’s basic product themselves. It is a highly complex process that requires a large and expensive production line. Blažič was then considering either investing in its own new technology (which they tested with a potential supplier while negotiating the purchase of Furwa) or buying a company that already had it all. By purchasing Furwa, the company also gained much from the transfer of know-how as well as the expansion of sales markets.</p>\r\n<p>The decision to acquire Furwa was led by the desire to speed the firm’s internationalisation. Blažič believe the acquisition to be an appropriate investment due to Furwa technology, complementary to Blažič. In this way, Blažič covered the entire segment offering veneer edge bandings. Another aspect, of course, is the expansion of the distribution network by taking control of Furwa channels: 80% of Furwa’s production is exported. Blažič has, therefore, acquired many new markets in North and South America, and Africa. Furwa has a strong market reputation derived from its knowledge and technology developed in a narrow market niche – a reputation Blažič has now gained through acquisition. In this specialised niche market experience and tacit knowledge are critical to creating a competitive advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Blažič first considered acquiring Furwa in mid-2010. Basic interviews with the owner, management and other experts in branches were maintained for about three months. They also consulted legal and tax advisors. The process of selling the company was held up because the owner felt his business was worth much more than he ultimately got. Furwa was acquired in March 2011, after four months of intense negotiation. </p>\r\n<p>Before the purchase, Blažič management prepared a detailed three-year business plan, examining the effects that the purchase of Furwa would have on Blažič. </p>\r\n<p>Our correspondent has pointed that the family business philosophy common to both companies contributed to the success of the acquisition. Their intention was to change as little as possible. The main reason for this was the company’s family tradition and their sensitiveness to change. Alignment of business was done with the introduction of a new communication protocol. They discussed targets with the Furwa management and employees and aligned products and market appearance. All this was done gradually; step by step. The cultural compatibility of the two companies supported the situation. Post-acquisition integration took place relatively easily because of this compatibility.</p>\r\n<p>The purchase of Furwa was a leveraged buyout, Blažič financing the acquisition through German banks, with 15% of the deal coming from its own resources. As part of the loan agreement, German banks stipulated that Furwa’s management would not be replaced.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Workers at Blažič did not accept the acquisition of the German supplier without hesitation. They felt quite a lot of frustration and fear that the acquisition would cause unwanted change. However, management attempted to calm these fears by clearly communicating their plans, preparing a written notification, so that all employees were informed about acquisition objectives. Reactions to this were mixed, although managers and some employees accepted the decision very positively. In general, workers are less afraid about their own future at the company.</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, some customers in Slovenia reacted to the move quite negatively. The reason for this may lie in the fact they were not informed directly by Blažič side, but from magazines or newspapers. Anyway, they did not take any specific action, but  just let it go.</p>\r\n<p>At Furwa, the lengthy acquisition process meant that the employees were prepared for changes. They feared that production would be relocated to the Balkans, but with appropriate information at joint meetings, Blažič fostered a basic level of trust. It took a year after the takeover for employees to recognise the aspirations and vision of the new owner, and become confident about the future. Blažič is aware that the establishment of mutual trust requires time and that there are no shortcuts.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The acquisition of a foreign company is a demanding undertaking, and to facilitate this in terms of handling and knowledge of formal procedures, Blažič made extensive use of Slovenian and German experts and consultants. The acquisition process was led by Luka Novak, a Blažič manager at the time and now also responsible for managing the operations at Furwa. During the acquisition process, he had legal, tax and financial advisory assistance from local German consultants and from one external adviser on remaining issues such as finding good practices in the local environment. The advisor had been involved in a number of previous takeovers or mergers of similar sized companies. They discussed potential mistakes and threats, and also the advantages of such connections. </p>\r\n<p>All support providers were from the private sector, and the company says that everyone, especially the local German specialists, were highly satisfactory. However Luka Novak was more critical of the support they received from the Slovenian side. He admitted they didn’t undertake any in-depth research regarding government support for their activities due to time constraints. He feels that, in Slovenia, the business support structure is simply too weak. Even if it exists, it is lost in bad communications between government and entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>No workers left because of the acquisition and Furwa’s employees and organisation structure remain the same. This was clearly the vertical integration; no bigger synergies in HR were developed.  </p>\r\n<p>Luka Novak, says he learned many valuable lessons from the process including an insight into the functioning of acquisition processes abroad, and a thorough knowledge of the German business environment and customs. A key challenge for him was to ensure that the decision to purchase the company wouldn’t be regretted later and that Furwa achieves positive performance in the next business year.</p>\r\n<p>The current economic situation has caused market contraction for Furwa products. At the same time, it is also necessary to finance the costs of acquisition and to avoid Furwa’s development processes being negatively affected. Consequently, Blažič decided to use Furwa’s profits to finance the acquisition. All other issues in the acquired company are running smoothly, with no loss of staff or reduction in pay. Blažič is well aware how vital this is to building the necessary mutual trust and cooperation, in order to maximise production. </p>\r\n<p>Furwa has clear plans for the future, with six projects outlined. They particularly want to attract new, large, customers, such as IKEA, with the hope that they will bring in for example, 20% of total sales in future. Operating results will largely depend on the success or failure of these projects.</p>\r\n<p>Furwa’s principal business objective (if they have sufficient equity) is to develop a distribution network in Germany. They are aware that this is a very demanding project in terms of capital, since a good salesperson in Germany is paid at least €60,000 per year. Profits generated will be primarily aimed at developing a sales network in Germany. Furwa is currently focused entirely on the B2B segment (selling to large factories or distributors), while Blažič wants, because of Germany’s enormous market size, to target the B2C segment (selling to small cabinet makers, not to the final customer).</p>\r\n<p>Blažič is already planning to extend operations into other European markets. In 2011, they employed a salesperson in Budapest. He is in charge of searching for potential new partners in agreed foreign markets such as Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>\r\n<p>Synergies created between the two companies relate largely to the acquisition of new skills. Blažič has gained new production knowledge as well as knowledge of new markets. They have gathered many new contacts and forged new business ties. They organise regular visits by German technologists to Slovenia and vice versa. Many positive effects cannot be directly assessed; however the experience of both parties is enriched.</p>\r\n<p>Blažič heavily invests in the development of new edge-banding tapes, as new trends continue to emerge at an increasing pace in the particleboard industry. New boards also call for new types of edge-banding tape.  They strive to offer customers products that meet even the most demanding trends in product development, in terms of quality and affordable prices. In order to achieve these goals, they need to stimulate all employees to participate in development processes. For this reason, an intensive system of encouraging and rewarding employees for innovative pursuits is in preparation. There are fewer opportunities for manufacturing improvements, as only 10% of revenue derives from their own production; everything else is brokerage/trade. At the same time, great opportunities for improvements remain in administrative processes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Blažič now has the title of the fastest growing company in Slovenia (‘Gazelle’ award). According to our interviewee, a key advantage of a gazelle is its flexibility. The company is happy with its decision to acquire Furwa, and feels that they learned a great deal from the process, although it agrees it might have been better if some things had been done differently. The company’s management is not in favour of state aid for restructuring, as they feel that it is too great a problem to identify those who really need help. They believe that it would make more sense to help those SMEs which want to restructure in areas such as expert knowledge. Restructuring can be very demanding, especially for small businesses, representing a disproportionately large burden in terms of acquiring knowledge and skills for successful implementation. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Karin Širec, Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Mihael Blažič, General Manager, Blažič robni trakovi d.o.o.</p>\r\n<p>Luka Novak, Business Quality and HR manager, Blažič robni trakovi d.o.o.</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.blazic.eu/en/index.php"">http://www.blazic.eu/en/index.php</a></p>\r\n<p><b>Secondary sources</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>brochure of the company: <i>Blažič, robin\r\ntrakovi: Company Profile.</i>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Blažič je letošnja gazela osrednje\r\nSlovenije’,<i> Dnevnik</i> No. 218, 19.09.2008.

"Boris 45, Spain"~"Boris 45"~"<p>Spanish catering company Boris 45 established an additional plant and took over the management of a distribution unit after winning a public tender for hospital catering services. In order to familiarise staff with the products for the new client and the new production processes, substantial training was offered. People in charge of each unit were trained externally and then passed on their new knowledge to the other employees in training organised by the HR department.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Boris 45 was founded in 1985 in Barcelona. Its new plant in the city of Reus (which forms the basis of this case study) was opened in August 2010.</p>\r\n<p>The main economic sector or activity in which the company operates corresponds to the NACE Rev2 code 56.2: ‘event catering and other food service activities’, aimed at specific organisations.</p>\r\n<p>The company is a family business, so all capital is owned by a single family, originally from Barcelona. The company is registered as a Public Limited Company, and its shares are all distributed among family members. One member of the family is the manager, in charge of running the daily organisation and in control of the business. The administrative board of Boris 45 comprises eight members (including the manager) with a total of six family members.</p>\r\n<p>The main production plant (the firm’s headquarters) is in Barcelona, with 70 employees (as at November 2011). The business unit in Reus has 20 employees. A new production plant (a central kitchen) was expected to be opened in 2012, next to the Reus unit, employing 10–15 people. </p>\r\n<p>The company’s market is limited largely to the region of Catalonia (mainly Barcelona and its surroundings) which is considered an urban area. </p>\r\n<p>Company growth in 2011 was expected to remain stable. The main business aims were to grow and to reach new clients and distribute food to more institutions such as hospitals, old people’s homes, and schools</p>\r\n<p>Boris 45 has a works council of five people, representing the interests of all employees,  (any Spanish company with more than 50 workers has, by law, to have a works council). Two people on the council represent the General Union of Workers (<a HREF=""http://www.ugt.es/"">UGT</a>) and three represent The Trade Union Confederation of Workers’ Commissions (<a HREF=""http://www.ccoo.es"">CCOO</a>) the main Spanish trade unions. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Boris 45 is an example of an extension of business activities in order to serve a new client in a different location. </p>\r\n<p>The main impetus for this has been the identification of a new business opportunity, based on a public tender for the new hospital of Sant Joan in Reus. This required the winning bidder to build a ‘hospital satellite unit’ in the Hospital of Sant Joan (intended for the reception and distribution of food in the hospital), and also a new production plant or ‘central kitchen’ in the industrial park of Reus. </p>\r\n<p>After being awarded the contract to manage the hospital catering services, in November 2011, Boris 45 became responsible for the ‘hospital satellite unit’. This serves as a centre point from where the food is plated and distributed to patients. However, the ‘central kitchen’ is still under construction. Hence, Boris 45 buys in cooked food from another firm, which Boris 45 arranges and distributes at its ‘hospital satellite unit’. Once the new ‘central kitchen’ is ready, the company will cook its own food to serve the hospital satellite unit, as well as other new potential clients such as other hospitals and schools. </p>\r\n<p>Boris 45 has been in charge of the new Sant Joan hospital catering services since August 2010. Reus hospital was transferred to a recently constructed building opened in December 2010. At this time Boris 45 started to work in the new ‘hospital satellite unit’. The ‘central kitchen’ was expected to open in May–June 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>All decisions concerning the planning and management of the restructuring process were taken by the company’s management board at the Barcelona headquarters, led by the general manager. The works council was not involved in the decision-making process.</p>\r\n<p>After winning the public tender, Boris 45 became responsible for managing the hospital catering services. It took over employment of the 17 staff already working in the ‘hospital satellite unit’ under another employer. Once the contract was publicly announced, workers attended a meeting where they were informed of the new company and the transfer of employees' rights and employers' obligations. Known as ‘subrogation’, this is an increasingly common phenomenon in Spain.</p>\r\n<p>As established by law, subrogation implies that all workers’ terms and conditions of employment such as salaries, length of contracts and working hours must continue as under the previous company. </p>\r\n<p>However, Boris 45 has introduced a small change in working time, with employees working an additional one and a half hours every day, so that they can have two days off per week (instead of only one). It has been possible to introduce this change only because employees approved it. In fact, the vast majority of employees wanted this change, so it was implemented from the very beginning, without discussions or negotiations. </p>\r\n<p>When Boris 45 began work at the new hospital satellite unit, three extra employees were hired, bringing the total number there to 20. They were hired under the same conditions as the other 17, that is, following the collective agreement for catering trade. </p>\r\n<p>The central kitchen under construction at Reus industrial park is expected to create 10–15 new jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Generally speaking, the expansion process has been trouble-free. Getting used to the new building and new production processes has required an adaptation period both for employees and managers. Moreover, the company has had to adapt to client requirements. One of the main challenges of opening a new plant or working with new employees is to learn about the new environment and clients. In this particular case, the business specialised in particular products for a new client, and production processes included the latest technologies, which were new to managers and employees. </p>\r\n<p>For this reason, Boris 45 made a great effort to train staff in depth, so that they could learn about the new processes and techniques. First, the person in charge of each unit/department was trained externally in specialised centres, then passing on their new knowledge to other employees at in-company training sessions organised by the Human Resources Department.</p>\r\n<p>According to managers at Boris 45, lifelong learning is essential for a good catering service. Employees receive training on four main topics: hygiene, food handling, gastronomy and safety. Working processes for the original 17 employees in the hospital satellite unit’ are now very different. The previous company carried out ‘hot line’ processes, whereas Boris 45 has installed new equipment for ‘cold line’ processes. Employees were initially doubtful about the implementation of the new processes and afraid that difficulties would arise. Some had worked in the hospital for nearly 20 years, following more or less the same processes, so learning new methods was a big change.</p>\r\n<p>However, after an adaptation and learning period, employees thought the new processes were faster and easier, and less likely to cause musculoskeletal problems. All employees have liked the company training plan, calling it thorough and wide-ranging. </p>\r\n<p>The new business activity in Sant Joan hospital required a huge investment for the company (both in the ‘hospital satellite unit’ and the ‘central kitchen’). Winning the public tender required the company to comply with conditions established by the public authority, including opening two units equipped with the latest technology. </p>\r\n<p>However, the company says there have been some problems with regard to the public tender, with initial projections varying slightly in comparison to what was finally established. This meant plans for business/growth prospects had to be modified. There were also administrative problems caused by too much red tape, and excessive administrative costs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Boris 45 has not received any kind of support, financial or otherwise for restructuring. All investments came from internal resources. In fact, managers complain that the Public Administration has not really supported them; and in fact has demanded a lot of money for taxes and administrative processes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Boris 45 has hired 17 employees who were already working at the hospital (subrogation), plus three new employees. This means an increment of 20 employees in the total staff of Boris 45.</p>\r\n<p>The future perspective seems quite gloomy. When Boris 45 won the hospital contract in August 2010, prospects were much more optimistic. However, one year later, the Regional Government of Catalonia started to cut the public health budget because of the economic crisis. Therefore, the company’s initial investments might now appear high in relation to future prospects. Cost reductions in Sant Joan hospital directly affect Boris 45 (for example, there will be fewer sick people admitted to the hospital and they will stay in hospital for a shorter period). For this reason, managers are considering dismissing one or two employees. </p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Boris 45 is currently building a new central kitchen as part of the contract. In order to make this production plant viable, Boris 45 will have to win new clients, a key business objective. If they do not, the huge investment in the new building will not be recovered.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Boris 45 managers consider that current growth prospects are not as optimistic as they were when they won the contract, especially due to public health budget cuts. Initial investments in technical equipment were relatively cautious in case things turned out to be worse than expected. </p>\r\n<p>However managers feel they risked more on personnel and hired more employees than needed. They regret not acting more cautiously on this issue as well. </p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, the interviewees think that Boris 45, as an SME, has more flexibility than larger companies. This characteristic allows them to adapt to new situations and take decisions much more quickly. They also consider that they have closer personal relations with other business providers, than large companies. This means that relations are stronger and more stable. Interestingly, these advantages are in line with small and large enterprise differences reported in the Spanish National Report. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Jessica Durán and Iñigo Isusi , Ikei</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Manager of the new plant </p>\r\n<p>Kitchen Manager (workers’ representative)</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.boris45.com"">http://www.boris45.com</a> </p>\r\n<p><b>Online newspapers</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.reusdigital.cat/index.php?command=show_news&amp;news_id=17166"">http://www.reusdigital.cat/index.php?command=show_news&amp;news_id=17166</a> </p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.hosteleriahospitalaria.org/content/boris-45-producir%C3%A1-en-reus-los-alimentos-de-quinta-gama"">http://www.hosteleriahospitalaria.org/content/boris-45-producir%C3%A1-en-reus-los-alimentos-de-quinta-gama</a> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Spain"~"56 - food and beverage service activities"~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"business expansion"~"2011-11-14"
"Construction company, Slovakia"~"Construction Company"~"<p>The economic crisis led this producer of glass blocks for the construction industry to insolvency. Slovakian legislation permits restructuring: a process whereby creditors write off part of the debt owed to them, and the debtor continues to operate in the hope of recovery. This can save a company from bankruptcy, enabling the changes required to become competitive. The company decided on this option and was able to repay its debts within one year. Bringing an external business consultancy on board was crucial for the business, helping the company assess its financial situation and the possibility of restructuring.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>This limited liability company was founded in 2001. It is located in the south-west of Slovakia, near the capital Bratislava, the most economically prosperous region in the country. The company has two owners having equal ownership shares. One of the co-owners, who has an educational background in construction and economics, is the founder and managing director of the company.</p>\r\n<p>The company started its activities in Slovakia specialising in the production of building glass and glass blocks for the construction industry. Glass bricks and glass profiles became attractive for specific architectonic constructions when technological development enhanced their technical and aesthetic characteristics. Glass block, also known as glass brick, is an architectural element made from glass and is used in areas where privacy or visual obscuration is desired while admitting light, such as underground parking garages, washrooms and staircases. It has a wide range of uses and applications in interiors and exteriors. Glass block was originally developed in the early 1900s to provide natural light in industrial factories. Currently, glass block represents an innovative technology that reduces the thermal transmittance of the classic glass block, making it possible to create architectural façades made entirely of glass blocks that promote the conservation of energy and safeguard the environment. Texture and colour variations are challenging for architectural applications.</p>\r\n<p>The company is among the most important importers and distributors of glass bricks and builders of glass profiles in the Slovakian market. It undertakes construction work for individual customers as well as large building companies. To be able to compete, the company has developed technologies and skills for laying and connecting glass bricks and glass profiles. These activities led the way for new wall installation methods and new special mortars for laying and finishing. The company also provides all necessary construction components and materials.</p>\r\n<p>Providing good customer service is important for the company and a precondition for success. This is because the general knowledge and skills surrounding the use of glass bricks and glass profiles is not yet common. </p>\r\n<p>The company imports building glass products from Italy (Vetroarredo), Germany, the Czech Republic (Vitrablok) and Poland. It distributes these products and provides services and construction works in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary and Poland. It also distributes these products to large retail chains such as BauMax and Hornbach. It has a partner company in the Czech Republic, which is registered as an independent company.</p>\r\n<p>The company does not have any relationships with trade unions nor an existing works council.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The company developed steadily over the past decade and its performance peaked in 2008. As a reaction to the boom in the construction sector, the company expanded its activities. This was due to the positive economic development in the country, where the economic growth in 2008 reached 10%. In 2007, as its markets matured, the company increased its number of employees from 6 to 14.  </p>\r\n<p>Very soon, the managing director foresaw negative trends in the construction industry. The first signs of global crisis forced the company to reconsider its strategy and change its business model. The company decided to outsource as a way of lowering personnel and operational costs more widely. This decision was made by the managing director. In 2009, the company decreased its number of permanent employees from 14 to 3 in order to be more flexible. Eleven employees were made redundant. The company followed standard procedures: the employees were given a notice period of two months and redundancy payments. According to the managing director, the employees received the news reasonably well. At the time, it was still relatively easy to find work, and new vacancies were more frequent in the labour market. The company provided references to the employees who requested them. Some of the employees established their own businesses.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, the focus of the company has changed towards close cooperation with other construction companies. The company started to develop a network of cooperating companies specialising in specific tasks and activities which were performed previously by the company itself. These companies provided know-how and materials to serve their customers. Some of them were established by the former employees. This is a common practice in Slovakia in order to eliminate the very high administrative and financial burden related to employment.</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, there was a substantial break in the market, and ever since the company has been stagnating. The current crisis caused a severe decline in the construction industry and affected some of its important cooperating companies and clients, who have not been able to pay for deliveries and services. This eventually led to the company becoming insolvent in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>When the management became aware of the company’s financial situation, it contacted a company that specialises in financing and restructuring of companies in financial difficulties. Based on the consultancies, the management decided that restructuring was a realistic option. ‘Restructuring’ (<i>reštrukturalizácia</i>) is a legal process whereby creditors, in their own interest, can write off part of their claims, and the debtor will continue operations in the hope that it recovers. This process is supervised by the court under the Act on bankruptcy and restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>During the analysis, it appeared that there was a possibility that the company could continue in operation, mainly because of existing market demands as well as good relations with suppliers and customers. The company had the option to apply for restructuring in order to avoid bankruptcy. The management started to communicate with its creditors. It was necessary to convince the main creditors that the restructuring plan was realistic and that the operating company could pay back more of its debts than yields from forced selling of company assets in bankruptcy. According to the managing director, the company had several meetings with its main creditors to explain that this option would be the most beneficial for both parties. The negotiations themselves were not difficult but, initially, there was a degree of distrust because the option of restructuring, as a legal process, was unknown to the creditors. The Act on bankruptcy and restructuring only came into effect relatively recently, in January 2006. The creditors, not familiar with this option, thought at first that they might lose all their money.  </p>\r\n<p>As with bankruptcy, both creditors and debtors can apply for restructuring, and the debtor can appoint a bankruptcy trustee (<i>správca konkurznej podstaty</i>) to assess whether restructuring is possible. The trustee is a physical or a legal person listed under the Register of Bankruptcy Trustees of the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic. The role of the trustee is to assist the courts in the process of bankruptcy and restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>The trustee in this case was appointed by creditors to assess whether the debtor met the conditions of restructuring. The assessment could not be more than 30 days old. The outcome of the assessment was a recommendation for restructuring of the debtor, which also involved the assessment of its economic status. Based on the trustee’s assessment, the request for restructuring to the relevant court was submitted. At this stage, the court reviewed the formal essentials of the submitted motion for restructuring. The ruling on commencement of restructuring process was issued on 9 November 2010. It protected the company from further moves by creditors.</p>\r\n<p>The company, in cooperation with the trustee and the committee of main creditors, developed the restructuring plan. The plan stated how, when and in what amounts the claims of eligible creditors would be covered. In addition, the plan regulated monitoring of the company operation and its financial decisions. This plan was endorsed by the court on 14 April 2011. According to the managing director, the restructuring process has gone smoothly. Under the agreement, the company was required to repay around 60%–70% of its debts. The repayment of the amounts of debt under the restructuring plan has been covered, and the plan came to an end in the spring of 2012. The restructuring was to officially end in May 2012, when it would be deleted from the commercial register. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Restructuring was a challenging process for the company and its management. It was necessary to negotiate with the committee of creditors for an optimal restructuring plan. The main aim of the debtor is to keep the company operating while the creditors are requesting the best possible repayment of their loans. Reconciliation of the two conflicting parties is necessary for the success of restructuring. The final arrangement was formally embedded in the restructuring plan. The consultancy company contributed to this outcome by properly evaluating the potential and prospects of the company. The ability to convince the creditors was important for the overall success. However, fulfilment of the restructuring plan to be realised over three years was also challenging. It imposed tough restrictions on financial operations of the company and constrained its development activities. During this time, it was very difficult to get any loan or start any activities that were considered risky.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>When the company became insolvent, the management used the services of a consultancy company that helped them assess whether the company could avoid bankruptcy and apply for restructuring. The consultancy company was instrumental in convincing creditors that restructuring was a viable option. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The outcomes of restructuring were straightforward. During the restructuring process, the debtor, bankruptcy trustee and committee of creditors negotiated the restructuring plan that would allow the company to operate and provide the best return for creditors for their financial claims in a reasonable period of time. In this case, the plan was worked out for three years, which meant three years of monitoring business activities by the main creditors and maintaining the restrictions imposed by the restructuring plan. The company paid off its debts within a year, and the creditors were satisfied with the outcome. Subsequently, the records of restructuring were to be removed from the commercial register in May 2012.</p>\r\n<p>There has not been any major change in terms of business activities; the company continues to operate as previously but maintains close relationships with its cooperating companies, which are crucial to its activities. The managing director did not report any negative impacts as a result of decreased employment numbers. These changes preceded the financial difficulties of the company and the need to apply for restructuring. The existing three employees have not been affected by the restructuring process. The option of restructuring has helped the company avoid bankruptcy.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The impact of the global economic crisis on the construction sector in Slovakia has had negative consequences for this company. In order to cut its operational costs, it had to make most of its staff redundant and outsource services to other companies. Despite these changes, the company had been stagnating since 2009. Late payments from clients eventually led to its insolvency in 2010. </p>\r\n<p>Solving the problems of a company that is in financial difficulties is always very demanding. This is especially true when there is an imminent threat of bankruptcy. Slovakian legislation provides the option of restructuring, which can save a company from bankruptcy, allowing for the necessary changes in management and production organisation in order to become competitive.</p>\r\n<p>This legislation has been in force since 1 January 2006. Despite problems, this approach is useful and is considered as a contribution to improving the business environment. However, more extensive use can bring experiences and new ideas for its improvement.</p>\r\n<p>In the present case, the company took the option to restructure and was able to repay its debts within one year. Bringing the external business consultancy on board was crucial for the business; it helped the company assess its financial situation and the possibility of restructuring. The company continues to operate as previously, but has not become more competitive as a result of restructuring. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Juraj Poledna, Peritus</p>\r\n<p>Eva Kasperova, Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>Interview with the co-owner and managing director</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Slovakia"~"46 - wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles"~"0-9"~"0-9"~"recession/crisis"~"(avoiding) bankruptcy"~"2011-12-05"
"El León, Spain"~"El León "~"<p>Spanish company El Le&oacute;n has experienced decreasing orders and sales since 2007 and reacted to that by first offering incentives for voluntary redundancies, followed by the suspension of employment contracts for 120 days, before finally deciding to carry out compulsory redundancies. This damaged the image of the firm, which had previously been a popular employer in the region. Gossip and rumours are harmful for the company's relationships with its suppliers and clients, and some people in the area even think that the company has already closed.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>El Le&oacute;n was founded in 1964, and is located in Ejea de los Caballeros, a village in the rural area of Zaragoza province. The main activity of El Le&oacute;n includes the manufacture of bucket-loaders, which corresponds to NACE Rev2 28.3 (manufacture of agricultural and forestry machinery).</p>\r\n<p>El Le&oacute;n was originally a family business set up by two owners. At present, the two founders are about to retire. One of the owners has already handed his shares to his two children and stopped working at the company; the other has started proceedings to transfer ownership to his children. Both managers and workers think the transfer is influencing management of the company, reflecting the high importance of personal decisions, as suggested by the literature review in the Spanish National Report. As of November 2011 the company has 36 employees 35 men and one woman.It is estimated that the average employee is in the middle age category.</p>\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s main market is domestic, with a small proportion of export sales. During the last five years, as a consequence of the international economic and financial crisis, sales have plummeted and the company has made huge losses. The general environment seems pretty negative, so future prospects are poor. The company directors are interested in enhancing exports, but this would mean a huge, and currently unaffordable, financial effort. Business aims are to cope with this difficult situation and survive, in the hope that conditions will get better soon. In order to maintain the business running, shareholders have had no choice but to contribute more funds to the company. Before hitting this bad patch, the company used to employ 85 and it was considered a well-established and renowned company in the area. Unfortunately, circumstances are very different these days.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, there is no works council at the company. According to Spanish legislation, designating a works council is only compulsory for companies with 50 employees or more. Therefore, given that El Le&oacute;n has only 36 employees, it is not required to elect a works council. Nevertheless, they do have personnel delegates acting as workers&rsquo; representatives.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring studied here is an internal restructuring process which took place in January 2011. During this time the management board decided to carry out a plan for the adjustment of employment levels, by which seven employees were made redundant. According to Spanish legislation, the plans for the adjustment of employment levels (<em>Expediente de Regulaci&oacute;n de Empleo</em>) can be of three different types:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>termination of working contracts (i.e. collective dismissals);</li>\r\n<li>temporary suspension of working contracts for a specific time;</li>\r\n<li>short-time working arrangements.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Following the criteria of Spanish labour law, the seven redundancies were attributed to &lsquo;objective reasons&rsquo;, given the economic loss and productivity standards of the firm, caused by the global economic crisis.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The number of orders and sales had constantly decreased since 2007. The decision to terminate the contracts was seen as the best option for the future of the company. However, it was unable to offer the seven employees any support to find a new job.</p>\r\n<p>In order to understand these redundancies, it is necessary to be aware of the delicate situation that El Le&oacute;n has undergone since 2008, characterised by a serious drop in income. Other measures were implemented before the company decided on the dismissals. Since mid-2009, the company has offered incentives to promote voluntary redundancy, which some employees have accepted. During the summer of 2010, the company arranged a plan for the adjustment of employment levels (or &lsquo;ERE&rsquo;), by which the company suspended employee contracts for a period of 120 days. It is clear that the company has been fighting the consequences of the crisis for a few years.</p>\r\n<p>Company directors and owners unilaterally decided on the redundancies; employees were not consulted, as managers felt it was the only option to maintain the business. This reflects the difficulties of social dialogue practices within Spanish small enterprises, due partly to the absence of compulsory social dialogue solutions for smaller enterprises (as suggested in the Spanish National Report).</p>\r\n<p>Conversely, the suspension plan arranged in the summer of 2010 was agreed and coordinated with employees, in order to reach a favourable accord between all stakeholders and the company. The negotiation process was not very problematic or lengthy, since everyone was willing to find a solution. At the beginning, workers&rsquo; representatives had been rather unwilling to agree to the suspension plan, but eventually accepted the bad economic situation facing the firm. Thus, it was possible to finally make a decision on a suspension plan, as a temporary solution for the good of everyone in the long term. Unfortunately, the situation did not improve and the position of the business became increasingly difficult. The management board described the 2010 sales as a &lsquo;disaster&rsquo;. In December 2010 and January 2011 management offered incentives to employees to take voluntary redundancy. However, when employees were unwilling to accept them management decided on the dismissals.</p>\r\n<p>From the point of view of the workers&rsquo; representatives, the company is in a really bad situation. They feel that the new owners are not really able to adapt to new markets, innovate or find solutions to the current situation. They think that the situation got worse when the founders transferred ownership to their children. Some workers are pessimistic and afraid that company closure will be unavoidable in the medium-term. The lack of exports is seen as one of the main problems, due to the poor prospects of the Spanish market.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>One of the challenges for management was to tell employees about the dismissals. Employers were afraid that their relationship with the workers would be damaged. However, it seems the situation was not particularly traumatic as the workers acknowledged the firm&rsquo;s difficulties.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, it is interesting to comment on the damage caused to the image of the firm. El Le&oacute;n is a long-established company and is very popular in the area (it is located in a village in a rural region) given that it has traditionally hired workers from the surrounding locality. Many employees have worked only for El Le&oacute;n and no other company.</p>\r\n<p>The difficult economic situation the firm is currently facing has led to internal restructuring with bad consequences for workers&rsquo; conditions. This situation is having a very bad impact on the company&rsquo;s image with people in the area who think the company has already closed. Gossip and rumours are harmful for the relationships between the company, its suppliers and clients.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company has not received any kind of support for restructuring. Decisions were taken internally with neither public, nor private external advice or financial assistance..</p>\r\n<p>The labour law reform carried out by the Spanish Government in September 2010 (Law 35/2010 on urgent measures for the reform of the labour market) clarified and smoothed the proceedings of the company plans for the adjustment of employment levels. This new legislation facilitated the termination of the seven working contracts. Law 35/2010 was approved in the context of strong crisis with the aim of implementing long-term reform. Some of the measures included are directly linked to the economic downturn and its consequences, so they could be seen as temporary measures. The new Spanish government was expected to introduce further labour law reform in February or March 2012 which will modify Law 35/2010.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main outcome of internal restructuring has been the dismissal of seven employees. The compensation or indemnity for these has been a huge cost to company owners who paid it as an &lsquo;extra&rsquo; amount rather than from internal funds.</p>\r\n<p>The firm&rsquo;s future does not seem very hopeful. Company directors are thinking of implementing a new employment adjustment plan, based on the temporary suspension of working contracts. This plan is conceived as a way of getting over this difficult crisis stage. Management interviewees are trying to be optimistic and hope that economic recovery at both national and European levels will start soon.</p>\r\n<p>With regard to working conditions, the work environment is quite tense. The company is operating a &lsquo;wage freeze&rsquo; due to budget cuts. Workers accept the difficult situation the company is experiencing and there have been few labour relations problems.</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, the company might also find human resource difficulties if the economic context gets better and orders and sales increase. The dismissal of employees means a loss of knowledge and experience for the company. Moreover, employees are getting used to low production levels, where working rhythms are relatively slow. If production increases, it might be difficult to make employees work in a more efficient way.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process has also caused a loss of prestige for the company.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>As to lessons learnt, the interviewee reported that one of the weak points which has led to this situation is &lsquo;arrogance&rsquo;. The company has traditionally been a popular and buoyant business, and the management board may not have been able to notice the gravity of the economic situation early enough. From a critical perspective, a more proactive working group would have reacted in advance, going after its clients and fighting to maintain its market image. An earlier reaction might have softened the current delicate situation. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to talk to a workers&rsquo; representative. The company has just 36 employees, and according to Spanish law, it is only compulsory to have a works council for companies over 50. Thus, despite our efforts, it has not been possible to reach the workers&rsquo; representative, especially due to the current delicate situation of the company.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Jessica Dur&aacute;n and I&ntilde;igo Isusi, Ikei</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>Fernando Lacarra, General Director and owner of the company</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company website</strong></p>\r\n<p>http://www.el-leon.es/</p>\r\n<p><strong>Comment </strong></p>\r\n<p>Despite the authors&rsquo; best efforts, it was not possible to interview a workers&rsquo; representative for this case study.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Secondary sources</strong></p>\r\n<p>Online newspapers:</p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/detalle/siete_despidos_empresa_leon.html"">http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/detalle/siete_despidos_empresa_leon.html</a></p>"~"Spain"~"28 - manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c."~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2011-11-02"
"Gero serviso garantija, Lithuania"~"JSC Gero serviso garantija"~"<p>The slump in the hospitality sector in Lituania in 2008 led to a sharp drop in income for restaurant business Gero serviso garantija.  The owner took over as manager and developed a restructuring plan which was based on focusing activities only in the most profitable areas. The business has managed to survive due to business optimisation and good cash flow management.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The private limited company ‘Gero serviso garantija’ (GSG) was founded in 2005. It was established by Linas Pučinskas as the main owner, with a minor part of shares owned by a trust fund. Since the beginning the company was operating in the food &amp; beverages and restaurant industry. The restaurant was opened in the historical Verkiai Manor estate which consists of a main house, botanic park, stables and outbuildings. The estate is run by the Botanic Institute, managed by the Ministry of Education. The estate is about 10km from Vilnius city centre. It is a very picturesque location, well known by local residents and a major tourist destination. </p>\r\n<p>The restaurant was open every day for visitors to the estate, while weekends were usually booked for larger events (mainly weddings). It was expected that there would be mutual benefit from the company renting the reception rooms at the historic manor hall for these events and financing the renovation needed.</p>\r\n<p>The company’s business is rather local and the only international aspect is the foreign visitors. </p>\r\n<p>The company grew from the start, up to 2007. However, in 2008 company had to review operations, and the hired management was replaced by the owner, Linas Pučinskas. </p>\r\n<p>With a background in the hospitality industry, Linas Pučinskas is involved in several different projects related to tourism. He was previously the manager of Baltpark hotel (later sold to the Holiday Inn group).</p>\r\n<p>GSG has few employees so there is no works council nor union representation in the company. There are no human resources or corporate social responsibility strategies. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Restructuring began in the second half of 2008, caused by external as well as internal factors.</p>\r\n<p>The greatest of the external forces was the crisis in the Lithuanian economy. The slump in the hospitality sector led to the sharp drop of income. The number of visitors having lunch and dinner at the restaurant decreased dramatically.</p>\r\n<p>One important internal reason was debts from rental arising from the indiscreet actions of a manager which reached  significant proportions by 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Pučinskas started to manage the company in autumn 2008. He developed a restructuring plan which had two important aspects.</p>\r\n<p>The first, and most important one, was a review of activities. As daily services were no longer profitable because of the drop in visitor numbers, the challenge was to optimise and concentrate activities only in the profitable areas. A few alternatives were considered:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>limit activities only to the servicing of contracted\r\nevents;</li>\r\n<li>limit activities only to the servicing of contracted\r\nevents and enter catering business;</li>\r\n<li>close the business.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>After evaluation of the market potential and business capabilities, it was decided to limit the business to weekend activities, mostly for weddings and some other contracted events in the historical estate only. </p>\r\n<p>Another important aspect was sorting out the problem of a negative cash flow. The owner tackled this by putting in his own money. The shrinking business and unplanned debt required an in-depth review of expenses, which showed that the biggest expense was salaries, which had to be reduced. </p>\r\n<p>The optimisation of activities and tightened cash flow management were introduced in the beginning of 2009. The biggest impact of those changes was on the salary system. Incomes were now related directly to events. A minimum, unchanging, level was offered to the 36 employees, with an extra variable amount on top directly related to the events.</p>\r\n<p>All employees were offered the chance to stay under new conditions. Employees were very understanding about the situation and management efforts to secure operations. This may have been because the new owner was honest with them. Most employees left the company because of the poor prospects; this, however, allowed the company to secure some financial resources as there was no need to pay lay-off compensation. Also this was in line with the downsizing activities. The most important employees, including the chef and the sales people, agreed to stay on. Nevertheless, only six people started activities under the new conditions in 2009.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process can be evaluated as properly planned. Examples of other businesses in similar situations clearly demonstrated that the inability to change would have led to bankruptcy. Quick reaction to changes in the market and decisive control of a cash flow allowed GSG keep afloat. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Restructuring was focused on optimisation and a major reduction in the number of employees. The main challenge was to ensure a smooth lay-off process. All employees left the company on a voluntary basis. If the company had had to pay lay-off compensation it would have faced bankruptcy.   </p>\r\n<p>Another important challenge was to ensure the company retained key people, especially the kitchen chef. This was possible because the company’s new plan to specialise was opening new opportunities.  </p>\r\n<p>GSG is anchored to a special location, so it was a challenge to secure the relationship with the tenant. Debt was increasing and tenants felt they could not work any longer with GSG. The ministry had to intervene to ensure further normal cooperation between the two parties. GSG’s flexibility and ability to understand how the tenant’s market was changing could have been better.</p>\r\n<p>And the last, but not least, there was a need for additional funding as the business was not able to generate enough income to pay all the ongoing expenditures. Banks at that period were not willing to lend any money, especially to SMEs. So the owners had to finance cash-flow shortfalls themselves. This was a significant problem for most of SMEs at this time and sometimes a main reason for business bankruptcy. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>There was no crucial advice and support from external sources except one. Sustaining the relationship with tenant was a significant challenge. Debt was increasing and the tenant was not willing to wait for the money, even though GSG was renting out estate halls and generating additional income for the tenant. If the Ministry of Education had not intervened to help GSG may not have been able to survive. The Ministry’s proper and timely actions in helping to develop a mutually compatible debt payment plan were very important.</p>\r\n<p>Planning of the restructuring and financing transition period was carried out by Linas Pučinskas with no financial or managerial support from external sources.</p>\r\n<p>Linas Pučinskas is certain that financial support for SMEs during restructuring is crucial. Banks, as commercial institutions, are not willing to support business in such a situation, especially during a crisis. Even relatively small financial resources can be vital for ensuring the survival of SMEs under these difficult sorts of conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The outcome of restructuring can be evaluated as positive because the business is still operating. The company is optimised, business is sustained and debt for the tenant is covered. Another positive result is that the reputation of Linas Pučinskas as a manager and as an active participant in hospitality industry was secured. This is personally important for him as GSG is just one of the activities in this sector that he is undertaking. </p>\r\n<p>In terms of employment, 30 full time jobs were lost, but business was sustained. The new payment system (a minimum basic plus a variable amount dependent on the work load) worked very well for those who stayed with the company. New opportunities for self-development and family life were opened, and employees’ wages have improved as the business recovers and the work load is increasing.</p>\r\n<p>There is now no strict organisational structure; functions are spread among employees, which has led to fewer internal tensions. This is very different to 2005–2008, where a vertical organisation was developing.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Linas Pučinskas feels he learned some important lessons from the restructuring. He thinks that in the case of SMEs it is very important to act decisively in response to external changes. Some SMEs try to delay acting until the last moment, which is a mistake. He adds that quick surgery is preferable to long-drawn-out suffering, with changes planned and implemented much faster than in big companies.</p>\r\n<p>In situations of rapid decline in business, it is important to relate salary payments to the cash flow and outsource all possible activities in order to reduce fixed costs. Cash flow is one of the biggest threats for SMEs in restructuring periods. State financing during those periods could be very successful in ensuring the sustainability of SMEs. </p>\r\n<p>SMEs dealing with public sector in a public-private partnership should be able to expect more flexibility from the public partner. In the fluctuating periods the position of the public institutions remains stable and business (as a less powerful participant) is left alone to weather the changes. </p>\r\n<p>However, the key to successful restructuring in SMEs remains the ability to act and implement changes very quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Edmundas Piesarskas, EKT</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interview</b></p>\r\n<p>Linas Pučinskas, Manager and owner,JSC ‘Gero serviso garantija’</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p> <a HREF=""http://www.verkiai.lt"">www.verkiai.lt</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Lithuania"~"56 - food and beverage service activities"~"10-49"~"0-9"~NULL~"internal restructuring"~"2012-01-09"
"Interactive Net Design, Hungary"~"Interactive Net Design Ktf."~"<p>Interactive Net Design, a Hungarian company producing technology for the banking and finance sector, underwent restructuring to pursue a change to its business model in the context of the economic crisis and reduced client budgets. New branch offices were opened in foreign markets, creating new jobs in target markets, but leading to the lay-off of employees at headquarters. Subsequently, the company increased its sales and marketing staff abroad, and new teams were established within the company to support its business strategy. The company made a major effort to change company culture to adapt from being a small Hungarian player to becoming an international force.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Interactive Net Design Kft. (later IND Group) was established in 1997 by three Hungarians who today comprise the top management team of a seven-level functional structure. In 2008, the founders had to give up part of their ownership in order to obtain venture capital investment, but they retained a majority influence on company decisions. With its unique ‘banking front office technology’(BFO), IND is a leading product developer and provider for the European e-finance market. The front office technology is a comprehensive range of sales and banking services  including branch, internet, mobile and contact centres, on the same centralised platform. The technology delivers high-quality customer service while optimising sales with reduced acquisition and retention costs. IND group employed approximately 145 people in 2011, including 45 independent subcontractors who work exclusively for IND Kft. </p>\r\n<p>Of the 100 people directly employed, 70 are involved in the design, programming, testing and support of the banking front office technology. Employment has fluctuated in recent years:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>2007, there were 93 employees; in 2008, 121; in 2009, 95;\r\nin 2010, 98; and in 2011, 102. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Their main functions are product development, marketing, sales, administration, office management and finance. All the technology experts have, on average, four years’ experience in delivering internet and mobile banking solutions. Their average age is 28, and 85% of them are male with higher education qualifications in software development or economics. There is no trade union or works council. At the beginning of 2009, IND bought a majority ownership stake in Simple Soft – a local competitor with six employees – and transferred all e-business clients. </p>\r\n<p>IND formed a partnership with Brokat Infosystems Ag., a major banking software developer, and subsequently acquired their e-channels business unit (and in that context also took over one of the employees) in 2003 to become a primary market player. IND has experienced remarkable growth over the past few and years in the international financial IT market. It operates in several countries (Austria, Germany, Hungary, Romania and the UK) and, through their local business partner network, they are represented in Bahrain, Dubai, Egypt, Italy, Switzerland and Ukraine. They provide proficiency and state-of-the-art technology in more than <a HREF=""http://www.indgroup.eu/ind_world/location/international_presence/index"">15 countries on three continents</a>. </p>\r\n<p>The company has achieved substantial growth, although income has fluctuated during the last three years. Income in each of the last five years has been: </p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>2007, HUF 1,454 million\r\n(€5,013,800 );</li>\r\n<li>2008, HUF 2,100 million (€7,241,000);</li>\r\n<li>2009, HUF 1,434 million (€4,945,000);</li>\r\n<li>2010, HUF 1,734 million (€5,980,000);</li>\r\n<li>2011,HUF 2,450 million (€8,448,000) (expected).\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>By 2008, 90% of the company’s income came from the e-banking business unit and 10% from small e-business projects (webpage programming and design). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In 2007, IND management changed the business model, from recruiting staff to meet specific software/application development project requirements, to develop their own ‘out of the box’ software, which can be customised for individual bank client needs by other providers. As a consequence, the pricing and income model changed too. Bank clients now pay licence fees. This required a large investment, so IND ,for the first time, acquired external capital. This was in the form of venture capital from Euroventures to invest in product development and entering new markets. This included opening an office in Bucharest office and forming a partnership with BSC Russia (2009); opening offices in Zagreb and Bratislava (2010); and opening an office in Warsaw (2011). </p>\r\n<p>In autumn 2008, IND visited all clients to introduce their new product and to map the next year’s needs. Because of the financial crisis, most clients planned budget cuts for 2009 and 2010. Banks were not planning new branch offices, focusing more on electronic sales channels and, therefore, in need of more e-applications. </p>\r\n<p>IND had three possible ways to prepare for the future, and they used all of them except one:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>cutting internal costs, increasing cost\r\nefficiency;</li>\r\n<li>searching for new markets;</li>\r\n<li>other possible sectors (telecommunication, healthcare,\r\npublic institution);</li>\r\n<li>finding new customers in foreign markets;</li>\r\n<li>getting larger share of its existing clients’\r\nbudget.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Larger firms/enterprises tend to be more inflexible and ‘froze’ in the crisis. IND, however, was prepared for restructuring, and had a long-term plan developed by senior management. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>To pursue the new strategy, new branch offices were opened in foreign markets, creating new jobs in target markets. This meant that 20% of employees, mostly software developers doing basic programming, were dismissed at headquarters. However, IND helped them to find new jobs. The company took steps to increase programming efficiency. Subsequently, they reinforced their sales and marketing staff abroad but, altogether they hired fewer people, only 10%–12% of their original number, resulting in large savings.</p>\r\n<p>They established two new functional teams in the organisation. The first was a gap analysis team. This comprised business consultants, who identified gaps between client needs and software capacity before product implementation. They specified extra functions and development needs, and ordered it from the platform team.</p>\r\n<p>The second group was the platform team, comprising software developers responsible only for product development.</p>\r\n<p>A separate R&amp;D department with ten employees, all redeployed from elsewhere was also created. This screens all innovations and trends on the markets, and ensures that IND has the latest technology in its products. Team members attend conferences, read the relevant literature and keep an eye on competitors’ developments. </p>\r\n<p>In 2009, IND increased attendance at conferences, advertised in foreign scientific journals and became more proactive, including running a sales road show in Europe and organising 150 one-on-one meetings with potential clients. As a result, the number of bank requests for information and for proposals has increased. Twenty ‘hot topics’ (potential development ideas) were collected. These ideas were presented to potential clients, to identify what those clients would buy For example, instead of expensive sms notification, they could develop ‘push alert’ for mobile application. This changed the business model. Instead of selling developer days, they started selling bespoke software for a licence fee, offering customisation as an extra service.</p>\r\n<p>They did not waste time on large impact studies, or detailed analysis. All decisions were made at management meetings, and followed by rapid execution.</p>\r\n<p>There were painful but efficient steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>dismissal of employees, quick budget cut on benefits,\r\nfocus on those employees possessing most of the company’s\r\nknowledge;</li>\r\n<li>renegotiation of fixed costs – for example,\r\nchanging mobile operator, other suppliers;</li>\r\n<li>cut overheads (administration and back\r\noffice);</li>\r\n<li>increase trips to sales meetings;</li>\r\n<li>invest in foreign offices.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>IND was aware that it was very difficult to increase its share of the Hungarian market as the domestic financial market was shrinking fast. Therefore, they reduced their domestic operational budget. During the process, they faced a choice of: </p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>entering other sectors using their competitive advantage\r\nin R&amp;D;</li>\r\n<li>continuing to focus on their core activity and enter\r\nforeign markets. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Management decided to keep core people and exploit new opportunities, but their plan B in case of failure, was to retain 20 people capable of rebuilding the company from scratch within a year.</p>\r\n<p>In 2010, production support was further cut back while marketing and sales were increased. The marketing department grew from one to five people and became more professional, for example, preparing product marketing documentation and website development. </p>\r\n<p>Negative impacts of restructuring meant a benefits freeze for all staff for 2009, and in 2010, all sales bonuses were cut. Despite the restrictions, they pushed employees to take on increased workload and responsibility, in order to reach international standard. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenge was to encourage employees to believe in the future of the company. Employees were aware of the sales decline and dismissals and were worried about job security. In order to be able to participate in international projects, employees were expected to travel more and to be more fluent in foreign languages, so training sessions were offered by the company.</p>\r\n<p>Management felt constrained by the company culture in trying to adapt from being a small Hungarian player to becoming an international force. The best tool to effect cultural change was intensive internal communication. The founder, Balázs Vinnai, introduced quarterly meetings for employees, to inform them of prior achievements and future plans. A monthly newsletter was also introduced, to allay employee worries. These measures convinced employees they were able to compete at the international level. </p>\r\n<p>A trainer was hired to encourage employees to change the company culture over one year. Team building and internal communication training took place outside the company. Management looked closely at whether employees were spending enough time on their duties, and discovered that although most employees believed they worked long hours, they actually worked fewer than 40 hours a week. Managers also believed employees should take more responsibility for the company and the products. This was difficult to achieve as workers had been used to working in an isolated way, and blaming colleagues rather than helping each other solve problems. Training helped everybody accept responsibility. Management also emphasised product quality as the top priority, in order to distinguish the company from competitors. IND’s products were no longer the cheapest, but expected to be among the best. Management also wanted the company to be more innovative and adopt the latest technology faster. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The owners and managers also looked at their own personal development, by reading international business literature, and books on coping with crises. The company also used internal support for change management.</p>\r\n<p>The key success factor was good internal communications and high employee motivation to take responsibility. Following the introduction of these cultural changes, employees switched from a position of resistance to being strong supporters of restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>The resultant success has led to management predicting that they will be taking on at least 50 new workers in the next three years. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was planned and well-managed. Early on, the founders recognised the market trends. They did not hesitate to change their business model completely from quantitative to qualitative growth. Instead of hiring new employees and charging their time to clients, IND Kft developed a product generating higher added value. This bespoke software product is more of a solution (such as SAP) than a daily billed software development service. </p>\r\n<p>IND reached their goal of getting the company back into growth in 2011. Although the company is more vulnerable today by focusing on a niche market, they are also less at risk because of geographical expansion. Despite the large number of organisational levels, they remain a fast-reacting medium-size company.</p>\r\n<p>Investment in software has enabled IND to become a market leader worldwide. Product quality has improved substantially and quality control has worked well. Now they can negotiate with any large international bank, but now they must compete with large international competitors. Forrester Research, one of the world’s largest research companies, has, in a recent survey, included IND Group among the global players.</p>\r\n<p>The focus has shifted towards international sales. For IND, the goal is to conquer the most advanced financial institution markets. Rapid growth in 2011 offered new opportunities. At the Finovate 2011 conference in New York – a unique conference series showcasing financial and banking technology innovations – the company introduced two new applications.

"Liturimex viešbučiai, Lithuania"~"Liturimex viešbučiai"~"<p>A Lithuanian company operating in hotels and catering ran into trouble when having to guarantee bank loans, outstanding money and the economic crisis coincided. A court appointed a new administrator to try and save the company. All employees lost their jobs but many were subsequently rehired.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Liturimex viešbučiai was established in 1996 as private limited company in the hospitality sector. It owns a hotel and a guest house in the resort of Druskininkai. The company is now a ‘restructuring joint stock company’ because of a court decision. This means it is restricted in transferring the assets and has an obligation to pay off all approved liabilities, but in other actions and transfers may act as other joint stock companies. After the company fulfils its legal obligations and the restructuring period is over, it can claim the status of a joint stock company. The company is based in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius.</p>\r\n<p>The main activity of Company is the hospitality business (hotel, including provision of conference services, and restaurant). According to the approved restructuring plan, the company does not intend to change its business profile. </p>\r\n<p>The company has two buildings in Druskininkai – the Regina hotel which has 40 rooms, a restaurant and two conference halls, and a guest house with 11 rooms. Both are in the centre of the resort close to the main attractions such as an aqua park, biking, walk and riding paths, a forest park, spa, and snow skiing/snowboarding arena. The three-star hotel was the first in the town to meet European standards for hotels and kept this status until 2004. </p>\r\n<p>Druskininkai is one of Lithuania’s four main resorts, about 130 km from Vilnius and very close to the Polish and Belorussian borders. The resort is a spa town, offering mineral baths, mud and climate therapies. It is becoming an international all-year round resort: the share of foreign tourists is increasing every year, that is, from 27% in 2007 to 41% in 2011. However the share of local and national tourists has decreased. </p>\r\n<p>This trend is reflected in the register of the hotel: in 2009, about half the guests were foreign tourists whereas in 2011 this share had risen to two thirds. The company has an international presence, with sales to foreign tourists counting as exports. The nationality of the hotel guests is also changing. During 2009–2011 there was a significant increase in the number of tourists from Poland, Russia, Belorussia, with a slow increase in the number of tourists from Germany and the UK while the number of tourists from Latvia and Israel remained almost the same. Indeed, the tourists from Poland, Russia, and Belorussia helped to balance out the effect of the financial crisis, which was at its peak in the hotel business in 2010. About three quarters of Lithuanians staying at the hotel come from Vilnius and Kaunas (the country’s second city) while those living close to Druskininkai are very rare.</p>\r\n<p>The company is a part of a larger organisation, of other hospitality sector companies, such as a travel agency, car rental business and guest house. </p>\r\n<p>The company’s main shareholder, before restructuring, was Rimvydas Aniulis who, together with a manager, was involved in running the business on a daily basis. During the restructuring process he became a creditor, when the shares were sold to Liturimex grupė and to another person (who remains anonymous, by law). In January 2012, the main shareholders were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>private company Liturimex grupė (77.35% of the\r\nshares);</li>\r\n<li>private company ‘Liturimex’\r\n(9.4%)</li>\r\n<li>private company SRTP (9% );</li>\r\n<li>an anonymous person, not Rimvydas Aniulis,\r\n(4%)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The previous main shareholder still has some shares in other private companies – in ‘Liturimex grupė’ and ‘Liturimex kelionių agentūra’ (the travel agency) which is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, but Liturimex viešbučiai is still operating and has good prospects for a successful exit from restructuring and for future development. It is run by a board of three people, chaired by Rimvydas Aniulis (now a creditor) and has enough power to influence the restructuring. It and the group of its indirectly related companies together comply with definition of SME (in terms of turnover, assets, number of employees, including share or managing rights in other companies) and had less than 100 employees before restructuring started. However, before restructuring, the companies were not legally seen as a group or holding: they were connected simply by having the same shareholder.</p>\r\n<p>Business increased for Liturimex viešbučiai after 2001 with significant growth during 2006–2007. There was a drop in sales in 2008–2009 and although there was slow growth in sales in 2011 (LTA 2.1 million, about € 0.61 million), it was slightly more than forecast in the restructuring plan. </p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of 2009 the company had 42 employees, but when it got into difficulties all of them had to be dismissed under a court-approved restructuring plan, although all were paid compensation, according to restructuring law. After that only three previous employees were rehired (the chief accountant, administrator in reception and one employee). A new manager was hired, however during restructuring the reception administrator and the employee were dismissed and in January of 2012 only the manager and accountant were employed in the company. </p>\r\n<p>Before restructuring about 20% of employees had high or higher education and were able to speak two or more foreign languages, with the rest of the employees having secondary, professional or special education. About two thirds of employees were women. Almost all employees were local.</p>\r\n<p>After restructuring, the management of the hotel and restaurant were taken over by an operator company, approved by the creditors board. This operating company has rehired about 60% of the previous employees. The qualifications and experience of the current employees are good and appropriate for the current activities. </p>\r\n<p>Due to the low number of employees before restructuring there was no work council or trade union presence in the company. There were no special strategies for human resources, or corporate social responsibility. There was only a verbal commitment of being honest to all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In 2004, the company decided to extend and modernise the hotel, and it applied for EU structural funds assistance (grant up to 50%). The applicant also put up some own finance, for which the company approached a bank for loan. The bank agreed to a loan, to be issued after the company signed the EU contract. The company went ahead with the modernisation, but after signing the EU contract the bank decided not to advance the cash, as had been agreed. Furthermore, it asked the company to pay a previous loan before its original deadline. This meant the company would have to complete the project by using its own resources – using all its working capital. </p>\r\n<p>However, the company was also a guarantor of loans to the other related companies. When the economic crisis started in 2008, sales plummeted in all the companies which led to them having problems with repayment. This meant the company became responsible for a few loans, at a point when the occupancy rate in the hotel Regina was beginning to fall. </p>\r\n<p>This difficult financial situation for the company was worsened by a 5% increase in VAT, to 21%. The company started to run out of working capital; its cash flow from sales decreased, which led to debts to creditors, employees, suppliers, the tax inspectorate and, crucially, the state social security fund. When the company failed to pay its social security contributions in time, all accounts of the Company was frozen and company’s activities. Because a part of the Company’s liabilities was overdue, creditors applied to the Court. Therefore the Company has no possibility to continue the main activities (related to hospitality business) and pay off to creditors, shareholders of the Company and related companies. According to the Restructuring Law of Lithuania creditors have initiated a restructuring case at the Court in 2009. This is a typical example of internal and formal (with proceedings in the Court) restructuring type.</p>\r\n<p>Vilnius District Court ruled that the restructuring case for the company should proceed while the other related company (travel agency) should face bankruptcy proceedings. No action was taken on another related company, Liturimex grupė, which was operating successfully.</p>\r\n<p>The external drivers of restructuring were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>the economic crisis in Europe (which affected foreign\r\ntourists) and in Lithuania (which discouraged national tourists);</li>\r\n<li>inadequate regulation of banking sector and unfair\r\nbehaviour of banks;</li>\r\n<li>suddenly increased taxation;</li>\r\n<li>adverse affect of the actions of state\r\ninstitutions.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Internal causes were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>the mismanagement of cash flows;</li>\r\n<li>too high liabilities;</li>\r\n<li>under-evaluation of possible risks. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The impact of external factors was deeper than that of the internal factors and couldn’t be controlled. The changes in business environment (under-regulation of the banking sector, increasing taxes, actions or inaction of state institutions) affected the company not only directly, but indirectly too, as other people and companies facing some or all of the same problems could not use the company’ services any more. The effect of the economic crisis is visible in the nationality of the guests: since 2009 the share of tourists from Poland, Russia and Belorussia, which had been little affected by the crisis, were increasing.</p>\r\n<p>The internal causes could not be explained only by a lack of managerial ability. The owner and managers had long experience in hospitality, and the company had operated successfully for many years. Expanding too fast and over-extending business development is still very risky in Lithuania. Lack of the ability to plan long-term was the main internal cause of the restructuring, rather than lack of managerial capacities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The company began its restructuring before it was formally ordered to do so by the court. As its financial difficulties mounted after 2008, the company’s shareholders (the main shareholder and small shareholder) started to consider restructuring as possible option to save the company together with selling some shares to other investors. In order to make up for the lost bank loan two new shareholders (Liturimex and SRTP) came into the company. Legal advice was taken and in February 2009 shareholders agreed on restructuring if insolvency problems arose. They also considered inviting the participation of other financial institutions, but this option could not be realised due to later events.</p>\r\n<p>However, the situation then worsened very suddenly in the other related companies and the company, as guarantor for their loans became responsible for paying their debts. The bank announced that it intended to take over all the businesses, including the company, using bankruptcy proceedings. At this point the shareholders decided to start restructuring proceedings immediately for the company and undergo bankruptcy proceedings with the other companies. </p>\r\n<p>A written four-year plan for restructuring was prepared with the participation of the company’s shareholders, board members, creditors, lawyers and consultants. It was submitted to the court in Vilnius for formal approval at the end of 2009. </p>\r\n<p>A restructuring administrator was appointed. A company management body, with a general manager, was given the task of supervising the plan’s implementation with mandatory accounting to an assembly of creditors. The court gave its final approval of the plan on 4 February 2010.</p>\r\n<p>The plan’s objectives were to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>repay all the creditors according to\r\nschedule;</li>\r\n<li>save and continue the business;</li>\r\n<li> avoid bankruptcy;</li>\r\n<li>restore long-term solvency of the Company and its ability\r\nto fulfil liabilities to creditor</li>\r\n<li>save existing jobs;</li>\r\n<li>reorganise the company, putting it back into\r\nprofit;</li>\r\n<li>restore and increase the value of the\r\ncompany and earn higher profit in future.</li>\r\n<li>indicative duration of the restructuring plan was four\r\nyears after its approval with the possibility to complete earlier if all debts\r\nto creditors and liabilities were fulfilled before deadline. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In order to restore solvency the creditors’ claims were approved, business was maintained, money owing to it was chased up, and some assets were sold. Although the plan foresees the company paying off its debts through business activities, it also allows for the company’s debts to be paid, in the event of the plan failing, by selling the guest house.</p>\r\n<p>Running the hotel and the restaurant were divided into the separate activities and transferred to an operating company in 2010. The restaurant operating contract lasts until 1 September of 2013, and the hotel operating contract, including the provision of conference services, finishes on 15 September of 2015. Restaurant and hotel operators will pay fixed amounts to the company every month and act on their own risk and at their own expense. The income goes towards paying off debts and other liabilities. The company still disposes the asset (based on reverse leasing contract with bank), used in the restaurant and hotel operation. It also runs the accommodation at the guest house (although reservations go through the hotel).</p>\r\n<p>A special reverse leasing agreement was signed in 2010. This meant the hotel and restaurant buildings were sold to a bank and then leased back to the company. Income from this was used to pay creditors. Recovery could be realised more quickly by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>finding a purchaser for the estate;</li>\r\n<li>refinancing;</li>\r\n<li>attracting other financial institutions or strategic\r\ninvestor.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Finding an investor might be quite easy if the global economy stabilises because the company is still very attractive. It is in a favourable location (in the centre of resort and the resort is rapidly developing), has a well developed business, loyal clients, and a stable income. However, finding a financial institution might not be so easy, due to a tightening of requirements in the finance sector.</p>\r\n<p>The payment of the debts in the restructuring plan is distributed (by law) according to categories of creditors:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>first tier, employees; </li>\r\n<li>second, tier, creditors with mortgaged debts and the\r\nState Social Security fund; </li>\r\n<li>third tier, other creditors. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The debts are shared between:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>a bank (59.03%);</li>\r\n<li>shareholders (36.08%);</li>\r\n<li>suppliers (3.29%);</li>\r\n<li>State Social Security fund (1.58%);</li>\r\n<li>employees (0.01%). </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Debts to employees have been paid and the second tier is now being dealt with. </p>\r\n<p>The payments to creditors were scheduled over the four years of restructuring:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>year one, 54.07% of debts;</li>\r\n<li>year two (18.45%);</li>\r\n<li>year three (27.48%);</li>\r\n<li>year four (0 %).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Although the plan envisages the debts paid off before year four, the duration of the plan was approved by the court, and the contract with the hotel and restaurant operators will still be running when the restructuring period ends on 1 September, 2013.</p>\r\n<p>The plan meant that all 42 employees were dismissed. Only three were rehired, plus a new general manager. In 2012 the company had only two employees (manager and chief accountant). Because there was no work council or union representation there was no consultation during restructuring with any of the employees. However, some information and explanation were given to employees at meetings. Under the terms of restructuring law warning notices about the dismissals were sent to them. Generally they were given two months’ notice, although parents with two or more children under 12, and people close to retirement got four months’ notice. The new operators of the restaurant and hotel had to agree to hire at least 60% of the hotel’s previous employees.</p>\r\n<p>A fund for salaries of employees was established, and will be used until the end of 2013 (or until all debts are paid, whichever is earlier). The fund has a fixed annual growth. During the first year of restructuring it will grow by 15%, and then by 25% of its original amount every subsequent year. There is also an opportunity for bonuses for meeting sales targets. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring period can be counted from the date of shareholders’ decision for restructuring (4 February 2009) or from date of decision of the court to start the restructuring case (11 November 2009). The final date would be 1 September 2013 or the date when all liabilities to creditors will be fulfilled, whichever is earlier. The final date of the restaurant operation (15 September 2015) has also to be taken into account, after which the company will be able to carry out all the business related to the hotel, restaurant and guest house. </p>\r\n<p>In 2011 there were higher incomes than expected from the hotel, restaurant and accommodation at the guest house, which suggests that restructuring could finish earlier than planned. Nevertheless, the uncertain situation in the global economy still has to be taken into account, as well as in the company’s European export markets (Poland, Germany and the UK). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenges were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>dealing with the banks in court to try to avoid the\r\nbankruptcy proceedings;</li>\r\n<li>getting court approval for restructuring;</li>\r\n<li>finding operators for the hotel and\r\nrestaurant;</li>\r\n<li>getting the operators to rehire at least 60% of\r\nemployees;</li>\r\n<li>saving the business.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The company needed a lot of legal assistance to withstand the bank’s pressure and intimidation and to act fast against the bank in court proceedings by submitting a great deal of documentation.</p>\r\n<p>The search for people to run the hotel and restaurant was a huge challenge due to the economic crisis, however, specialist consultants were used and favourable contracts were signed. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company paid for the preparation of the restructuring plan and the restructuring process including the redundancy money, and fees for lawyers and consultants. The company and shareholders paid for the court costs, which were significant. No external financial or non-financial support was received either from state, municipal or other public funds or from private institutions such as banks or business associations. Moreover, the State Social Security Fund froze all the company’s accounts and paralysed all activities which could have contributed to paying debts.</p>\r\n<p>While planning the restructuring, and during the restructuring process, lawyers and consultants gave advice to shareholders, including the company board, and later to creditors too. These services were paid for by the shareholders; their costs were relatively low and effectiveness of such services could be assessed as very high.</p>\r\n<p>The important role of the shareholders should also be stressed – they were actively involved in finding possible solutions. Their long-term experience in the hotel business, and knowledge of business diversification (such as the hotel travel agency and car rental) and membership of a business association helped them be realistic in:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>evaluating the situation;</li>\r\n<li>coming up with two possible solutions;</li>\r\n<li>considering and planning restructuring.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The court proceedings were fair and helped to save the business, but also ensured its good prospects after the completion of restructuring. The case took a relatively short time to be decided, with the restructuring plan being implemented in 2010. </p>\r\n<p>Lithuanian law does not take into account the need for SMEs to have financial support during restructuring, when the small cost of subsidising redundancy pay, or retraining, or helping employees to find new jobs would be welcome. People can apply for financial support or training at the Labour Exchange only after dismissal. This upset and frustrated the company’s employees, whose financial situation was hit by the lengthy restructuring period, unpleasant dismissal procedure and uncertain future.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main outcome is that the business has been saved from bankruptcy and has good prospects. The first stage of restructuring is on course to be completed successfully.</p>\r\n<p>Another outcome is the two contracts with the hotel and restaurant operators, which provide the company with a stable cash flow. </p>\r\n<p>The employees’ first reaction to the restructuring announcement was negative, especially in the case of employees, who had worked at the hotel for many years and had contributed to the family atmosphere by having close and friendly relations with guests who returned every year. Despite getting redundancy pay, many employees were upset by the company’s difficult situation. </p>\r\n<p>However there was a positive outcome in that about 60% of the employees were given jobs by the restaurant and hotel operators. Another 10%–15% of employees found similar jobs elsewhere in Druskininkai. Unfortunately, about 25%–30% of employees did not find a job in the resort and have emigrated.</p>\r\n<p>Another outcome is the salaries fund, which has special terms for fixed annual growth, and a possibility of bonuses for achieving sales targets. </p>\r\n<p>No human resource strategy is foreseen until after the restructuring process is completed.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, restructuring has more positive outcomes than negative ones. The business is saved, the company is on its way to solving its debt problems, and some previous employees are still working in the same hotel, restaurant and guest house, and there are good prospects for future development and job creation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>There are a number of important differences between restructuring in SMEs and restructuring in large organisations.</p>\r\n<p>Large companies have more power in negotiating with banks or other creditors, have more managerial and planning capacities and experience, and therefore they make fewer and smaller mistakes. Large companies are also less sensitive to changes in the business environment, such as changes in taxation or the introduction of new legal requirements. </p>\r\n<p>However, large companies could be affected more by the economic crisis due to higher total operating costs. Also, when larger companies downsize the effect on unemployment is higher. Sometimes a large company is the only significant employer in a small town.</p>\r\n<p>Large companies depend less on public investments because they have their own resources to pay for new facilities. In the hotel’s case there was no public information about the town’s plans for investing in a huge spa complex. If the company had known about these, it would not have invested unnecessarily in such facilities itself. This information was kept secret by the municipality, but the situation has improved since 2007, because all public investment programmes have now to be published.</p>\r\n<p>Large companies have more resources (managerial and financial) to plan restructuring and can call on additional external resources if needed. Therefore they can implement and manage restructuring better than SMEs. As a result, many larger companies are more able to adapt to a changing environment, for example, splitting a restructuring plan into a few stages or postponing some actions, and they have more flexibility to deal early with crises and to dismiss employees step by step. An SME usually has no external support, although the company did use paid external lawyers and, advisors. Large companies can also apply for financial support for retraining during the dismissal process.</p>\r\n<p>Trade unions or work councils can play an important role in the restructuring of large companies. However, sometimes their intervention has negative effects due to groundless claims or the protraction of restructuring, which may lead to bankruptcy. Trade unions and work councils are much less common in SMEs.</p>\r\n<p>In this case study, the absence of a trade union or works council does not appear to have damaged the employees’ interests. However, their absence meant the company did not need to negotiate terms, allowing it instead immediately to begin restructuring when the situation became complicated. This enabled the company to save the business and a lot of jobs.</p>\r\n<p>Employees were informed in proper time and in writing, the terms of dismissal complied with restructuring law, and all compensation was paid. The fixed annual salary fund was not required by law. </p>\r\n<p>This company’s experience demonstrated a need for advisory support. The company’s use of legal and other consultants’ advice was atypical for SMEs, but contributed greatly to successful restructuring. The respondent would advise the use of such services despite costs, which are relatively low.</p>\r\n<p>This kind of support is needed because of weaknesses in the regulation of the banking sector, which enabled a bank to treat an SME unfairly with uneven contracting and negotiation power. Publically supported advisory services for SMEs in planning, managing cash flows, and risk assessments could help prevent many mistakes and consequent bankruptcies or restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>The inadequate behaviour of state institutions when SMEs are facing difficulties (such as freezing accounts) paralysed the company’s behaviour. This kind of behaviour must change, if SMEs are to make a full contribution to economic development. This includes providing advisory support for SMEs interested in accessing EU structural funds. State institutions do not seem interested in the success of SMEs’ projects. Also, mistakes by public officials cannot be changed, whatever a court decides. The decision by the State Social Security Fund to freeze the company’s account was illogical and contributed to the company’s difficulties. This kind of attitude in state institutions should be eliminated as part of a package of measures to improve the business environment in Lithuania.</p>\r\n<p>The legal regulation of the restructuring process could also be improved by simplifying and shortening procedures, banning the freezing of accounts of companies in difficulties, and by eliminating the requirement to dismiss all employees during restructuring while the dismissal of just some would be enough.</p>\r\n<p>The respondent in this study has identified these major success factors in restructuring:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>a realistic understanding of the situation;</li>\r\n<li>consensus among shareholders;</li>\r\n<li>timely advice from lawyers and other consultants;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>immediate reaction to the situation with a clear and\r\nrealistic restructuring plan;</li>\r\n<li>court proceedings strengthened the company’s\r\nnegotiating position with banks;</li>\r\n<li>attractiveness of the business. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In future the company will plan any extensions and business development more carefully, assessing all possible risks, and formulating measures to manage those identified. The EU structural funds support brought unexpected complications, with requirements to fulfil public procurement rules (normally not applicable to companies), extra requirements introduced during the implementation of the project, and a different interpretation of whether obligations had been fulfilled.</p>\r\n<p>The liabilities to the bank of all the related companies were too high, and in future the role of the company as guarantor for loans to the other companies should be considered more carefully. Any decision to act as guarantor should take into account the company’s abilities to continue to operate effectively if the other companies experience difficulties.</p>\r\n<p>In another similar situation, shareholders agree they would repeat all the actions taken in the restructuring process, just earlier and faster. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Danguolė Saldžiūnienė, EKT.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interview</b></p>\r\n<p>Rimvydas Aniulis, creditor (previous owner of the company), </p>\r\n<p><b>Secondary sources</b> (in Lithuanian only)</p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://archyvas.vz.lt/index.php?ss=&amp;kid=8045&amp;sa=1&amp;sp=1&amp;st=2&amp;s=Liturimex"">http://archyvas.vz.lt/index.php?ss=&amp;kid=8045&amp;sa=1&amp;sp=1&amp;st=2&amp;s=Liturimex</a> , <a HREF=""http://www.visalietuva.lt/imones/info/liturimex-viesbuciai-uab?ip=3"">http://www.visalietuva.lt/imones/info/liturimex-viesbuciai-uab?ip=3</a></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.bankrotodep.lt/Company.php?Tipas=2&amp;Code=122746612&amp;Byla=115"">http://www.bankrotodep.lt/Company.php?Tipas=2&amp;Code=122746612&amp;Byla=115</a> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Lithuania"~"56 - food and beverage service activities"~"10-49"~"0-9"~NULL~"internal restructuring"~"2012-01-16"
"Manufacturing Company, Spain"~"Manufacturing company"~"<p>This family-owned Spanish manufacturing company ran into trouble due to complete fall in demand during 2009. Temporary stoppages were agreed with the works council but when ten employees were dismissed unilaterally after negotiations failed, it resulted in a strike. The company has recovered through expansion overseas.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The company was founded in 1943 in the city of Eibar, in a traditional industrialised area of the Gipuzkoa region (industry, especially metalworking such as the manufacture of machine tools, is the most important economic sector in the area)</p>\r\n<p>The company began as a small family enterprise. Three associated members founded the company: two members from one family and the third member from another family. Nowadays, the company is still 100% owned by members of the two families, and there are members of these families among the six people on the management board.</p>\r\n<p>The company produces machinery for the production and use of mechanical power (including internal combustion engines, steam, gas, wind and hydraulic turbines, pumps, compressors, taps, valves, bearings and transmission equipment) (NACE Rev2 28.1,).</p>\r\n<p>In 2009&ndash;2010 the company also opened two new assembly plants in Brazil (Itupeva, S&atilde;o Paulo) and in China (Wujiang, Shanghai). These new plants are majority-owned by members of the two families, with a minority stake owned by domestic nationals, as required by the law of the destination countries.</p>\r\n<p>The company employs approximately 85 employees at the headquarters in Eibar and a further 10 in China and 5 in Brazil. In Eibar, most employees are men, especially in technical/production areas.</p>\r\n<p>The company began to target the global marketplaces In the 1980s, it started to sell abroad and opened its first international sales offices. The decision to open assembly plants abroad was taken in 2008-2009, as a consequence of the international economic crisis, which had really harmful consequences for the Spanish market.</p>\r\n<p>Members from the management board said company income was relatively stable until 2008, when orders and sales decreased dramatically. The downward trend continued in 2009, but fortunately, from 2010 onwards, company results have steadily increased. Indeed, it is estimated that performance in 2011 is even better than expected.</p>\r\n<p>Looking to the future, the company is working on ambitious projects in research and development, sales and service areas, in order to promote growth in national and international markets. Their plan is expected to lead to:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>the launch of major product improvements.</li>\r\n<li>reinforcement of technical and production capacities.</li>\r\n<li>the expansion of sales and service network (especially spare parts and after-sales services)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>They also plan to open a new research and development plant in Eibar, as well as a new assembly plant in India.</p>\r\n<p>The Eibar factory has a works council of nine workers. These workers actively represent two trade unions: the Trade Union Confederation of Workers&rsquo; Commissions (<a href=""http://www.ccoo.es/"">CCOO</a>) and the Nationalist Workers' Committees (<a href=""http://www.labsindikatua.org/lab/nor"">LAB</a>) a Basque nationalist trade union. Unfortunately, the relationship between the management board and the works council is very delicate, with the parties taking up quite different positions/opinions. Managers suggest the works council is not representing employee needs/requirements adequately.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>During 2008, the company was badly hit by the international economic crisis. The workload progressively decreased, and in March 2009, there were no more work orders to keep the company working. The situation was really dramatic and as a consequence, an internal restructuring plan had to be applied.</p>\r\n<p>Following Spanish labour legislation, the management board presented a plan to adjust employment levels. This &lsquo;ERE&rsquo; (<em>Expediente de Regulaci&oacute;n de Empleo</em>) can be of three types:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>collective dismissals;</li>\r\n<li>suspension of working contracts for a specific period;</li>\r\n<li>short-time working arrangements.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In this particular case, after a tough negotiations, the works council and the management board finally agreed on the second option; temporary adjustment of employment (which, following the administrative processes, was subsequently approved by the Labour Authority). This temporary suspension plan lasted from April to October 2009.</p>\r\n<p>However as the economic situation did not improve, the management board decided to present a new employment adjustment plan. This was again primarily for temporary suspension, but it also included 15 redundancies. In September 2009, talks between social partners started. After four months of negotiations, there was a renewed agreement on temporary suspensions, but the works council would not accept any dismissals.</p>\r\n<p>It was not possible, therefore, for the management board and works council to reach a consensus. Because an agreement was not signed, the company was unable to present a plan for the 15 dismissals under ERE procedures, so the process was not supported by the public authority. However, extending the temporary suspensions was agreed and approved, and therefore applied.</p>\r\n<p>Although there was no agreement with workers&rsquo; representatives concerning dismissals, in January 2010 ten workers were dismissed (five fewer than the initial proposal). This decision was taken unilaterally by the management board, and was not approved under ERE, so the company had to bear all of the costs and consequences. These included a 32-day strike by the employees.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, the company envisaged a business expansion process, consisting mainly of internationalisation in China and Brazil. The main reason for this was to increase sales by promoting international markets, given the stagnation of the Spanish market. The firm&rsquo;s very active strategy in the international domain contributed to its survival and its capacity to compete internationally (in line with the organisational effects derived from internationalisation activities identified in the Spanish National Report).</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The company decided to apply an internal reorganisation process and to search for more clients in global markets because of the economic crisis and the narrowness of the Spanish market.</p>\r\n<p>The internal restructuring was very traumatic. The company management were determined to overcome a very difficult economic situation (especially during 2009). However, given the delicate situation of the company and its huge losses, reaching a consensus with the works council was not easy at all.</p>\r\n<p>The first temporary suspensions, approved in April 2009, and lasting six months, affected most of the workers in Eibar. More precisely, each day, 50 employees had to stay at home. Following Spanish legislation, the suspended employees received the equivalent proportional part of their unemployment benefit from public funds (in order to compensate for lower salaries for working fewer hours). This temporary suspension plan lasted for approximately six months (until October 2009).</p>\r\n<p>Even under the employment adjustment plan (temporary suspension), monthly salaries were kept at the same level (including the public unemployment benefit). In this respect, the collective agreement for the metal sector was thoroughly followed, and, as legally established, salaries increased in line with the consumer price index. Working hours were reduced as agreed between managers and workers&rsquo; representatives. This agreement was approved by the Labour Authority. As this time-reduction was officially approved, there was no way the company could modify it.</p>\r\n<p>However, the termination of 10 contracts in October 2009 was not agreed to by workers. It led to a 32-day strike (from January to February 2010) and seriously undermined, and still affects the relationship between both sides..</p>\r\n<p>After the strike, employees went back to their jobs, and as can be expected, the work environment was very tense. However, this dissipated gradually, thanks to efforts made by managers and workers&rsquo; representatives to create a better environment, for example through &lsquo;informal conversations&rsquo;. Moreover, fortunately, business activity began to recover. Some workers still feel the tension, even if it can be said that &lsquo;social peace&rsquo; and &lsquo;normal business activity&rsquo; were reached several months ago. This is interesting since it shows that although the Spanish National Report and the &lsquo;El Leon&rsquo; case study seem to support the idea that SMEs have a better working atmosphere, this is not a general rule for all SMEs. Sometimes this positive environment may quickly erode if the economic situation worsens.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, in their efforts to find a solution for the lack of orders in 2009, the management board felt they had no choice but to opt for expansion into international markets outside their traditional customer base in Spain and Latin America.</p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of 2009, some members of the management board went to research business opportunities in countries including China, Brazil, USA, and France. They concluded that the best option would be to open two new assembly plants in China and Brazil, because of the large potential demand and great opportunities to find new clients in those areas. They felt that manufacturing complete products in the Eibar factory was not really competitive: a real presence in those countries was required. By the summer of 2009, the two projects were launched.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main difficulty for managers in restructuring was reaching an agreement with workers. According to the managers interviewed, they tried to build consensus with workers&rsquo; representatives, in order to make the restructuring process as smooth as possible, but feel disappointed with the works council. The management board considers that workers&rsquo; representatives incorrectly defined the internationalisation process as a &lsquo;delocalisation process&rsquo;, especially during negotiations for the second employment adjustment plan. They feel workers&rsquo; representatives tried to undermine the social image of the company, as a consequence of the temporary suspensions of working contracts and the dismissals.</p>\r\n<p>Nonetheless, it seems that workers&rsquo; representatives now recognise that, to a certain extent, the current workload in the Eibar factory exists thanks to the internationalisation process, the subsequent enlargement of its customer base and the increase in sales. All of the company&rsquo;s compressors are machined and assembled at Eibar; Brazil and China are only assembly plants.</p>\r\n<p>The problems and challenges experienced were typical of any company opening a plant in Brazil or China. Barriers included understanding tax and duty policies, and cultural differences. To overcome initial problems, they contracted a local consultancy firm to obtain all of the required information and support regarding the issues such as local/regional business culture, legal issues, accounting and tax. They also drew up solid agreements with well-recognised local agents and distributors.</p>\r\n<p>To staff the new foreign plants, the company hired local workers, which caused many cultural/social problems. They thought it would be good to have local intermediate managers running the subsidiaries, in charge of the local workforce, mainly because they provide the necessary knowledge of the local business culture and market, and are in a better position to drive the business forward. Moreover, apart from hiring local workers, it was necessary to send two or three expatriated workers from Spain for one to five years in order to control the development of the new plant, supervise business operations and configure the human resource structure.</p>\r\n<p>As a whole, during internationalisation processes, it is common to find problems with expatriate workers as well as with local workers, especially due to culture shock and misunderstandings. Indeed, opening a new plant abroad leads to lots of problems, but little by little, these problems can be solved.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Managers have received good support from Spanish public authorities. The administrative process for the plan to adjust employment levels went smoothly, and outcomes such as the wage compensation arose as expected. Moreover, the company said it received financial and non-financial support for internationalisation from the <a href=""http://www.gipuzkoa.net"">Regional Government of Gipuzkoa</a>, the Basque Government through <a href=""http://www.spri.es"">SPRI</a> (Basque Society for Competitive Transformation), and from the Spanish Government through <a href=""http://www.icex.es"">ICEX</a> (Spanish Institute of Foreign Trade). The company is satisfied with all of the support received, and considers that Spain has good public measures to promote internationalisation.</p>\r\n<p>The company also asked a private firm to advise them with regard to their internationalisation strategy and to write a number of market research reports. They also contracted local consultancy firms in China and Brazil in order to get general information and support about issues such as business culture, legal points, accounting and tax in the destination markets.</p>\r\n<p>The company is also seeking public financial support for their plans to invest in a new research and development plant in Eibar.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>According to the managers, restructuring has led the company to be much more competitive and to enlarge its presence in global markets.</p>\r\n<p>During 2011, company results improved. More workers have been hired, so employment levels have fully recovered. The ten dismissals which took place in January 2010 have already been covered again over the last months.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the company is increasingly making use of subcontracting practices, as it gives more flexibility in relation to fluctuations in demand levels. The experience of the 2009&ndash;2010 crisis was so traumatic, that they do not want to take the risk of hiring too many workers in case of a future drop in demand.(they do not want to have a very rigid and weighty human resources structure).</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, labour relations within the company have also changed over the last couple of years, mainly as a consequence of the tense situation derived from unproductive negotiations and the subsequent strike at the beginning of 2010. Given this delicate situation, a pact was signed in the summer of 2011 between workers&rsquo; representatives and the management board, in order to facilitate and promote a more fluid relationship. The situation is still complicated.</p>\r\n<p>Looking to the future, the company is interested in developing its R&amp;D unit, and expanding its sales and service network, particularly its repair and after-sales services. Moreover, they are working on the opening of a new assembly plant in India.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>With regard to lessons learnt, the company management board has had a very poor experience concerning the negotiations with workers&rsquo; representatives. Noticeably, these difficulties had a very bad impact on the running of the company and on its social image. Managers have learnt that having a smooth relationship with workers is very positive for business performance. For this reason, they have signed the previously mentioned agreement with the works council. Managers regret that the works council is not collaborative and they are highly aware that the situation could always get worse.</p>\r\n<p>Concerning internationalisation, company managers believe that it is very important to reflect deeply on all issues involved, as it is essential to have very clear objectives. It is also necessary to avoid being discouraged easily, as internationalisation projects are likely to be profitable only in the medium/long term. Internationalisation provides great opportunities for business success, but persistence is needed. For managers, this means remaining open to diversity and to continuous change. Internationalisation is, to a large extent, a &lsquo;learning by doing&rsquo; process, and requires an effort to adapt, as each market has its particular specifications. Therefore, in order to overcome all obstacles that arise, a persistent attitude is indispensable.</p>\r\n<p>However, according to an article published in a regional newspaper, workers&rsquo; representatives attacked managers for trying to deprive local people of jobs by reducing the level of activity in Eibar, while hiring people in China and Brazil to work in the new plants there. Moreover, workers&rsquo; representatives consider that managers have hidden information about the company sales and income, as well as business objectives and strategies. Company managers deny this. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to talk to a worker representative. As was underlined in the previous sections, the relationship between the management board and the works council is still very tense, so the interviewed managers did not want to provide us with any contact name among the workers.</p>\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Jessica Dur&aacute;n and I&ntilde;igo Isusi, Ikei</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews </strong></p>\r\n<p>Technical Director and Board Member</p>\r\n<p>General Manager (CEO)</p>"~"Spain"~"28 - manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c."~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring*offshoring / delocalisation"~"2011-11-21"
"Friedrich Marx, Germany"~"Friedrich Marx GmbH & Co. KG"~"<p>When German company Friedrich Marx was hit by the global economic crisis, it implemented a restructuring process including the injection of new capital and internal reorganisation. This involved the reduction of costs through dismissals and short-time working. In the beginning, this was perceived as unfair by the staff and resulted in a dampened and mistrustful atmosphere, exacerbated by rumours and fears that further dismissals were imminent. The atmosphere improved when management clearly communicated the firm&rsquo;s situation and its plans, and when employees could see themselves that the company&rsquo;s situation was improving.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Friedrich Marx GmbH &amp; Co KG is a technical wholesale and retail company selling security systems (such as time-recording, access control, video monitoring), truck and car products (fleet management, navigation and positioning systems, taxi meters), marine products (motors, leisure boats, equipment for steering and gearing) and motor industry (engines and motor equipment). In general, the company is an exclusive partner of several leading manufacturers in its sales areas and it offers its customers individual solutions and advice from project planning to implementation and maintenance. Furthermore, a garage for trucks, cars and marine craft is run as a subsidiary company. Its customers include small, as well as large well known companies, and public clients.</p>\r\n<p>The company, a fourth-generation family business, was founded in 1905. Since then, there have been numerous change and diversification processes, seen as necessary to its growth. Current annual sales amount to about &euro;13 million.</p>\r\n<p>There are about 60 employees, with a further ten employees in the subsidiary company. They have either trained as wholesale or retail traders, or are skilled technical workers (such as graduate engineers and motor vehicle mechatronics technicians). They are aged from 18 (trainees) to 62 years. The average job tenure of 16 years means the company is characterised by a low labour turnover.</p>\r\n<p>For about 30 years, the management has been designed in such a way that the owner is responsible for technical and sales aspects while another person is responsible for the commercial area (finance and human resources organisation). In the beginning this was done by appointing an authorised officer; however, in the 1990s, the position of commercial chief executive officer was created. The person who currently does this job has been working for the company since 2006. He has a great deal of experience in the field of company restructuring, having previously worked as restructuring consultant.</p>\r\n<p>There are five sales or department managers responsible for the individual business units and the staff members working there. The business units are administered as autonomous cost centres in order to allow them to be individually monitored for effectiveness and efficiency, while at the same time giving them a certain level of autonomy.</p>\r\n<p>There is a works council in the company, but it was only marginally involved in the restructuring process.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008, the company experienced sales growth of 9% for the third year in a row and started to adapt its internal structures for the expected further growth. However, the planned restructuring went slowly as profit margins were not very good, the debts of the subsidiary company had to be covered, and the company could not make many savings.</p>\r\n<p>In autumn 2008, the company suddenly lost some important German clients who were active on international markets but who experienced a sharp drop in their own business due to the global financial and economic crisis and hence could no longer place orders with Marx. The effect of this chain reaction was that the company realised a sales decrease of slightly more than 22% in 2009 compared to 2008. This was mainly based on the development of the trade-oriented business units while the area of security systems was less affected in the short run as it is characterised by a stronger project orientation with longer order cycles.</p>\r\n<p>To counteract this decrease, which was caused by the financial and economic crisis, a restructuring process was implemented. Next to strategies to save costs it included the infusion of new capital and the initiation of company internal reorganisation measures.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring plan drafted by the company management as soon as the current and future difficulties became obvious was scheduled over two years, until the end of 2011. This was later supplemented by other measures extending until 2013.</p>\r\n<p>The plan, developed by the management, was presented to employees at the beginning of 2009 at a general staff meeting. The plan set out not only measures to reduce costs (mainly dismissals and short-time working, and also company internal reorganisation) but also to start negotiations with the firm&rsquo;s banks about access to additional capital.</p>\r\n<p>The 22% drop in sales led to immediate cuts in costs. Rent, for example, was reduced considerably by taking advantage of the change of ownership of the firm&rsquo;s office building. The lease agreement was terminated and cheaper rooms were rented.</p>\r\n<p>All employees who still were in their trial period were dismissed. Workers in the business units most affected by the sales drop were made redundant; employees with the shortest job tenure were selected for this, and a total, of six or seven employees were dismissed in those two measures.</p>\r\n<p>Further redundancies were avoided by introducing short-time working for all the company&rsquo;s other employees. Working time was reduced by 30% and this measure lasted for two years, although as the economic situation improved and orders grew, the short-time working level was reduced to 10%, with workers in some sub-units returning to normal working hours six months before their colleagues.</p>\r\n<p>Employees, shocked at the news of the measures, felt they were being unfairly asked to bear the negative consequences of a crisis for which they were not responsible. However, some of the workers understood that management was trying to maintain the highest possible number of jobs with the introduction of short-time working and made their colleagues aware that the alternative would be further dismissals. This raised the understanding and solidarity among the employees so that the introduction of short-time working was accepted. anagement then won over their workers by showing them that a 10% working time reduction did not result in a net wage loss of 10% but only 4% while they could take advantage of 10% more spare time.</p>\r\n<p>However, these cost savings were not sufficient to counteract the high sales decrease, and it became obvious that next to the extra cash already injected by the owner additional funds would be needed to promote the liquidity of the company and make it survive the financial and economic crisis. Accordingly, the firm&rsquo;s three banks were contacted, the restructuring concept including a liquidity plan presented and access to additional capital negotiated.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the expertise and experience of the commercial chief executive officer in the field of restructuring, the firm&rsquo;s banks were contacted in spring 2009 &ndash; when he could see they were heading for a crisis, but before it hit them. Not least because of this early approach, the banks were generally willing to provide capital. However, they requested an expert testimony by an independent third party. This was ordered by Marx from a private specialist consulting company which specialised in accompanying companies in crisis situations. Before the restructuring, the company did not have any contacts with this consultant. However, because of his own experience as a restructuring consultant, the commerical chief executive officer knew the consultant by name. Together with the consultant, the company again negotiated with the banks and presented the results of the consultant&rsquo;s assessment in mid 2009.</p>\r\n<p>The consultant&rsquo;s positive forecast resulted in the banks&rsquo; agreeing to provide credit worth &euro;500,000 in December 2009. However, this was conditional on the owner providing further capital, the workers forgoing their Christmas and holiday pay for two years and the largest strategic suppliers agree to a delay in their payment. Furthermore, the banks requested a debt guarantee of &euro; 1.5 million for the offered capital. This was provided by the owner, who assigned his life insurance, and the charge on his home) and the <a href=""http://www.bg-hamburg.de/cms_de-sta_art-470-3-4/Home.html"">Hamburg Alliance for Loan Guarantees (B&uuml;rgschaftsgemeinschaft Hamburg)</a> (see below).</p>\r\n<p>After initial unwillingness the employees accepted the deal, as management pointed out that the Christmas and holiday remunerations would be paid when it was again economically feasible.</p>\r\n<p>The firm&rsquo;s two or three largest suppliers also agreed: Friedrich Marx had been working for them as an exclusive importer for years and it would have been a considerable effort for them to find a replacement at short notice.</p>\r\n<p>The banks&rsquo; final condition was that the restructuring consultant monitored the planned measures for two years. This is a very common procedure in such situations. Due to the positive economic development of the company, however, the consultancy could be stopped in 2010.</p>\r\n<p>This restructuring was also used to push forward the internal reorganisation that had been started in 2008, as part of the planned growth strategy. This meant, for example, that sales were restructured. The company had products in its portfolio that were legally required (such as trip recorders for trucks) and was the exclusive representative for the manufacturer who held 90% of the market share. This had led to a rather passive attitude to sales of these items, with the company mainly reacting to customers&rsquo; enquiries. In the meantime, however, both the product portfolio as well as the market had changed. Consequently a sales strategy was developed with pro-active sales and the acquisition of clients in the forefront, leading to more targets set and better monitoring of the achievement of objectives.</p>\r\n<p>These adjustments also required changes related to human resources. Due to the long tenure of the staff, the responsibility felt by the employer especially for the older workers, and the high severance payments related to redundancies, the management tried to find within the new company structure new tasks for all employees. This step was supported by education and training measures and individual coaching. As consulting fees could be saved when the consulting contract was terminated earlier than planned, the company could use these financial means to cover the training costs.</p>\r\n<p>One or two workers, however, were encouraged to take early retirement, and a few other employees were motivated to leave the company on their own initiative when it became obvious that a future with the company was not feasible. These staff members were also actively supported.</p>\r\n<p>When recruiting new staff, the company explicitly looks for workers that support the new structure. It had found that, particularly at the departmental manager level, some employees were not able or willing to adapt to the new structures. Their employment contracts were terminated by mutual agreement and without any problems, as was the recruitment of new staff that well fulfil the new tasks.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>One challenge was getting the employees to understand and accept the need to save staff costs. In the beginning they perceived it as unfair; however, some employees took on the role of mediators which helped ease the tension and foster a feeling of the solidarity in the company.</p>\r\n<p>The staff-related changes (dismissals, short-time working, waiving of Christmas and holiday pay, and retraining) resulted in a dampened and distrustful atmosphere in 2009 and 2010. This was exacerbated by rumours and fears that further dismissals were imminent.</p>\r\n<p>However, as the company finances improved and some of the business units began to be excluded from short-time working, a certain level of jealousy arose among the departments. This was because it was not possible for individual workers to compare different units and therefore could not see the reason for what they saw as unequal treatment. Management tried to keep the workers informed by giving facts and figures on the current situation and the planned steps at annual staff meetings. This enabled employees to recognise that the company&rsquo;s situation was improving, which also improved the atmosphere. The major change of mood, however, occurred because the employees themselves experienced in the course of their daily work that more customers were contacting the company, more offers had to be written, more orders had to be fulfilled and more staff was recruited to deal with this.</p>\r\n<p>The banks&rsquo; stipulation that a restructuring consultant had to be engaged resulted in the company having to spend a large part of its new capital on paying the consultant. In the first year of restructuring, for example, the consultancy fees were &euro; 128,000 (out of a total of &euro; 500,000 advanced to the firm). The company felt the consulting services were not good value. Indeed, due to the expertise and past experience of the commercial chief executive officer in the field of company restructuring, the external consultants provided hardly any ideas that were not yet known to the management and partly were being implemented since 2008. those measures that resulted in sustainable change for the company were developed within the firm. This was because the management, who had already been working on reorganisation plans for two years, was much more familiar with their own company than the external consultant who had to submit a concept within few weeks of learning company procedures. However, the firm does feel that the changes were implemented more quickly than otherwise might have been possible, because the external consultant could pose more pressure on the internal structures than the management.</p>\r\n<p>Another big challenge was the risk to the owner&rsquo;s own funds that were additionally put into the company in the framework of the restructuring process as well as the collateral of his home and life insurance requested by the banks &ndash; a severe interference in the current private assets and the guarantee for the future of the owner, respectively. In particular, one of the firm&rsquo;s banks in spite of good cooperation for decades, requested conditions that were not feasible as they would have risked the livelihood of the owner in case of further difficulties in the company.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring concept and the restructuring measures were mainly developed by the management. The private restructuring consultant, as specified by the banks, came up with suggestions and measures, but although he provided some stimulus, his ideas did not result in the sustainably successful changes that the company itself brought about. Management say this is partly due to its own commercial expertise and knowledge of company restructuring, and partly due to its familiarity with the company and greater breadth of knowledge about its strengths and weaknesses. The obligation to hire an external consultant caused additional costs that did not bring about a commensurate added value. However, management did think that in companies where there is a lack of experience with crisis situations, it would be a good idea to approach a specialised consultant.</p>\r\n<p>The public support for short-time working (also see Eurofound, 2010) which was increased during the economic crisis through the stimulus package II (&lsquo;Konjunkturpaket II&rsquo;) is very positively assessed by the company. Short-time working was seen as necessary to achieve the cost reduction required for the restructuring without losing know how by dismissing employees. However, even though publicly supported further education was available to the workers during their short-time working, there was no demand for it from the firm&rsquo;s workers. Participation in training would also have separated the employees from their work for longer than would have been feasible at that time.</p>\r\n<p>The B&uuml;rgschaftsgemeinschaft Hamburg (Alliance for Loan Guarantees) offered a guarantee for the capital provided by the banks. The B&uuml;rgschaftsgemeinschaft Hamburg is a self-help organisation providing loan guarantees up to 80% of the credit amount and up to &euro;1 million, respectively, to foster small and medium-sized enterprises. Associates of the alliance are various chambers, guilds and enterprise confederations as well as credit institutions and insurances. The city of Hamburg as well as the federal government back the guarantees offered to the companies.</p>\r\n<p>The company were very positive about the B&uuml;rgschaftsgemeinschaft Hamburg not only because of the opportunity to get access to the required capital, but also in its help in negotiating with the firms&rsquo; banks. The B&uuml;rgschaftsgemeinschaft, for example, suggested that the company should only pay back the credit which was provided in December 2009 from 2012 onwards, so that the new capital could be used for restructuring and growth without affecting the liquidity due to a too-strict repayment plan. With this understanding of the company situation the B&uuml;rgschaftsgemeinschaft also helped persuade the banks to ease some of their credit conditions.</p>\r\n<p>The management also sees the provision of guarantees or collateral as the best public support for restructuring, particularly as in owner-managed small and medium-sized companies it can be the case that the owners do not have enough private assets to finance the restructuring, nor a sufficient level of collateral to offer the banks in exchange for credit.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The economic situation of the company improved quicker than initially expected and by 2010 the banks agreed to the management&rsquo;s request to dispense with the services of the restructuring consultant. By the end of 2011, 60% of the sales decrease experienced in 2009 had been levelled out, and it is expected that, by the end of 2012, the firm will achieve the sales levels of 2008. The &euro; 500,000 credits advanced in December 2009 was to have been fully repaid by April 2012, resulting in considerable cost savings related to credit interest and fees for the guarantee certificate. This will further increase the company&rsquo;s liquidity, and the company will not only have mastered the crisis but will have trimmed its structure and improved its competitiveness due to the reorganisation.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring has meant that six or seven employees have been made redundant, with all other employees affected by wage loss for a maximum of two years due to short-time working. However, because of the firm&rsquo;s access to public short-time working support the net income loss was lower than the level of additional spare time. Short-time working was stopped in mid 2011. The employees also had to waive Christmas and holiday pay for two years. Management, however, plan to honour these payments as soon as company finances allow.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the department managers, and some other workers who did not support the new structures left the company. These employees were supported in their transition to a new job or retirement, and the vacancies have been filled in the meantime. Hence, there were hardly any changes in staff numbers in the medium term. The remaining employees were trained for their new tasks. At the end of 2011, 75% of the workers employed by Friedrich Marx before the crisis were still working for the company.</p>\r\n<p>Management, seeing what has been achieved during the restructuring, are now motivated to introduce further changes as they realise that alterations previously thought impossible during times of &lsquo;normal business&rsquo; could now be implemented. The crisis situation is seen as a chance to improve aspects that could not or at least not as quickly have been changed in times of &lsquo;normal business&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The management feels that the public short-time working support and the credit collateral by the B&uuml;rgschaftsgemeinschaft has been an important contribution to the success of the restructuring. Short-time working was a considerable factor in reducing staff costs without loss of know-how, and the B&uuml;rgschaftsgemeinschaft was a valuable mediator between the company and the firm&rsquo;s banks in the negotiations on credit conditions.</p>\r\n<p>As for the hired private restructuring consultants, the management is convinced that such specialised support is of advantage in many cases. However, in their own specific case it did not bring about a satisfactory price/value ratio due to the company management&rsquo;s own expertise and experience. Accordingly, the generally prevailing idea among banks that they will provide capital for restructuring only if a restructuring consultant is hired should be reconsidered. Any company needing to be restructured which is unhappy with its consultant has hardly any room for manoeuvre as any credit has to be paid back immediately if the consultant resigns. Furthermore, some of the banks&rsquo; credit conditions, such as the design of repayment plans, are seen to be counterproductive as it can lead to a drain on liquidity.</p>\r\n<p>The company recommends that others in the same situation should conduct a detailed analysis of the causes of its crisis and develop strategies for dealing with it. The implementation of the measures needs to be continuously controlled and, if necessary, adjusted. It is also vital to be open with banks, employees and suppliers about what is happening, and the plans for restructuring. In order to maintain the trust of the stakeholders it is important to fulfil given promises. When in negotiation, a sound concept should be presented, even if it is felt that the negotiation partner will not agree. It has to be borne in mind that, in most cases a bank is not interested in closing down a company that is to be restructured and is more open to good arguments than might be expected. However, it is particularly important that in these discussions a company owner stays factual and rational despite their strong personal involvement.</p>\r\n<p>An important factor for the success of restructuring is the availability of sufficient commercial steering elements in the company. This may be a problem particularly in owner-managed small- or medium-sized companies as the self-employment is often based on a creative idea rather than on commercial expertise. Accordingly, it would be important to make entrepreneurs aware that they should organise commercial support (through employees or advisors) before the administration of the company gets too complex.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, a company crisis should be seen as chance to improve one&rsquo;s business, and for the company to come out of the situation in a stronger position. A successful restructuring can motivate managers to change in the future when opportunities arise. At the same time, it is important to remain self-critical and not to let success blind one to the possibility of crisis.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Irene Mandl, Eurofound</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interview</strong></p>\r\n<p>Knut Reher, chief executive officer, Friedrich Marx GmbH &amp; Co.

"M-TEC Energie.Innovativ, Austria"~"M-TEC Energie.Innovativ GmbH"~"<p>The internal restructuring of the Austrian company M-TEC Energie.Innovativ resulted in the introduction of a level of middle managers, the separation of office and sales staff, the establishment of job specification and the formal setting of targets. Company internal and market monitoring is now conducted in a more systematic and comprehensive way.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The Austrian M-TEC Energie.Innovativ GmbH was founded in 1972 by Karl Mittermayr as an electronics company. In the early 1980s, it began specialising in heat pumps and heat recovery and was quickly leading the way in this field due to numerous innovations and patents. It has received several awards, including the Upper Austrian Provincial Award for Environment and Nature 2004, the Energy Globe 2006, and Actor of Sustainability 2011. The company deals in refrigeration and ventilation engineering as well as in photovoltaics. Private, trade and industrial clients are offered a comprehensive package including planning and advice related to individual systems solutions, and fitting as well as after-sales services. Most clients are private customers in Upper Austria.</p>\r\n<p>Karl Mittermayr hoped that one of his sons would carry on the business after he retired, but initially this looked doubtful when the eldest opted for a career in banking. The middle son Dominik, after doing an apprenticeship in the family business, started studying medicine. Due to family developments he decided later on not to finalise these studies, but to begin working in his father’s company in the administrative field. At this stage Klemens, the youngest brother, was working in the company. Both brothers liked working in the enterprise, but did not want to take over the management.In 1998, Karl Mittermayr fell sick and during the period of his convalescence, Dominik and Klemens Mittermayr took over the joint management of the company.  This ‘trial period’ proved successful from the company’s viewpoint , and the brothers realised that they would be able to manage the firm together, even if neither wished to do this on his own. </p>\r\n<p>Karl Mittermayr gave his support to this idea and together they developed concrete plans for carrying out  the business succession. The process was achieved within about three years without any problems.</p>\r\n<p>In spring 2000, Dominik and Klemens started up a new company, the current M-TEC, and built a new company building. Then, from 1 January 2001, employees and customers, plus all the fixtures from the father’s company were transferred to the new firm which is owned and managed by the two brothers. At this point Karl Mittermayr retired from the management of the firm, although he was still active in the company, first in the form of limited part-time hours and from 2005 onwards for 20 hours per week. He was looking forward to be released from management duties and being able to focus on tasks he considered to be fun, such as, for example, the field of product development. While this meant that he worked more than initially planned, his sons described this as a ‘win-win situation’ because he had meaningful duties during his retirement while the company benefited from the innovations. However, at the end of March 2012, he had left the company completely.After the sons took over the business, the company experienced continuous growth. In order to prepare for further expansion, the company was renamed M-TEC Energie.Innovativ GmbH in 2011, while a second company, M-TEC BeteiligungsgmbH was formed to invest in other companies in the future.</p>\r\n<p>The company employs about 60 staff in administration, sales, planning/engineering, fitting, customer service, production and purchase/storage. Most are technically skilled workers. At the time of writing, in 2012, about one fifth of the employees are apprentices, and about 95% of staff is local. There is no works council.</p>\r\n<p>In its mission statement, the company dedicates itself to good communication, with honesty and respect for clients, employees, suppliers and authorities. The company is also keen on social responsibility, and is involved in social projects in Austria and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The majority of the company’s customers are homeowners who want a heating system, either installed in a house they are building, or to replace an old system. The firm’s marketing is based on the good quality of its products and services, with many orders coming from word-of-mouth recommendations. However, this strategy, although successful, hampers long-term planning. Since the business transfer, the number of requests for information and orders has increased dramatically. Ecological heating is particularly popular, and to meet this demand without compromising delivery times, more staff (especially fitters) have been employed. As a consequence, the number of employees increased from 13 at the point the business succession to almost 60 within about six years. The company was unprepared for this spontaneous growth; indeed Dominik and Klemens Mittermayr initially did not intend to employ more than 20 workers, and the company did not have the necessary organisational structure to deal with the influx and so, for example, the higher internal communication needs related to the increasing number of employees could no longer be adequately addressed .</p>\r\n<p>At this point the employers’ association, the Upper Austrian Economic Chamber (<i>Wirtschaftskammer Oberösterreich</i>) together with the austrian business council for sustainable development (respACT, – a business platform for Corporate Social Responsibility and sustainable development) wanted to increase companies’ interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and funded a two-day consultation by a CSR expert. Due to the company’s focus on sustainable heat and refrigeration engineering, aspects like ecology, economy and social responsibility had a significant value in the enterprise, even if CSR as a concept was new for the management. In spite of the little time available the brothers decided to participate in the CSR consultation.</p>\r\n<p>In the framework of this initiative, a stocktaking of the company was carried out, identifying organisational challenges and possible courses of action. This gave the company the impetus to continue working in this direction and to develop – with professional support – internal activities leading to an employee-friendly organisational development. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Due to the limited possibilites to plan the order level, the growth process of the company in the beginning was rather reactive insofar as the number of employees increased depending on the number of customer requests and orders. At this time the company was a typical small firm with a familial structure and flat hierarchies. There were only were two levels: the management (Karl Mittermayr, later Dominik and Klemens Mittermayr) and the rest of the staff. It became quickly obvious that the growing number of employees made this structure unsuitable, as management no longer had enough time to be the contact point for every worker, and there began to be problems in communication.</p>\r\n<p>Consequently, when there were about 30 employees, a first restructuring was realised. This organisational development mainly focused on the administrative field. However, although vital, the measures soon became inadequate again as the company continued to grow (to about 55 employees).</p>\r\n<p>In 2007–8, Dominik and Klemens Mittermayr finally decided to carry out an internal restructuring to ensure that the firm’s growth would not negatively affect the quality of their products and services. They decided to act when the previously good working atmosphere began to experience tensions. Staff members had begun to group together; long-term workers missed the familial structures and the opportunity to approach management directly. The employees no longer felt looked after and either let management know this directly or the brothers observed this themselves due to their operational involvement in the firm. The entrepreneurs, assessing this situation as suboptimal, took steps to create a structure whereby the employees would have a person whom they could contact directly, resulting in better communication.</p>\r\n<p>At about the same time, the Upper Austrian Economic Chamber (Wirtschaftskammer Österreich) informed the company about a joint project of the employers’ organisation and respACT dealing with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to fund  a two-day basic consultation. Dominik and Klemens Mittermayr decided to participate in this initiative and were contacted by a specialised CSR consultant. Up to this time, the entrepreneurs were not familiar with the concept of CSR but soon realised that the underlying ideas had been pursued by the company for years. They also felt, however, that a more systematic approach could benefit the company development. The consultation helped identify problem areas and the brothers decided to pay themselves for further help from the consultant.</p>\r\n<p>In a first step, a stocktaking of the enterprise was conducted to attain a systematic overview of the management and the strategic instruments and procedures available in the company. This was used as a basis to identify different fields of activities and what measures needed to be taken. The consultant did this by talking to management and conducting an employee survey about their needs. The management had already been aware of some problems, but some of the issues raised were new to them. The planned measures were ranked according to their priority and then a plan was drafted, outlining when each step should be taken.</p>\r\n<p>The measures referred to organisational and staff-related developments. The former entailed the development of an organigramme as well as job descriptions and a systematic documentation of all procedures. This meant that elements that previously only implicitly existed were made more explicit, providing a better orientation and traceability for management and staff. The system of appraisal interviews and employee communication, which had already existed, were expanded and adjusted to the demands of the growing company. For example, there are now structured weekly or monthly employee information sessions as it was realised that the growth made it necessary to keep individual departments better informed. This helps to avoid rumours and the dissemination of wrong information. One employee now has the task of keeping colleagues up to date. This comprehensive coverage is achieved by using everything from company notice boards, to intranet, e-mail, and Facebook.</p>\r\n<p>A milestone in the company’s organisational development was the introduction of another hierarchical level; middle management. There are now service, office, and sales managers, and by mid 2012 a chief fitting engineer should also have been recruited. These positions have been created to guarantee better support; provide a direct contact person for the employees and to relieve higher management. The idea was developed by the management with the support of an external advisor and the involvement of all employees. All affected engineers were involved in drafting the new job descriptions. As the recruitment was planned to take place internally, all the staff were encouraged to apply. However, as no one did, the management approached those staff members they deemed to be most suitable. After a short time for consideration all candidates agreed to take on the new tasks. This decision was communicated to the employees at a meeting. The new middle managers will participate in a management development programme initiated by management and financed by the company from mid 2012 onwards. This will mainly focus on the development of soft skills.</p>\r\n<p>The introduction of middle management also brought about a separation of office and sales staff. Previously, there had been no specific sales people, with employees responsible for the whole project, from finding customers to the technical implementation on the construction site. This procedure worked well in the beginning, but as the company grew it led to a very uneven workload. The company is funding an on-the-job training programme for its sales force, after an external advisor listened to the sales people’s pitches and devised individual training programmes for them.</p>\r\n<p>Another big innovation is that for the first time concrete objectives (annual and monthly objectives) have been formulated for the individual departments (and as a result for individual sales people). These will be monitored in future by the new middle managers. Across the company a continuous monitoring of orders and sales now takes place to get a better overview of current and future development.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process pinpointed the need for training. The company had already had a good experience of participating in a publicly supported qualification network,  so management decided do so again. However, M-TEC took the lead role in the design of the qualification network, in order to be able to tailor the training to its own needs. Another, anonymous, employee survey was carried out by external experts, on training needs and on more general mood indicators. This allowed employees the opportunity to voice their concerns freely, and the survey showed that training was mostly needed in the fields of communication, team-building, time-management, and dealing with stress and other soft skills. A training programme was developed and many employees participated.</p>\r\n<p>In line with the CSR concept, the management tried to involve the main partners of the company, such as the suppliers or craft customers with whom there were longstanding business relationships, in the restructuring. Together, they discussed technical/product related issues, and also how they could improve their cooperation.</p>\r\n<p>This process lasted for about three years and in 2012, is still not fully completed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>As with any change, the restructuring led to some anxieties. Employees were worried how it would affect their jobs, their work environment and the power/competence relationships. Management tried to allay these fears by open communication and information. For example, they explicitly said that the restructuring was not intended to cause job losses but sustainable growth.</p>\r\n<p>Management also needed to convince some employees of the need for their involvement in the organisational development and training activities, as in the beginning they did not see the necessity for such measures. The vast majority, however, were quickly convinced and willing to participate in the restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>During the three-year process there was a phase in which the external consultant was very active in the company, resulting in some reluctance by the employees to cooperate. However, this tendency was counteracted by the brothers’ involvement. </p>\r\n<p>The company strongly invests in apprenticeship training, as the main challenge to further growth is the scarcity of skilled craft workers, such as fitters</p>\r\n<p>Another challenge is the active steering of growth. As the company mainly serves private new customers, it strongly depends on external requests which it cannot influence. This results in constantly needing to be able to react at short notice. In order to prepare as well as possible for future developments, the company conducts active market monitoring of new construction and internal monitoring of trends (for example, how many requests result on average in an order). In 2011 the company invested in marketing, with a redesigned webpage, a new corporate identity and corporate design, new image folder and unit folder, which have already increased the number of client requests.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company approached consultants from the Upper Austrian Economic Chamber as well as using its own tax consultant in planning the transfer of the business from father to sons. Information from the employers’ organisation is also used for continuous market monitoring. The entrepreneurs are very satisfied with these services, particularly as the recommendations from the public and private consultants complement each other well.</p>\r\n<p>The publicly supported consultation on corporate social responsibility can be considered as one of the main reasons for entrepreneurs’ willingness to work, with an external consultant, on further organisational development. The management assesses the advice as very good, and worth the consultancy fees they paid after experiencing the support project’s two-day input. However, the entrepreneurs also pointed out that it is important to make sure that the external consultant does not have too much influence in the company as this might antagonise the employees.</p>\r\n<p>Management is happy with the financial support from the qualification network, even if most of the training costs still have to be borne by the company. Although the monetary benefit of this investment is difficult to measure, the entrepreneurs are convinced they have made the right decision. In 2012, they were planning to participate in a qualification network again, focusing on content oriented/technical training. This time, however, they are not taking the lead role, in order to avoid a big administrative burden.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, public support that positively influences demand in the energy field is beneficial for the growth of the enterprise, as this gives an incentive for private customers to buy its products.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>As the creation of the new management level happened at the end of 2011, no assessment of its effectiveness can yet be given. However, it has been generally welcomed by the employees, particularly as no one was recruited externally. The new middle managers already knew the structures, procedures and employees. In the first months after this measure was put in place there were no conflicts among the employees, and no one complained that the promotion of specific colleagues was unfair.</p>\r\n<p>The separation of office and sales force is in transition in 2012, resulting in a double burden for employees who have to finalise previous projects. It is, however, assumed that in future, there will be a more even workload throughout the year for employees.</p>\r\n<p>The staff liked the new objectives as they introduced for the first time concrete structures and objectives against which they can measure themselves. Besides the positive motivation due to the challenge, some of the employees are also concerned as to whether the targeted objectives can be reached.</p>\r\n<p>The company is now following a more strategic approach, aiming to act more proactively. The first steps in this direction have been set by the improved company internal and market monitoring as well as increased marketing activities.</p>\r\n<p>Management thinks the new company structure, enabling short and effective decision paths, is now prepared for further growth. Achieving sustainable growth is also incorporated in the company’s mission statement. There are plans for another employee survey after the restructuring process is finished, in order to assess satisfaction with the new structures and procedures. Clients are also to be surveyed, in order to assess the external effects of the restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>The management also wants to give staff the opportunity to continuously participate in training events and is willing to further invest in workers’ skills. At the same time they hope that the employees practically apply what they have learned – particularly in the field of soft skills, such as time and stress management or respectfully dealing with colleagues – and further develop their skills in communication This would not only help the company’s development, but would also positively affect staff living and working conditions.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring proved an intensive process for the management, in terms of time and emotion, and could not have been done alongside normal daily business. It was an advantage for the brothers that they could master this task together, giving them someone to talk to at an organisational and a personal level. Their good relationship contributed to the successful achievement of the organisational development and was further fostered by this jointly realised process.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The company wants to increase the popularity of its brand M-TEC, expanding its market leading position in heat pumps in Austria. The company development programme is seen as laying the foundations for this, and management think the employees are crucial to the company’s success.</p>\r\n<p>The management also considers that the initial consultation on corporate social responsibility was an important factor in the success of the restructuring as it provided, for the first time, an external company analysis and made the entrepreneurs take the time to assess which structures and procedures in the company work well and which should be improved. In addition, it also introduced the idea of ‘responsible management’, allowing it to be considered and thought through.</p>\r\n<p>Information and communication with the employees was also an important element during and after restructuring, helping to guarantee that all the staff are motivated to follow company goals. It was also advantageous that both owners and managers had been working in the company for a long time and were known to the employees as colleagues, enabling personal communication.</p>\r\n<p>The management of a medium-sized company should always be actively and strongly involved in the business in order to be aware of what is happening, so that issues can be addressed if necessary. There should be certain proximity with the employees, but at the same time there needs to be a certain distance as it is not possible for  management to be directly contacted by all employees. Accordingly, it is important, as a boss, to admit that one needs to delegate tasks and to establish a good management team to do this.</p>\r\n<p>There is also an important difference between small and large enterprises. In large firms there is already a certain basic structure which is not influenced by further growth. In small, growing enterprises, however, new structures have to be developed to cope with growth. Nevertheless, it takes longer to make a decision in larger enterprises, whereas smaller businesses have the advantage of being able to react more quickly. Another advantage of small businesses is their independence in making decisions.</p>\r\n<p>To other small and medium-sized enterprises experiencing quick growth, M-TEC entrepreneurs recommend involving an external consultant matching the company and the management. They feel that it is necessary to be made aware of specific aspects from an external person, particularly in intensive growth phases when management are so strongly involved in operations that they do not have time to work on new methods of organisation.</p>\r\n<p>For sustainable growth, it is important to be open to change and to be willing to invest effort and energy in that change, without which the company will not survive in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Irene Mandl, Eurofound</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interview</b></p>\r\n<p>Dominik Mittermayr, chief executive officer and owner,M-TEC Energie.Innovativ GmbH</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.m-tec.at"">http://www.m-tec.at</a></p>\r\n<p><b>Secondary source</b></p>\r\n<p>respACT (austrian business council for sustainable development), <i>Erfolg mit FAIRantwortung in Oberösterreich, Eine Projektnachlese,</i> Vienna, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Austria"~"43 - specialised construction activities"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2012-03-08"

At the same time, due to the interests and skills of the younger generation, exports have become a much more important aspect of the business. The process has not been finalised yet.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Nobilis Zrt. is a traditional family-run company, the leading producer and exporter of dried apple and sour cherry products in Hungary. The factory is in the county of Szabolcs-Szatm&aacute;r-Bereg, on the edge of South Ny&iacute;rs&eacute;g and Szatm&aacute;r, a world-renowned, fertile agricultural region, noted for the excellent flavour and quality of its fruit produce. The company&rsquo;s main products are: apple crisps, apple sticks, dried sour cherries, dried apricot, dried cranberries, chocolate coated products, nuts and food ingredients. The firm has patented delicate drying processes, to retain important minerals and vitamins as well as smell and flavour, and a quality assurance system to ensure that their food products are of the highest quality and support a healthy life-style.</p>\r\n<p>Tibor Nov&aacute;k, the sole owner of the company, founded the company in 1993, but active management has been transferred to his daughters and the managing director who is considered as part of the family. The Nov&aacute;k family plays a major role in senior management, with elder daughter, Mariann responsible for sales, marketing and PR, younger daughter &Eacute;va responsibile for innovation and quality assurance and her partner Lorand director of production and technology. The managing director is Krisztina Koncz, who is general manager and responsible for finance.</p>\r\n<p>The company employs approximately 70 people, with up to 110 during the apple and sour cherry processing season. Employment has increased from 55 at the start of the restructuring process in 2007. Labour turnover is very low at both management and operator level. Most managers have worked at Nobilis Zrt. for six to 12 years. Many employees come from the same families. Often whole families (mother, father, and children) work at the company. Men and women are equally represented in management; men comprise the majority at operator level. The management team is young and dynamic; the average age is 33. Operators are slightly older (average age 40-45). There is no trade union or works council at the company.</p>\r\n<p>The company shows continuous steady growth. Sales growth is due to expansion of the product range and the significant increase in export sales. Management believes in continuous innovation: every year, 25% of net income is reinvested into technical and product development. Development is supported by EU tenders which means HUF 100&ndash;200 million (&euro; 345,000&ndash;&euro; 690,000) extra financial resource to the company every year. Clients include Nestl&eacute;, Danone, Dr. Oetker and Cerbona and every hypermarket chain in Hungary (Metro, Tesco, Auchan, Cora, and Spar). In 2011, 30% of revenue came from export (due to restructuring) while in 2006, exports accounted for only 5%. The company exports to 13 European countries (the biggest markets are Germany and Italy) plus Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In Hungary, due to its particular history, only a few multi-generational family businesses exist. Most businesses in Hungary were established after the transition from communism to a market economy, so few Hungarian family businesses have business and management experience. Business transfer is a particular problem; unplanned, half-baked succession processes can damage families as well as businesses.</p>\r\n<p>Nobilis Zrt. has always operated as a family business. Both managing daughters have extensive experience of working in it &ndash; at operator level and above. Both worked for the company during school summer vacations and while they were students at university, Mariann undertook import purchasing responsibilities. She also took a one-year traineeship at a Rotterdam-based dried fruit and nuts merchant company. After graduation Mariann worked at Nobilis Zrt. in export and import sales while her father was the driving force behind the whole company. Eva proved her commitment to the family business during her university studies, writing a thesis on the company&rsquo;s chocolate-coated apple crisps.</p>\r\n<p>For the owner, it was natural his daughters would join the company. They proved their competence and commitment but the active involvement of the second generation often takes a lot of time and requires patience.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In a family business is not easy to identify the start and end date of succession. The involvement of the second generation is often so natural that even family members cannot remember when and how the process started. However, for Nobilis Zrt. the internal restructuring process/succession has three phases.</p>\r\n<table summary="""" border=""0""><caption>Table 1: Phases of restructuring at Nobilis Zrt.</caption><colgroup> <col width=""32.80%"" /> <col width=""19.40%"" /> <col width=""47.40%"" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr><th>Phases</th><th>Date</th><th>Description</th></tr>\r\n<tr><th class=""TableHeadRow"">Phase 1: Two generations work together</th>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>2000&ndash;2007</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>The second generation already joined the company but the founder is the main decision maker.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><th class=""TableHeadRow"">Phase 2: The younger generation comes to the front</th>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>2007&ndash;present</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>The second generation takes over the management of the company under the overall supervision of the founder.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><th class=""TableHeadRow"">Phase 3: The founder totally steps aside from the management of the company</th>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>To be detemined</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>The second generation is fully responsible for the management of the company and obtains ownership.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><em>Source: author&rsquo;s own compilation</em></p>\r\n<p>In Phase 1, the owner&rsquo;s daughters successfully worked for the company but their father dominated its management. Furthermore, family members always worked with him but only one at a time. Although he was ready to transfer management roles to his children, they were not ready to take over full control.</p>\r\n<p>In Phase 2, all family members and a trusted managing director were given responsible roles Although management is committed to planning succession, a transfer plan had not been prepared. The non-family financial director was appointed as managing director. Tibor Nov&aacute;k stepped aside from an active operational management role. He now concentrates his efforts on strategic planning, organisational development and product innovation.</p>\r\n<p>No formal announcement was made to employees, clients or suppliers about the change in management. Employees were informed in staff meetings about changes which affected them. However, Tibor Nov&aacute;k made a point of formally introducing his new management team members to key clients and suppliers. They were already well known to each other due to their long-term working experience at the company and family ties, which meant the second generation managers were easily accepted by the partners.</p>\r\n<p>The exact date of Phase 3 has not been fixed. Although the transfer process seems to be very successful, the last phase could be challenging for the family and the business. Generally this phase can throw up ownership issues, and the new team have to prove they can manage the company successfully without the founder present.</p>\r\n<p>At Nobilis Zrt. the internal restructuring process has facilitated expansion. Exports soared from 5% of sales in 2006, to 30% in 2011, after Mariann, who is responsible for export-import activity, took on her new role.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Although the succession process was trouble-free due to good communication among family members, the management of the company faced two challenges. First, they had to appoint a managing director. In a family business, one might expect a family member to take up this post. But neither of the two daughters wanted to do so. Mariann thinks she is not a top manager type and &Eacute;va is committed to product development and innovation. Personnel consultants, internet and newspaper postings, and informal networks were used to find the right person to take up the managing director role. Their efforts proved futile as applicants did not match the family&rsquo;s high professional and personality expectations. Subsequently, they realised that the current financial director Krisztina Koncz was suitable. She became managing director in 2007 after a career in banking. Unfortunately, her successor as finance director turned out to be unsuitable and so she also takes responsibility for this role too. The management team continues to look for a financial director or a managing director. Finding a suitable person to work in a company in a small town 300km from Budapest (M&aacute;t&eacute;szalka), able to make a long-term commitment to a family business, is not easy. Potential candidates often lack the sensitivities required in a family business environment.</p>\r\n<p>Second, both Mariann and Eva live in Budapest and this has constrained the restructuring process too. &Eacute;va and her partner Lorand commute every week between Budapest and M&aacute;t&eacute;szalka. They spend the weekdays in M&aacute;t&eacute;szalka and the weekends in Budapest. Mariann also used to commute but following the birth to her son now works from Budapest. In the early stages of restructuring, the distance made collaboration difficult. With the development of information and communications technologies, working together across large distances is now much easier. Bi-weekly management meetings &ndash; where all top management is present &ndash; are held in M&aacute;t&eacute;szalka and Budapest. These sessions provide the needed personal contact among directors. With Skype and remote access to company systems, the directors are able to manage the company over long distances.</p>\r\n<p>The top management team overcame the problems caused by distance but have not yet managed to find the right person to be their worthy associate in the management of the company.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was not planned, although managers prepared themselves for the forthcoming changes. Tibor Nov&aacute;k is committed to organisational development and continuous learning. Managers regularly participated in management training activities where they discussed the owners&rsquo; new role and responsibilities and management tasks. &Eacute;va and Lorand undertook MBA studies which also helped the restructuring process. They learnt how to use a project approach in their work which improved efficiency.</p>\r\n<p>Nobilis Zrt. used personnel consultants to try to find a suitable managing director.</p>\r\n<p>Automation of processes and IT developments are considered very important for the successful restructuring process. The company has benefited from EU subsidies for updating IT and machinery and for training in subjects including LEAN, English, management, and IT. The company benefited from EU subsidies under several operational programmes. These included the ones for economic competitiveness, agricultural and rural development, developing the economy and social renewal.</p>\r\n<p>At Nobilis Zrt. the management relies on feedback from members of their immediate work circle, and everybody has dedicated goals.</p>\r\n<p>Management books are also frequently read and often directors put into practice on a Monday what they have read at the weekend.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process has had many positive effects including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>new working practices, including strategy and planning;</li>\r\n<li>better product innovation;</li>\r\n<li>increased production;</li>\r\n<li>better marketing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The company has developed a new strategy, focusing on using fruits and vegetables of the South Ny&iacute;rs&eacute;g and Szatm&aacute;r area and reducing imports. The company will focus its self-developed, unique, premium products such as apple crisps, apple sticks, dried cherries and chocolate coated products in which the largest profits are made. The company also plans to introduce a new product line based on dried vegetables.</p>\r\n<p>Automation and IT developments are considered very important. The company gets HUF 100&ndash;200 million (&euro; 345,000&ndash;&euro; 690,000) in EU grants every year for new machinery. Production capacity has been enlarged; 65% of this is unused will be activated as part of a planned expansion into the US. The decision was made by the top management team to reach the company strategic goals and was financed by own sources, bank loans and EU subsidy.</p>\r\n<p>&Eacute;va learnt about lean management during a study tour in Japan and has now put this into place at Nobilis. Managers aim to develop the organisation to such a high level that they will be able to manage the company with one notebook from any point in the world.</p>\r\n<p>Restructuring has increased participation in international food trade fairs, exhibiting products with a view to increasing exports. The company has achieved rapidly increasing export sales, up from 5% to 30% of total sales. The firm&rsquo;s conquest of Asian markets is considered a great success, especially in Japan where strict food safety regulations meant that only high quality food imports are permitted. The company has formed various relationships with foreign distributors to reach export customers.</p>\r\n<p>During restructuring the number of employees has grown steadily, at a rate of about two to four new people every year.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>A family business can be a mixed blessing.. International statistics report that many family firms fail during the succession process due to family conflicts, inadequate communication and poor planning. Making a family business work is a hard job and there is no single success formula. Nobilis Zrt. shows that with preparation, empathy, tolerance and openness, family members can get excellent results, while the company profits from the family unique commitment and long-term orientation. The second generation management is a good team, They have no conflicts because they are working for the same goals, they are perfectionists and their belief in the company&rsquo;s products gives them a strong bond.</p>\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Attila Petheő and Judit Filep, Corvinus University of Budapest, Small Business Development Centre</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>Krisztina Koncz, managing director of Nobilis Zrt.</p>\r\n<p>Mariann Nov&aacute;k, Sales, marketing and PR director of Nobilis Zrt.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company website</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.nobilis.hu"">www.nobilis.hu</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Secondary sources</strong></p>\r\n<p>K&aacute;csor Zsolt: A Nobilis ember, N&eacute;pszabads&aacute;g, 2009; available at: <a href=""http://www.nol.hu/gazdasag/20090914-a_nobilis_ember"">http://www.nol.hu/gazdasag/20090914-a_nobilis_ember</a> (visited 12 November 2011)</p>\r\n<p>V&aacute;llalkoz&oacute;i negyed: Csokol&aacute;d&eacute;s almaszirom M&aacute;t&eacute;szalk&aacute;r&oacute;l a T&aacute;vol-Keletre, 2011; available at: <a href=""http://www.vallalkozoinegyed.hu/20110114/csokolades-almaszirom-mateszalkarol-a-tavol-keletre"">http://www.vallalkozoinegyed.hu/20110114/csokolades-almaszirom-mateszalkarol-a-tavol-keletre</a> (visited 15 November 2011)</p>\r\n<p>Vil&aacute;ggazdas&aacute;gonline: D&eacute;l-Kore&aacute;ba export&aacute;l almaszirmot a Nobilis, 2011, available at: <a href=""http://www.vg.hu/vallalatok/kereskedelem/del-koreaba-exportal-almaszirmot-a-nobilis-338225"">http://www.vg.hu/vallalatok/kereskedelem/del-koreaba-exportal-almaszirmot-a-nobilis-338225</a> (visited 15 November 2011)</p>\r\n<p>Profitline: Kelendő D&eacute;l-Kore&aacute;ban a m&aacute;t&eacute;szalkai almaszirom, available at: <a href=""http://profitline.hu/hircentrum/hir/212937/Kelendo-Del-Koreaban-a-mateszalkai-almaszirom"">http://profitline.hu/hircentrum/hir/212937/Kelendo-Del-Koreaban-a-mateszalkai-almaszirom</a> (visited 15 November 2011)</p>"~"Hungary"~"10 - manufacture of food products"~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2011-11-17"

Despite the difficult conditions imposed by restructuring which brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy, Osteoplant was able to meet all the investment obligations of its EU grant agreement and, in cooperation with external institutions, is continuing to innovate and develop products. </p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The dental implant factory Osteoplant, established in 1989, is owned by the Medical University Foundation in Poznan, Poland. The foundation, a fully independent legal entity, employs, at the time of writing (end of 2011) 33 people and conducts business in several areas, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>manufacturing and distribution of dental implants;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>organisation of conferences and scientific meetings;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>running a retail pharmacy outlet. </li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>Osteoplant was founded in 1996 and has become the main area of the foundation’s activity, both in terms of employment (about 15 people) and turnover. The highly specialised business domain and features of the restructuring process at Osteoplant are the reasons why the study has been limited to its activities. Therefore, the actions and decisions of the owner, the foundation, are presented only if directly related to the restructuring process at Osteoplant.</p>\r\n<p>The main area of activity of the implant factory is to develop, manufacture and sell the Osteoplant ® implant system that was invented and developed in the early 1990s by a team of dentists at the Medical University in Poznań. Since its certification by the Institute of Medicines in 1998, until 2008, Osteoplant rapidly and consistently increased its sales on the Polish market. This period saw a very dynamic development of the market and strong competition from international giants, but the Osteoplant ® system maintained its share of approximately 15%–20% of the Polish market. It should be noted that, in the last few years, there has also been strong direct competition from companies in Israel, Germany and Korea in the price range in which the implant factory operates (approximately 1/3 of the price of products of the global market leaders). In 2009–2011 after trying unsuccessfully, in collaboration with an external company, to enter the Norwegian market, it abandoned any further ideas of trying again to enter any foreign markets. The company’s manufacturing process for medical devices in the company has been conducted in accordance with quality management systems ISO 13485 and ISO 9001, and all products comply with the European Medical Directive 93/42/EEC and are CE marked.</p>\r\n<p>The current Director of Osteoplant joined the company in 1998, initially as a sales/medical representative. Since 2000, he has been given overall responsibility for running the entire business. The director, who is a dentist and who has a dentistry practice specialising in implants, gained his business experience before joining Osteoplant, while working in the marketing department of an international pharmaceutical company. </p>\r\n<p>Osteoplant currently employs three people in the sales office and one mobile sales representative. Its manufacturing department employs a production manager who acts also as the designer-constructor; a second engineer, responsible for quality management and five production workers, operators of digital machinery and two other people involved in the assembly and packaging of products, all with secondary or vocational education. Accounting and personnel matters are conducted jointly with the foundation, by staff members directly employed there. </p>\r\n<p>The implant factory is strongly linked with the region, as its core customers live in the Poznań and Wielkopolska region. The company is also still closely associated with the local academic community, including not only the Medical University, but also the Poznań University of Technology, the Institute of Metal Forming in Poznan and the local vocational school for digital machine operators.</p>\r\n<p>Osteoplant has always been very active in the Polish market for conferences, training and professional development for dentists. However, the company has no written HR strategy or statement of corporate social responsibility. The company is not unionised and does not have a works council.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>During its first 10 years, up to 2008, Osteoplant’s sales volume rose sharply, from about 100 implant sets, to more than 6,000 sets per year. If we look at sales volumes for the German market (about 900,000 implant sets per year) it seems that the Polish market, with total annual sales of around 30,000 units, has still a huge potential for growth. According to Osteoplant’s management, interest in implantology from Polish dentists is very great, although it is estimated only about 5% of dentists in Poland carry out implant surgery. It can be therefore expected that, as the Polish people prosper, the demand for implants, and consequently the factory’s products, should continue to grow dynamically.</p>\r\n<p>The company’s best year for sales was 2008. In 2009 Osteoplant applied for an EU grant for innovation, under the Operational Programme Innovative Economy. It wanted the money for research and development, including the construction of a new factory building. The net value of total investment in development and implementation of new and modified products of the Osteoplant ® implant system in 2009–2011 was PLN 6,114,100 (€ 1.4 million as at June, 2012) and a guaranteed share of the European Union grant was PLN 2 643 320 (€ 619,000). The company began to implement its plan in 2009. Unfortunately, shortly after signing the contract, the world financial and economic crisis started.</p>\r\n\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<CAPTION>Table 1: Gross Domestic Product and registered unemployment rate in Poland in 2006–2010</CAPTION>\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""42.70%"">\r\n      <COL width=""11.20%"">\r\n      <COL width=""11.20%"">\r\n      <COL width=""11.20%"">\r\n      <COL width=""11.20%"">\r\n      <COL width=""11.20%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n </TD>\r\n<TH>2006</TH>\r\n<TH>2007</TH>\r\n<TH>2008</TH>\r\n<TH>2009</TH>\r\n<TH>2010</TH>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">GDP (previous year = 100, constant prices)</TH>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>106.2</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>106.8</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>105.1</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>101.6</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>103.8</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">Registered unemployment rate</TH>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>14.8</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>11.2</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>9.5</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>12.1</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>12.4</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p><i>Source: <a HREF=""http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_oz_maly_rocznik_statystyczny_2011.pdf"">Concise Statistical Yearbook of Poland (In Polish and English, 7Mb PDF</a>) and <a HREF=""http://www.stat.gov.pl/gus/5840_677_PLK_HTML.htm"">the website of the Central Statistical Office</a> (GUS) (in Polish))</i></p>\r\n<p>The economic slowdown and rising unemployment, meant that many potential patients decided to postpone implant surgery. Sales declined; compared with 2008 there was a 5% drop in 2009, a 19% drop in 2010 and a 17% drop in 2011, at which point sales stabilised. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In May 2011, production was moved from rented premises to a new site in Dabrowa near Poznań, fully owned by Osteoplant. In planning its large investment, management had assumed a long-term trend of sales growth. However, the financial crisis caused a drop in turnover and financial performance and significant problems with liquidity. This was aggravated by its rigid investment commitments under the contract for EU funds. The crisis also led to banks demanding more stringent conditions before being willing to offer financing, and this meant Osteoplant’s suppliers, especially from abroad, started asking for 100% payment in advance. </p>\r\n<p>As a result, Osteoplant found itself in a difficult financial situation. In 2010, the foundation suspended the payment of bonuses to management and all employees at the implant factory and demanded cuts in production costs, and the budgets for training and marketing. All available funds were transferred to research and development, in order to comply with the EU grant agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The conditions of the EU grant to build the production site required that, not only had the level of employment to be retained, but also that additional staff should be recruited. This obviously affected the restructuring process at Osteoplant. In effect, the only negative consequence of the restructuring  on employment was several months delay in recruiting an employee to replace one of the white-collar workers who had voluntarily left. </p>\r\n<p>As for the formal aspects of the restructuring process, the company did not have a restructuring plan upon which Osteoplant employees were consulted, as decisions were taken unilaterally by the foundation and then announced to the management and employees.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The crisis arising from falling sales and serious problems with liquidity, aggravated by the rigid requirements of the EU grant agreement,  has been the first in the history of the company. Sales are expected to drop again due to cuts in the budgets for training and marketing. The cuts in direct production costs have also caused additional anxiety and stress among production workers.</p>\r\n<p>However, in spite of its short-and medium-term  difficulties, Osteoplant has been meeting all the investment obligations of its EU grant agreement and, in cooperation with external institutions, is continuing to innovate and develop products. </p>\r\n<p>Much of the current difficulty is caused by the very time-consuming and bureaucratic procedure of getting the EU payments. The company been close to bankruptcy for months because the regional office responsible for the management of EU funds is delaying payments, by asking for the company to correct minor errors with an interval of one month between each request. As a result, in late November 2011, the company is still awaiting payment of the first instalment of funds, even though the relevant documentation was submitted in April 2011. In the meantime, Osteoplant has completed the second stage of its investment project, putting itself on the verge of insolvency.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company has not sought and did not use consultants or any other external bodies to support the preparation and implementation of the restructuring programme. The restructuring was carried out relying only on staff and resources at Osteoplant and the foundation. </p>\r\n<p>Important factors for success in the restructuring process have been the loyalty and commitment of staff, built on trust and good relations between them and management.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The survival of the company still seems to be seriously at risk. Despite this, the company continues to implement the investment project agreed in the EU grant contract according to the original schedule. In 2012, it plans to purchase a new, modern digital machine as the grant was in fact associated with investment in machinery and equipment to be installed in the new building. </p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, in 2011, after two years of decline, the level of sales has stabilised. However, if the payment of the EU subsidies for already completed stages continue to be delayed, this award-winning, innovative company may face bankruptcy.</p>\r\n<p>The management points out that if it had known what problems would be involved in the use of the EU grant they would not have invested funds in developing their manufacturing capacity, but would instead have made greater use of outsourcing. Osteoplant did this very successfully in 2005–2006, when, unable to keep up with demand, they used companies in the US and Switzerland. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Osteoplant was named one of the three most innovative companies in Wielkopolska, in a competition organised by the Marshal’s Office. However, the company is on the verge of bankruptcy due to delays in payments by the Regional Financing Institution, part of the same Marshal’s Office, and this merits attention and action. </p>\r\n<p>Regional officials, often very young people, keep finding formal errors in the documents and reports sent to them. They generally spend nearly the whole of their allotted month going over the documents before requesting clarification or additional documentation. The company then has seven days to respond. After another month, the office requires further clarification on another minor point and the company, again in seven days, complements and enhances it. This has been going on from April 2011 to the point of writing, in November 2011, and none of the grant has been paid to the company. This has made it almost impossible to plan financial flows, especially in a small and medium-sized enterprise with limited financial resources, and this can be very harmful for the business.</p>\r\n<p>Another conclusion to be drawn here is that there should be more flexibility in the way the EU finances innovative projects, because current rules do not permit the introduction of any deviations from the plan during its implementation. This condition is very difficult to meet, and can even be counterproductive. For example, in tests conducted, Osteoplant discovered that a device it had previously planned to purchase was not after all needed, but found that it could not change the EU agreement and cancel the purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Radosław Owczarzak, Eurofound</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Dr Rafał Zagalak, Director, and Joanna Tokarska, Head of the Sales Office, Osteoplant  </p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p> <a HREF=""http://www.osteoplant.pl"">www.osteoplant.pl</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Poland"~"32 - other manufacturing"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2011-11-24"

Today Igor Skaza, the founders’ son, and his wife, Tanja, manage the company. Laura Rednak, sales and financial director, is the third member of the management board. </p>\r\n<p>Plastika Skaza aims to become one of the top producers of plastic products in domestic and international markets, and to develop specialised, highly sophisticated products in an environmentally friendly manner. The company has the Certificate of Quality ISO 9001 and conform to IKEAWAY, a business agreement for all IKEA subcontractors. Corporate social responsibility is integrated into the company’s mission. The company has also obtained the Certificate of Environmental protection ISO 14001. </p>\r\n<p>More than 90% of production is destined for export (to all EU countries, Russia, USA and Canada). Long-term partners include IKEA; Landis and Gyr, manufacturers of energy meters; Striebel and John, makers of energy distribution systems; and Gorenje, a Slovenian company, one of the leading European manufacturers of home appliances. Gorenje now comprises less than 10% of sales; before restructuring, this figure was 70%–80%. Successful cooperation with Gorenje enabled the firm to extend business operations to the former Yugoslav republics and profits have been reinvested to increase automated production. </p>\r\n<p>The company processes 4,500 tons of plastic materials per year using state-of-the-art machinery, knowledge and quality. The 44 injection moulding machines allow them to mass produce plastic injection moulding technology for industial production of  electrical, automotive, furniture, white goods, and general consumption goods. Attention is now turning to the consumer market, to making environmentally-friendly products, made of recycled plastics, under their own trademark. These include ‘Organko’, a bin for organic waste disposal. </p>\r\n<p>The company employs 160 people, although this has fluctuated in recent years (Table 1). The workforce is equally divided between men and women. Women work primarily in production while men work mainly in technical fields. Most employees are young, with an average age of 33. The company does not have a works council.</p>\r\n\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<CAPTION>Table 1: Average number of employees</CAPTION>\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""19.90%"">\r\n      <COL width=""19.90%"">\r\n      <COL width=""19.90%"">\r\n      <COL width=""19.90%"">\r\n      <COL width=""19.90%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TH>2007</TH>\r\n<TH>2008</TH>\r\n<TH>2009</TH>\r\n<TH>2010</TH>\r\n<TH>2011</TH>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>120</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>93</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>88</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>102</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>160</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p><i>Source: <a HREF=""http://www.gvin.com/"">GVIN business information data base</a></i></p>\r\n<p>Company sales and profits have recovered strongly after a serious dip in 2009 (Table 2). </p>\r\n\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<CAPTION>Table 2: Income and profit (in euro)</CAPTION>\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""15.20%"">\r\n      <COL width=""16.10%"">\r\n      <COL width=""16.90%"">\r\n      <COL width=""16.90%"">\r\n      <COL width=""17.10%"">\r\n      <COL width=""17.10%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n </TD>\r\n<TH>2007</TH>\r\n<TH>2008</TH>\r\n<TH>2009</TH>\r\n<TH>2010</TH>\r\n<TH>2011</TH>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">Sales income</TH>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>11.046.562</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>8.635.709</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>9.149.003</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>12.022.528</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>16.000.000 (app.)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">Profit</TH>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>72.382</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>26.549</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>88.992</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>181.314</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>no data</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p><i>Source: <a HREF=""http://www.gvin.com/"">GVIN business information data base</a> </i></p>\r\n<p>The company is deeply rooted in local community life, and has participated in several local/regional projects supporting local people and organisations. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Plastika Skaza has been restructured several times during the last 13 years. The first took place in 1999–2000 when Igor Skaza took over the business from his parents. Employees remember this period as a major milestone for themselves and the company. Under the new leader, the business underwent a period of development, shifting operations to foreign markets. The company began to pay more attention to customer needs, adapting more flexibly to market requirements. </p>\r\n<p>The next restructuring began in 2007, at a time when the company was highly dependent on a single large client, Gorenje, a locally based multinational company with over 5,000 employees, Gorenje accounted for 70%–80% of sales, but in 2007, when it stopped outsourcing, many subcontractors, including Plastika Skaza, lost their contracts. Plastika Skaza, which was also experiencing increasing late payment problems with Slovenian clients, then began to cooperate intensively with foreign customers, especially IKEA. Today export markets predominate and since 2009 have contributed to significant sales growth, with sales for 2011 forecast to be € 16 million.</p>\r\n<p>The time period for the restructuring event described here cannot be defined precisely: management indicates that this is an ongoing process. </p>\r\n<p>The third restructuring process involved a 10-year strategic plan to set up the company’s own brands. However, they are hampered by the fact that they have a very weak competitive advantage – Slovenia is ranked 45th according to the 2010–2011 <a HREF=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2010-11.pdf"">Global Competitiveness Report (6Mb PDF)</a>. Foreign buyers often prefer companies in countries with a more supportive business environment. Skaza wanted to continue production in Slovenia but as labour costs are relatively high, this requirement is feasible only where projects have a high value added, which can be achieved only through the development of their own brands.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The decision to enter the own-brand market raised a series of questions, including defining potential fields of business and what products should be launched. Three product areas were identified:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>convenient waste disposal;</li>\r\n<li>practical dishware with a cutting-edge\r\ndesign;</li>\r\n<li>modern eco-friendly home products. </li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The decision about which product to launch was based on detailed market research. The first, ‘Organko’, a technically sophisticated and user-friendly version of a fermenting waste bin to collect organic waste without the unpleasant odour, is made of recycled plastic. It reduces the amount of organic waste in landfills and also reduces greenhouse gases. It was inspired by the method of collecting organic waste in Japan, using the concept of ‘bokashi’ (fermenting method in an air-tight bin), which was implemented following observation of good practice examples abroad. The idea was developed in-house (drafting, development, planning), while production was outsourced to a nearby subcontractor. The whole process took two years, starting in 2007. By the end of 2010, 3,000 units had been sold online and in organic shops throughout Slovenia. Improved sales were forecast for 2011 mainly because mandatory segregation of organic waste came into force at the end of June 2011. By the end of 2011 11,000 units were sold. </p>\r\n<p>‘Yodo’, a set of homeware, also made out of recycled plastic, was designed with the help of well-known industrial designers in a competition where the winner gets to bring the design to the production stage. Serial production is to begin in September 2012 and products are expected to be available in January 2013. By 2015, 40% of sales revenue is expected to come from the Organko and Yodo brands.</p>\r\n<p>‘Cuisine’ is a series of low-end practical dishware items (bowl, cup, plate, mug) expected to be on the market in March 2012. The company expects to take a 5% Slovene market share in this segment. The brand name is multilingual and will also sell abroad. The first series of Cuisine has been designed by Ivana Potočnik, winner of a competition to design a kitchenware line.</p>\r\n<p>The administration informs middle management every week about plans and receives feedback. The remaining employees are informed about the strategic plans at annual meetings held for production workers or at the closing ceremony at the end of the year, where management outlines the latest objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>When Plastika Skaza lost its contract with Gorenje, its revenue dropped from €12 million to €8 million and it could no longer extend the fixed-term employment contracts of 30 employees, cutting the workforce from 110 to 80. The firm’s owners said this caused undue stress and led to a feeling of failure, especially as the company had the reputation of being fair and reliable employers. However, within six to ten months, the majority of employees, were taken back on. Those previously dismissed were prioritised for recruitment. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company did not use external consultants for restructuring, although some were used to help with minor changes in business operations. The company decided to outsource storage locally instead of building their own warehouse. Considerable cost savings were achieved this way and they plan to continue to outsource in future</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring took place according to the initial plan, but according to management successful implementation required continuous adjustment. In 2011, due to a large increase in orders employee leave was suspended during the summer and the company introduced work in four shifts. In early 2011, the company increased wages by 10%. Salaries are above average for Slovenian manufacturing companies. Manufacturing workers can earn up to 40% above their normal wage based on performance. Employees may also benefit from submitting proposals for ‘Continual Improvement in the Company’, resulting in cost savings. Middle management executives and board members are rewarded for achieving profit objectives. </p>\r\n<p>Management staff considers the third (and current) wave of restructuring projects to be a time of new challenges and opportunities to prove themselves in areas where they have previously had limited experience. Employees are aware that the company’s future depends on their joint efforts to achieve specified goals. Staff feel they are learning the necessary new knowledge from their formal education as well as from self-education and their own ingenuity. Employees also believe that management ‘has an ear for their new ideas’. They are trying to see novelties as a challenge, not as a problem, and tackle them with an attitude of mutual benefit. One result of restructuring is the shift in strategy towards environmental protection. Although Plastika Skaza does not have a large impact on the environment, striving for continual improvement, awareness of the importance of protecting the environment, and efforts to gain customer trust, stimulated them to establish an environmental management system in accordance with International Standard ISO 14001:2004. Employees work according to the adopted environmental management policy with regard to:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the prevention of pollution;</li>\r\n<li>energy consumption;</li>\r\n<li>noise control;</li>\r\n<li>waste-handling and segregation;</li>\r\n<li>employee health and safety;</li>\r\n<li>open communication with employees and the\r\npublic;</li>\r\n<li>continuing improvements of the environmental management\r\nsystem. </li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>Management is aware that employees and people who live in their environment ought to be able to participate in forming their environmental policy, so they consider all recommendations and ideas that could contribute to the improvement of the policy. Partnership relations however also oblige them to take into account the standard IKEA WAY.</p>\r\n<p>The company has recently decided they will no longer buy recycled plastics only from others, but will also recycle themselves. Investment in technology and staff training is estimated at €1m per year. Unfortunately, they failed to secure a hoped-for grant from the Eco Innovation Call, which is supported by the European Commission and which promotes eco-innovative projects in different sectors that aim to prevent or reduce environmental impacts, or to contribute to the optimal use of resources. The investment is greater than their usual investments in development, which are normally about €500,000 to €700,000 per year.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the global financial crisis, the company is operating successfully. Old customers such as IKEA, Landis and Gyr, Striebel and John, and Gorenje have been retained, and the volume of business has increased. Landis and Gyr is moving its tools for electrical boxes from China to Plastika Skaza, which has already begun production. The company has also become a development partner for IKEA who have invited them to develop a new leg for kitchen cabinets as part of a new generation of IKEA kitchens.</p>\r\n<p>Plastika Skaza expanded employment from 130 to 160 during 2011. They aim to grow to 300 by 2015 by increasing completion services for foreign buyers and selling own-brand products. By automating production and emphasising development, they were planning to raise value added per employee from €29,000 to €40,000 by the end of 2011. Additional employment is planned in R&amp;D, marketing, purchasing and sales (but not production, due to automation). Approximately €45,000 is spent annually on staff training, education and coaching. A lot of the training is provided internally. External trainers, including suppliers, are hired for technical and managerial staff. The long-term vision is to remain financially stable, selling their own-brand environment-friendly products globally.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Flexibility is the highest priority in the restructuring of small businesses. As the management team had only three members, it was easy for them to coordinate on a daily basis. Management is not only involved in development of the company but also very closely connected to the production process. Managers participate in production eight hours a week, in order to obtain first-hand experience of the main issues workers deal with. Small companies have the advantage of being able to react quickly to changing circumstances. The company built their restructuring processes on a philosophy that state aid is not needed for success. Another difficulty relates to the problem of domestic companies’ protection in many foreign markets. This is becoming a regular issue, as small Slovenian companies face competitiveness problems. In Poland, for example, some cantons introduced tax havens, payment of certain contributions, grants for land purchases, and technological equipment. Such activities results in the demolition of competitiveness that a company can achieve in the Slovenian environment.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Karin Širec, Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Laura Rednak, Commerce and Finance Manager, Plastika Skaza d.o.o.</p>\r\n<p>Renata Goličnik, sales clerk, Plastika Skaza d.o.o.</p>\r\n<p><b>Secondary sources</b></p>\r\n<p>Presentation brochure of the company: ‘Plastika Skaza: Every part matters’.</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.plastika-skaza.si/"">http://www.plastika-skaza.si/</a> </p>\r\n<p><b>Secondary sources</b></p>\r\n<p>Organko: Product web presentation.

The qualifications of newly employed staff are also more systematically evaluated and checked for their compatibility to the new business profile. </p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile </h2>\r\n<p>Adam Trybusz founded Probuild in Poznań in 1993. In 2001, he co-founded another company LT Service (in which he has a 70% stake) that works closely with Probuild – and thus the Probuild Group was set up. Mr Trybusz is supported by two senior executive officers in managing the Poznan-based group. It provides services to the Polish real estate market in the field of construction and investment project management consulting, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>feasibility studies;</li>\r\n<li>evaluation of investment profitability;</li>\r\n<li>conversion planning;</li>\r\n<li>value engineering;</li>\r\n<li>technical due diligence;</li>\r\n<li>interior design;</li>\r\n<li>construction supervision;</li>\r\n<li>project and construction management;</li>\r\n<li>financial inspections.</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>The group was involved in creating and implementing major projects in the Polish market, whose total value exceeds €150 million. The group’s clients include many well-known and reputable companies, such as: Von der Heyden Group, Franklin Templeton Investments, Dalkia Poland, BZ WBK, Ernst &amp; Young, PZU AM, and Knight Frank. Moreover, Probuild Group has been honoured three times in the ‘Builder of the Year’ competition organised by the Polish Association of Construction Engineers and Technicians. It won the prize for the highest quality service as a project manager in 2000, 2003 and 2007. At the end of 2011, the Group employed 32 staff. The group is well rooted locally due to it acting as project manager in a series of prestigious projects in Poznan, and also because it has participated in transforming investment planning and feasibility studies in the city and wider region. The group also relies heavily on local workers. The group has no trade union nor works council.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Until 2008, the Probuild Group was in a highly competitive market dominated by large international players. It had a good reputation and was steadily increasing turnover and employment. However, as the financial crisis hit, although the Polish economy did not fall formally into recession, many of its sectors, including real estate investment, were clearly affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<CAPTION>Table 1: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Sales of construction and assembly output </CAPTION>\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""27.60%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.30%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.30%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.30%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.30%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.30%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n </TD>\r\n<TH>2006</TH>\r\n<TH>2007</TH>\r\n<TH>2008</TH>\r\n<TH>2009</TH>\r\n<TH>2010</TH>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">Sales of construction and assembly output</TH>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>118.1</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>115.5</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>112.1</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>105.1</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>103.3</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">GDP (previous year = 100, constant prices)</TH>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>106.2</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>106.8</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>105.1</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>101.6</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>103.8</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p><i>Source: Central Statistical Office (<a HREF=""http://www.stat.gov.pl/gus/wskazniki_makroekon_PLK_HTML.htm"">GUS</a>) and the <a HREF=""http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_oz_maly_rocznik_statystyczny_2011.pdf"">Concise Statistical Yearbook of Poland, 2011, p366 (in Polish and English, 7Mb PDF)</a> </i></p>\r\n<p>The group’s management, who had been monitoring the capital investment market in Poland and observing the signals from experts about the market overheating, were able to prepare at a very early stage – between 2007 and 2008 – for a period of poor economic conditions. As the first signs began to appear in late 2009 that the Polish investment real estate market was improving, the group, due its successful internal restructuring, was ready immediately to begin providing services to the major development of the Andersia Business Centre – the third stage (after the Poznan Financial Centre and the Andersia Tower) to be built at Anders Square in Poznań.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The process of internal restructuring within the Probuild Group lasted from the last quarter of 2008 until February 2010. It was carried out as a reaction to the collapse of the market for professional real estate services in Poland, which had been badly affected by the crisis in the global economy. The group was hit when banks withheld the funding for major construction (Andersia Business Centre Hotel in Poznan and Gdansk Długi Targ) for which it was project manager. As a result, the group lost a lot of its planned revenue and had to slash operating costs to guarantee financial liquidity. The restructuring measures it took were: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>changing standard contracts of employment into management\r\ncontracts (semi-self-employment); </li>\r\n<li>the closure of two departments (furniture fixtures and\r\nequipment, and interior design) with the loss of four jobs;</li>\r\n<li>the maintenance department was reorganised and five\r\ntechnical staff members were hired by the new employer, who took over this area\r\nfrom the group; </li>\r\n<li>all salaries were cut by 30% through amendments to\r\nemployment contracts; </li>\r\n<li>suspension of payments of bonuses and allowances;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>budgets for training, equipment, representation,\r\nadvertising and marketing were cut;</li>\r\n<li>limiting the hiring of external specialists. </li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p>However, employer-paid private health insurance and subsidised lunches were not abolished, and working time was not cut. Employees did not participate in the development of the restructuring plan and were informed about it only in October 2008. The owner and senior management met each employee individually, proposing either adoption of the revised terms or termination of their employment. The owner and the management were open to any inquiries and suggestions, and the employees, aware of consequences of the market collapse adopted the proposed changes with great understanding. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>These restructuring activities were not preceded by a period of analysis and planning, as the group’s substantial loss of income required quick and decisive reaction to ensure its survival. No other party, such as the local employment office or the Chamber of Commerce was involved in the restructuring, which was funded solely from the group's own supplementary capital and reserves accumulated during the boom. This was possible thanks to the responsible approach to financial management consistently pursued by the owner and managers of the group. In the opinion of the owner and senior manager interviewed, the fact of having built up its own financial reserves was of decisive importance for the company’s survival in the period of market collapse. </p>\r\n<p>Redundant workers were not offered any support in the form of outplacement, training or services of the employment agencies, because they were already highly skilled specialists who were not interested in changing career. Other employees whose employment conditions changed, could count on the owner's and senior management’s support, because of the integral culture of the company.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The only external advice and support came from legal experts who prepared the agreements to amend staff contracts in the very first phase of restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>Management say the reason for not getting any other kind of outside support was simply that, because the crisis hit the construction sector so early, the group had begun restructuring months before anti-crisis measures were implemented by the public authorities. There was also a lack of information on what support there was. As a result, public suport was not even considered by the management during the internal restructuring process which focused on the need to reduce costs in order to ensure liquidity.  </p>\r\n<p>The owner and senior manager stress that important success factors in the restructuring were staff loyalty and commitment. They say this stems from the staff’s employment stability, mutual trust, flexibility of management and the benefits package retained during restructuring. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring was carried out within its deadline, and its objectives were achieved, as the group’s reduced workforce has maintained the same level of output and is well regarded in the market. Management feel the solidarity experienced throughout a very demanding period has contributed to increased levels of commitment and efficiency from staff. In the early days of restructuring, the atmosphere at work deteriorated and motivation decreased, caused by the redundancies and a temporary loss of confidence in the employer. However, confidence and motivation have been rebuilt. New employees have been hired and a new, more specialised team has emerged, contributing to the group’s improved quality of work and services. Initially, the restructuring resulted in a limited amount of services offered by the group, but this allowed a focus on selected areas of activity. Later, the group again began to expand its services, such as technical due diligence. </p>\r\n<p>Management feel that although the restructuring has not directly affected the wealth or social networks of the owner and senior managers, it has to some extent affected everyone involved with the group, their families and friends, and its business partners and customers. Ultimately, however, restructuring has strengthened the group, as it has led to improved specialisation, productivity, motivation and confidence in performing in specialised areas. The business profile has refocused on the most profitable areas. The qualifications of newly employed staff are also more systematically evaluated and checked for their compatibility to the new business profile. Their capacity for self-development has also been more carefully examined.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process has not undergone any formal evaluation although, as can be seen, some conclusions have been drawn. These are reflected in the human resource management policies and the group’s plans for further diversification. These plans assume further growth in new business areas (such as due diligence): systematic investment in upgrading employees’ skills, particularly in marketing and PR, and the networking of staff with mostly technical and engineering backgrounds. A system of employee-assessment plus a new recruitment and selection policy have been developed, as well as contingency plans in case more restructuring is necessary.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, management are positive about the restructuring process. Employees who decided to stay with the company throughout a difficult period are thought to feel the same way, as they can now contribute to new projects and expect a systematic increase of salaries plus the return of other benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The management say restructuring a small business is more difficult than in a large corporation, due to the stronger emotional bond between employees and employers. Moreover, in a small firm like theirs, the success of restructuring largely depends on the support of a few well-educated and specialised workers who have to be willing to take on a more diverse range of activities, such as administrative, financial and directly executive roles. The crisis also meant that access to financial and human resources for small businesses was significantly reduced. All these factors resulted in the need for greater effort in communicating with employees. Management feel it is also important that, as soon as possible after a company regains its financial health, it should at least partially compensate its employees for lost revenues or other benefits. At Probuild, the owner and senior manager’s openness towards the team and their readiness to respond to questions were absolutely essential. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Radosław Owczarzak, Eurofound</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Adam Trybusz, founder and owner of Probuild Group</p>\r\n<p>Antoni Chałupka, CEO of Probuild Sp. z o.o.</p>\r\n<p><b>Secondary sources</b></p>\r\n<p>Company booklet received during the interview. </p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p> <a HREF=""http://www.probuild.pl"">www.probuild.pl</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Poland"~"43 - specialised construction activities"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2011-11-03"

The company's restructuring strategy of diversifying and changing its business model, implemented in response to adverse changes in legislation and in the market’s evolution,  resulted in continued growth in sales and the preservation of a family business, with very low staff turnover and high levels of trust and investment in developing the skills of its employees.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>PUH HANT was founded in 1994 by Maria and Andrzej Kurowski, who are still the owners and executive managers. Andrzej Kurowski graduated from the University of Technology in Poznan and completed postgraduate studies at the city&rsquo;s University of Economics. The company was founded to take advantage of the market opportunity created by the introduction of the VAT law in Poland in 1993. PUH HANT was among the first companies in the market to sell and service cash registers and fiscal printers and it quickly managed to achieve a strong position, in Poznan itself, plus the wider Wielkopolska region, and nationally.</p>\r\n<p>PUH HANT 's mission is to assist in the optimal selection, delivery and installation and servicing of technical equipment used to support the sales processes in every type of retail outlet. In the first period of activity, from 1994 to 2001, the company achieved average annual sales growth of around 20%. The growth rate then stabilised at a slightly lower level, but the company continued to grow. In 2006, employment peaked at 36 people, on different types of contracts, then decreased slightly. Employees are mostly male with a secondary technical education. Many of them continue their studies at the Poznan University of Technology in the evenings and at weekends, with financial support from the employer. Due to the nature of the fiscal devices industry, workers involved in installation and servicing must have appropriate state certification and a good reputation.</p>\r\n<p>The company is very well established and active in the local community. Maria Kurowska is a board member of the non-profit association <em>Komitet Partnerski Ziemi Goślińskiej</em>, founded in 2003 to develop partnerships between local businesses, the city authorities and between partner cities. Andrzej Kurowski has been a founding member of the Wielkopolska ICT Cluster, an initiative begun in 2006 and supported by the city authorities, which brings together numerous companies and institutions including Poznań University of Technology, Poznań University of Economics, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Centre. Both company owners and most of their employees live near the company premises. The company also has a very large share of local market sales and service of fiscal devices and other areas of its business activity. can be characterised as having a strong family culture and has neither a works council nor trade union representation. PUH HANT does not have a written human resources management policy nor a policy on corporate social responsibility.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The fiscal devices industry is particularly dependent on the tax requirements imposed by the authorities in the various sectors of the economy. The level of sales has also, to a much lesser extent, been related to the overall economic situation. Thus, the change in tax laws in 2002/2003 reduced the demand for cash registers from about 200,000 to 100,000, and after several years, to the current level (in 2011) of around 40,000 to 50,000 nationally. This represents a fall in demand to around 25% compared with the peak period.</p>\r\n<p>There are also high technical requirements for such equipment, with fiscal regulations set out to ensure constant reliability. By law, if a cash register breaks down, then the shop has to be closed. Regulations also cover the safety of the records of transactions recorded on the till. They apply not only to software, but also the technical specification of the hardware, such as what media should be used to store transaction data, or what kind of batteries should be used as back up if mains electricity fails.</p>\r\n<p>Another requirement for the fiscal equipment manufacturers is to ensure a constantly available service by certified personnel throughout the country. Many till manufacturers cannot independently organise and maintain such a national service network and, therefore, establish partnerships with specialised companies which provide service networks for several manufacturers.</p>\r\n<p>The close relationship of the sector with the tax legislation means that there are statutory inspections of fiscal devices. These inspections in the first years after 1994 were required every six months, then once a year, and current regulations (2011) now require such inspections once every two years. Statutory inspections are paid for by the government and their frequency therefore directly affects the income of companies, such as PUH HANT, which provide such services.</p>\r\n<p>Competition in the industry has intensified in recent years because of the growing number of new entrants in the market. These are mainly companies selling and servicing computer equipment which, due to a weakening of growth in the market for personal computers, have been attracted by the higher margins in the fiscal devices sector.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Despite this, PUH HANT&rsquo;s record has been impressive as it has been installing more or less the same amount of cash registers throughout the whole period of its activity. It should be noted, however, noted that over the same period the average price of a cash register has dropped significantly. In 1997, the average price of a cash register was around PLN 2,000&ndash;PLN 2,500 (&euro; 500&ndash;&euro; 625) whereas in 2012, it is about PLN 1200 (&euro; 300). However, the margins have remained the same percentage.</p>\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s ability to maintaining a reasonable growth in average annual turnover during its 17 years would therefore not be possible without a successful diversification strategy. PUH HANT consistently strives to develop products in related fields and each time there is a slowdown in the market for cash registers the company adapts by restructuring, altering its business model, and increasing its diversification.</p>\r\n<p>The company consciously pursues a strategy of building comprehensive ICT solutions and services for clients in the retail sector in the domestic market. Their range currently includes the sale, installation and service of hardware, software (operating systems, antivirus software, management support systems), CCTV and monitoring systems, development and positioning of e-commerce solutions and operating a local internet provider network.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring also applies to the business model. For the first few years, the company relied primarily on its own full-time employees or co-operated closely with several self-employed people. Gradually, however, the proportion of partners as independent operators increased, while the number of full-time employees remained constant. It is worth noting that there have never been any job cuts at PUH HANT. As modern logistics, courier services and the internet replaced the need for a traditional office, the company closed its second office in Poznań and focused on building a network of partner companies in the Wielkopolska Region and nationally. This led to one of two employees moving to the main office and another one retiring.</p>\r\n<p>PUH HANT has always tried to develop and strengthen the atmosphere and culture of a family business based on a high level of trust and respect and very stable employment. It supports employees in their professional development, for example through financial help to study in their spare time in university schemes and by funding business trips to foreign trade shows.</p>\r\n<p>The owners make it a top priority to monitor its customers&rsquo; development, trying to meet their needs comprehensively, which could mean further diversification of the business. The company&rsquo;s long-term vision assumes its turnover coming equally from three areas of activity:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>sales and services related to the cash registers (installation, programming, configuration, maintenance, development and integration of networks with other equipment);</li>\r\n<li>domestic sales and export of equipment (industrial computers, servers, programmable keyboards, barcode readers and radio frequency identification technology);</li>\r\n<li>distribution and integration of software (operating systems, antivirus and management support systems).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>There has been only one serious situation in the company's history, a threat of loss of liquidity in late 2008 and early 2009. As a result of economic slowdown in Poland, the company began to have difficulty with delayed payments. In a short period of time, approximately 60% of the company's customers delayed paying charges for over one month. This situation persisted for about half a year. Fortunately, thanks to a good relationship with its bank, PUH HANT managed to obtain additional financial resources and was able to secure liquidity. Finally, a change of the tax regulations, which caused a massive operation to update software update forced the company&rsquo;s debtors to pay up, as only service technicians who were authorised by the company could reprogramme fiscal devices sold and installed by PUH HANT.</p>\r\n<p>It is worth emphasising that all the investments made by PUH HANT so far have been financed internally. External financing was limited to loans for working capital.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>PUH HANT has not used the services of any external organisation or institution on strategic matters. Only in late 2008 and 2009, when there were serious problems with delayed payments, the company was assisted by the law firm on strategies for dealing with debtors.</p>\r\n<p>It should be emphasised, however, that to diversify and in changing its business model, the company has been actively working in cooperation with a number of different types of entities, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the Public Employment Office, to organise training for the unemployed in operating cash registers;</li>\r\n<li>the European Social Fund and the Ministry of Economy, who gave subsidies to help with job creation and to participate in trade fairs abroad;</li>\r\n<li>the Chamber of Physicians and the Bar Association, who support training of their members;</li>\r\n<li>Wielkopolska ICT Cluster activities, for example acting as a partner of a conference on the future of internet services, where it provided radio frequency identification (RFID) system support.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The company's restructuring strategy of diversifying and changing its business model, implemented in response to adverse changes in legislation and in the market&rsquo;s evolution should be evaluated very positively. There has been a continued growth in sales, despite a drop in demand in the main area of activity by 75% and the firm has over 2,000 Polish and international clients, many of whom are longstanding. The company has also managed to preserve and strengthen the atmosphere and culture of a family business, with very low staff turnover and high levels of trust and investment in developing the skills of its employees.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Management feels that the company&rsquo;s success is due to long-term planning, rather than rapid and disorganised actions. In practice, this means that the company does not try to win deals and projects at any cost. It prefers to ensure a reasonable margin and quality of traded goods and services. PUH HANT's example proves that quality and reliable service pays off, as customers have no trouble with the tax office and recommend the firm&rsquo;s services. Its plans for the future involve further strengthening the diversification processes in order to achieve a balance between the three main areas of the company's activity.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Radosław Owczarzak, Eurofound</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>Andrzej Kurowski, Co-owner and Director of Marketing and Sales, PUH HANT</p>\r\n<p>Maria Kurowska, Co-owner and Executive Manager, PUH HANT</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company website</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.hant.pl"">www.hant.pl</a></p>"~"Poland"~"46 - wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2033-01-01"
"Recipe Plus, Latvia"~"Recipe Plus, JSC."~"<p>The company supplies medical products to pharmacies, hospitals and other medical and healthcare facilities. Founded in 1995, it has become the leading medicines wholesaler in Latvia. Due to the economic downturn in 2008, the company had to look for new markets in order to preserve its market position. The main aim of the restructuring process was to increase profits, satisfy customer demand and achieve a constant level of sales. Overall, the restructuring had a positive influence on the company.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Recipe Plus JSC is a drugs, medicine and health products wholesaler and distributor. The company supplies medical products to Latvian pharmacies, hospitals and other medical and healthcare facilities. Recipe Plus also handles the export of medicinal products and pre-wholesale processing of medicines and medical goods, as well as delivering medicines and medical and veterinary goods to other wholesalers in Latvia. The company was founded in 1995 and has become the leading medicines wholesaler in Latvia. </p>\r\n<p>The drug wholesale activity of Recipe Plus has two aspects. The main aspect of the business is working with retail pharmacy businesses where the main customers are pharmacies, preventive medicine institutions and hospitals. Recipe Plus has some 7,000 items in its product portfolio. The second aspect of the business is cooperation with the largest pharmaceutical companies in Latvia. In its dealings with both smaller and big customers, the company uses an individual approach, whereby customers are treated individually regardless of size and other characteristics, allowing deferred payments, discounts and so on where necessary.</p>\r\n<p>There are 166 employees working in the company: 93 women and 73 men. The management of Recipe Plus is organised in a single hierarchical system in which one employee is subordinated to another. The firm is headed by the chairman of the board, who is also the owner of the company, and the accounting, legal, marketing and personnel departments, the IT specialists group, and warehouse are under his direct supervision. The advisor to the board is in charge of the purchasing, advertising, customer service, communications and numerical-analytical departments. Procurement managers monitor customer needs and the demand for certain products, identify trends related to changes in orders, and forecast demand for the next working period. The company has no works council or trade union presence. </p>\r\n<p>Recipe Plus has a licence allowing it to produce or repack drugs and also has a GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) certificate, confirming the company’s adherence to GMP requirements. These require a quality approach to manufacturing, enabling companies to minimise or eliminate instances of contamination, mix-ups and errors. The main aim of the company is the expansion of its pharmaceutical wholesale market share in Latvia and the Baltic states.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The main competitive disadvantage of the company was a lack of professionals in the area of procurement. The owner of the company found weaknesses in the negotiations of the management staff over contracts: ‘Managers who were responsible for making delivery agreements were not able perform their work at the necessary level. Sometimes the conditions that we had to accept were terrible. A tangible decrease in the company’s turnover was evident.’ Managers who had to conduct negotiations had been unable to resolve this process satisfactorily. Delivery time was usually too short and prices too high; the company received no privileges and no discounts. Thus, the company had to think about significant changes in this area to save its reputation and, more importantly, to save its profits. </p>\r\n<p>The situation was even more complicated due to the economic downturn, which affected the pharmaceutical industry in similar ways to other industries in Latvia. Even though drugs are considered to be ‘goods of the first necessity’, the economic downturn was not a time when the market accepted just any offer: it became very price-sensitive and many people simply could not afford all drugs they needed. That is why effective work with distributors, in addition to choosing the right product for the right segment and reducing all possible logistics costs in order to keep the selling price as low as possible, became crucial issues. The internal restructuring was implemented to solve these issues.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Similar to other firms in Latvia, Recipe Plus was affected by the economic downturn, and 2008 was challenging for the company. As financial numbers were not as promising as previously, the company had to look for new markets and to seek to preserve its market position. Competition among drug wholesalers in Latvia is tough, yet Recipe Plus managed to maintain leadership in this market segment during the financial downturn. According to the company owner, it was possible due to: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>successfully continuing business as usual through\r\ncooperation with clients, especially with pharmacies;   </li>\r\n<li>expansion of its product portfolio and establishing\r\ncooperation with 15 new producers representing the non-medical and medical\r\nproducts segments;</li>\r\n<li>the introduction of several new approaches to work with\r\nmedical institutions in the field of drug delivery, especially collecting debts;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>consistent maintenance of excellent logistics and\r\ncustomer service quality, shortening delivery times to customers to 24\r\nhours;</li>\r\n<li>ongoing investment in R&amp;D and monitoring of\r\nvarious processes within the company, particularly in logistics, thus achieving\r\nhigh efficiency and fast response to any changes in the market;</li>\r\n<li>the extra visibility arising from the organisation of a\r\nsocial campaign called ‘Bringing joy to Latgale!’, where every\r\npharmacist was asked to take an active part, providing transportation and\r\nlogistical services;</li>\r\n<li>focusing on the minimisation of costs, to keep the\r\nexisting jobs and to proceed to a growth-oriented business.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All these activities were possible due to a successful restructuring process. Restructuring started in October 2008, right after the first problems were noticed, and ended in April 2009. Restructuring was initiated by the company owner as a response to problems arising due to the economic downturn, and the message was clearly communicated to the employees from the very beginning of the restructuring process. Both formal communication channels (such as newsletters) and informal ways of communication (such as meetings) were used for this purpose.</p>\r\n<p>The major aim of the restructuring process was to increase profits, to satisfy customer demand and to make demand more inelastic in order to achieve a constant level of sales. To implement the restructuring process, the company owner initially developed an action plan. According to this plan, the internal restructuring required the creation of a new department, Procurement. With regards to human resources, the key people that implemented the restructuring were employees who were previously responsible for sales and four employees newly hired in the Procurement Department. </p>\r\n<p>The new Procurement Department was supposed to be staffed completely by new professionals. To fill these positions, a special recruitment procedure was organised. Agreements were signed by the most motivated and skilled representatives that could be found within the company as well as professionals from outside. During this process, as initially expected, there was some resistance from the employees that were to be replaced. As the owner of the company puts it, ‘It is simply unnatural to agree that you lack the skills that are necessary for the development of company, especially if you have worked for the company for years.’ </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The major challenge for restructuring was that two people working on procurement procedures at Recipe Plus had to be replaced. According to the owner of the company, it was not an easy decision, since these employees had been working for Recipe Plus for more than three years as procurement managers. They were very familiar with the business and were well informed about existing suppliers and possibilities for further work improvement. Yet, even though   they had a lot of knowledge of the business, they lacked communication and sales skills, which were crucial for successful restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>As Recipe Plus did not want to fire these two employees, the chief executive came up with the idea of creating new positions for them. The main responsibilities of these positions included the collection of information and financial data about competitors and the provision of monthly reports concerning sales issues and turnover; the two employees were particularly suited to these tasks. As the owner of Recipe Plus explains, their salaries remained the same and the main trick was related to psychology: ‘If the person is given a choice of two options, he or she would definitely choose the alternative which is considered to be “better by society.”’ That is, if the title of the position sounds better, it will be filled faster. So he offered them the title of ‘chief analyst’. Surprisingly, they were not much concerned about the wage issues. They received good compensation for lacking the necessary skills.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>No external advice or support was used, as the knowledge that was necessary for the restructuring process was brought into the firm by hiring new people and training existing staff.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The new Procurement Department significantly improved the performance of the company. New professional staff took over responsibility for reaching clients, developing connections between stores and suppliers, and creating the company brand. From the viewpoint of one of the company employees who was directly involved in restructuring process, positive changes became possible due to more attention being paid to the information resources. The whole process of acquiring market information, communicating and analysing the information, and using it to make business decisions was reviewed. Training of employees (paid by the company) was implemented, paying particular attention to communication and sales skills. Elements of good teamwork and delegation of responsibilities were also addressed, and all this resulted in a positive effect on net profits. </p>\r\n<p>Overall, the restructuring had a positive influence on the company. In fact, the company has already decided to use this positive experience in the future by further expanding the Procurement Department. According to the owner of the company, ‘this should not only help increase profits but also ensure better competitive advantage for Recipe Plus’. </p>\r\n<p>Below, some calculations are provided that show the efficiency of the restructuring process (see Table 1).</p>\r\n\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<CAPTION>Table 1: Net profit margin, 2008–2010</CAPTION>\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""39.70%"">\r\n      <COL width=""18.10%"">\r\n      <COL width=""20.00%"">\r\n      <COL width=""21.80%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n </TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2008</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2009</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2010</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Net profit (LVL)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>5,326,438</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>6,000,987</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>5,476,134</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Net sales (LVL)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>87,307,977</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>95,755,351</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>87,561,419</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Net profit margin (net profit/net sales) </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>6.10%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>6.27%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>6.25%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p><i>Note: LVL = Latvian lats</i></p>\r\n<p><i>Source: Recipe Plus</i></p>\r\n<p>Comparing three years starting with 2008, the net profit margin is much higher in 2009 than in 2008. It reduced slightly in 2010, but overall the share of net profit in turnover is stable. In 2010, net profit was 6.25% of turnover.</p>\r\n<p>Net profit margin figures, however, do not provide sufficient information for estimating profitability. It reflects both profits from the sales of goods and services, and costs and benefits not directly related to sales (such as interest paid and received and accrued taxes), which are outside of managers’ control.</p>\r\n<p>The gross profit margin assesses cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales (Table 2). This ratio estimates how well the company controls the cost of its inventory and the manufacturing of its products and then passes on the costs to its customers. This indicator also reflects the changes in pricing policy and the company’s ability to control the cost of goods sold. The development of the factor dynamics indicatormay indicate a need to revise its prices or strengthen the control of inventory production. </p>\r\n\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<CAPTION>Table 2: Gross profit margin, 2008–2010</CAPTION>\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""33.10%"">\r\n      <COL width=""22.10%"">\r\n      <COL width=""22.10%"">\r\n      <COL width=""22.10%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n </TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2008</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2009</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2010</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Gross profit (LVL)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>7,101,918</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>8,001,316</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>7,301,512</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Net sales (LVL)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>87,307,977</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>95,755,351</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>87,561,419</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Gross profit margin (gross profit/net sales)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>8.13%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>8.36%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>8.34%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p><i>Note: LVL = Latvian lats</i></p>\r\n<p><i>Source: Recipe Plus</i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Gross profit margin increased in 2010 compared with 2008, which indicates that all actions related to the restructuring process and the process itself improved the efficiency of Recipe Plus. So, overall, the financial data depicts the positive influence of the internal restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>Yet, as usually happens, many activities were implemented in order to achieve positive financial figures. The main ones are as follows. First of all, the variety of goods offered by Recipe Plus increased as a result of restructuring. Due to better communication and sales skills, the company was able to work more professionally with both local and international customers and suppliers, and that has resulted in a more diverse product portfolio. Thus, the increase in profits was very much fostered by an increase in sales that, in turn, resulted from the increase in the variety of products that Recipe Plus offers. Furthermore, as explained by the owner, ‘Sales managers became better at finding suppliers that could offer better prices, thus we could offer more affordable products to our customers.’ Recipe Plus also became more favoured in the market; the owner explains, ‘Customer trust depends on the quality and diversity of products. As soon as the company becomes a provider of cheaper and differentiated products, it starts to win over the market. If we add a marketing element, the firm simply starts winning the market, leaving the competitors far behind.’</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Recipe Plus had various issues that had to be solved if the company was to remain in the market, especially after the economic downturn. The most important issues, however, were related to the people that directly influence the price of the product. As the company owner reflected, during the rapid economic growth that Latvia enjoyed before the downturn in 2008, many companies, including Recipe Plus, simply forgot how to work effectively and had to relearn this skill as fast as possible when the crisis came. This is easier done in a small business than in a big one, where changes usually take longer. As Recipe Plus is in the SME category, it might be interesting to compare how the same problem would be solved in a large company. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Anastasija Matvejeva, Volha Holub and Vladislav Zaitev</p>\r\n<p>(edited by Arnis Sauka)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>Interviews with the owner and an employee of Recipe Plus</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Latvia"~"46 - wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2011-12-17"

The firm offers everything from instructing beginners, sprint races, children’s races, a women’s cup and races for older cyclists.</p>\r\n<p>The company hires race courses, and prepares and organises the races (dealing, for example, with the registration of participants and instructions on the race course) and conducts them (including scoring and awarding prizes, but also technical support and medical emergency services) (Heinen et al., 2005). They also store motorbikes between events and transport them, on demand, to a race course, as well as doing minor maintenance and servicing.</p>\r\n<p>Karl Rehm, the company’s owner and manager, trained as a motor mechanic with master craftsman certification, and then spent 17 years building up a company trading in motorbikes. During this time he started organising race training, first informally, and then making it a feature of his company. In 2001, the huge success of these events prompted him, after doing a qualification in business administration, to focus his business exclusively on organising race training and to sell his motorbike business.</p>\r\n<p>Since 2009, Rehm Race Days has employed him, his wife and one full-time employee. Karl Rehm runs his events using local people who can participate in the race training for free in exchange for their support in getting ready, clearing up, monitoring and general organisation.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the low number of employees, there is no works council or relationship with a trade union in the company (as in the initial motorbike trading company).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>At the end of the 1980s, Karl Rehm, an enthusiastic motorbike rider began to look into how he could have a go on race courses as an amateur. He soon discovered that this was not possible. However, on the assumption that there were many enthusiasts just like him, he decided to rent a course himself and organise race training for his customers and fellow members at his motorbike club. The first day he organised was such a success that it became an annual, and increasingly popular, event.</p>\r\n<p>After some time, it became obvious that the race days could be the basis for a business. He suggested to other motorbike traders that they and their customers could also participate, which resulted in an increased awareness about the events which, at this point, were organised alongside his other activities in his motorbike business.</p>\r\n<p>In 2001, the organisation of the days became so time-consuming, and involved so much travel, that Karl no longer had the time to deal with the customers or administrative tasks in this initial business, in spite of the good support of his employees. He tried to fulfil his business obligations by working evenings, weekends and on public holidays, which increased his stress levels and resulted in a situation where he hardly had any spare time.</p>\r\n<p>The motorbike trade is strongly competitive. Margins are tight because product differentiation is hardly possible, customers compare prices on the internet and are willing to travel to the cheapest offer. Traders must invest a lot of capital, with the result that a decent profit is possible only if a company owner puts in a lot of work and personal engagement.</p>\r\n<p>The motorbike trade is also seasonal, but organising race events is much more evenly distributed across the year as during the winter events can be organised in southern Europe, or motorbikes can be prepared for the next season. Furthermore, Karl Rehm discovered that one particularly popular event could bring in a profit equal to the annual profit of his motorbike business. </p>\r\n<p>To begin with, he had hardly any competition. There is only a limited number of potential race dates, and he benefited from his longstanding contacts with the owners of the race courses, giving him access to more dates than any of the other organisers who began to spring up. Consequently, Karl Rehm decided to sell his motorbike retail business and concentrate exclusively on organising races.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s organising the race days was more like a hobby. However, In 1999, after Karl Rehm qualified in business administration in the skilled trades, he began to consider his idea in a more strategic and entrepreneurial way. One of his lecturers told him about a public support programme called ‘innovative ideas in the craft sector’ and encouraged him to participate. Under the programme he drafted a business plan and a market analysis (including an assessment of the future potential) for the business idea. This took about six to nine months. The positive results of the analysis encouraged him to spend increasing time and effort in organising events. However, it soon became obvious to him that this was at the expense of his motorbike trade as both activities depended much on his personal involvement. He did not want to let down his customers and therefore realised that he had to decide which of the two business models to continue. Due to the more promising future economic potential of the race trainings and his personal interest in this new challenge, he decided to sell the motorbike business.</p>\r\n<p>At this point, Karl Rehm’s company employed four workers, including his sister. He suggested that one of his top mechanics could become his successor, but the man in question rejected the idea and left the company. However, his replacement agreed to take over the company after one year. The technical details of the transfer were clarified and agreed, and the employees were informed accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>However, in autumn 2000 when the sale was meant to be finalised, the buyer had to pull out as his family withdrew their promised financial support.</p>\r\n<p>Karl Rehm then contacted other local companies to see if they were interested in buying the company. It took him two months to find somebody who, for example, was also accepted by banks and business partners. It was particularly important for Karl Rehm that the business continued as before, with clients knowing they would get continued good service, and the firm’s employees keeping their jobs. </p>\r\n<p>The new owner was a car dealer and the company was moved to a new site, six kilometres away, where its business has continued successfully. Karl Rehm did not need any additional staff in the early phase of organising the race days and therefore could not offer his workers a job in his new firm. Instead, all the workers were transferred with the old company to the car dealership, under the same terms and conditions. The only exception was the employee who had hoped to buy the company. There was no need for him at the car dealer’s, but Karl Rehm found him a job at a company owned by one of his friends, where he is still working, as a customer relations manager. Karl Rehm still keeps in touch with his previous employees and the car dealer.</p>\r\n<p>Karl Rehm says the actual transfer process was easy. Due to his time in the business and his contacts with other traders he succeeded in selling all his stock before the transfer. Furthermore, he contacted the motorbike manufacturers whose bikes he sold and asked if he could transfer his contracts to the successor company. His main business partners, after checking the successor out, agreed to cooperate. However he did have a bad experience with one manufacturer. This happened when he found somebody interested in taking over a trade contract and then mediated between this person and the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer bypassed Karl Rehm and concluded a new contract with the interested party. This meant Karl Rehm had to terminate his own contract without financial compensation.</p>\r\n<p>The whole transfer process took about two years, involving bank meetings, re-registration of the motorbike trading company, cancellation of the insurance, registration with the local community administration. However, it was a continuous, reasonably stress-free process.</p>\r\n<p>Karl Rehm’s new company has become very successful, and could still be expanded. Its services have been extended from organising race days to storage, transport and carrying out small repairs to customers’ motorbikes. This has enabled him to take on an additional employee. The company also bought a new company building in which the customers’ motorbikes and the trucks used to transport them are stored between race days.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenge in the transfer process was to find a new successor quickly when the expected successor pulled out. Also Karl Rehm’s projected financial take from the deal was hit when a manufacturer sidelined him over a contract.</p>\r\n<p>Another difficulty was the emotional cost of selling the company, which he had founded and successfully run for 17 years. However, he was persuaded by a friend, himself an entrepreneur, of the better business potential of organising race training compared to the motorbike trade as well as the effects on his own health and work-life-balance (impossibility to run both business activities).</p>\r\n<p>Karl Rehm encountered many problems while developing his new business. It was a very specific, new activity for which standard products could not be used. For example, available software for inventory control and merchandise management was not suitable for administering the race days, nor could the standardised line-ups for transporting motorbikes be used. In such cases, Karl Rehm himself, in cooperation with specialists, developed the products he needed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The main reasons that Karl Rehm began to approach the idea of organising race days in a more strategic way were encouragement from his lecturer and participation in the support programme.</p>\r\n<p>He was supported while preparing to diversify, and during the transfer process, by his entrepreneur friend, who gave him emotional and personal support as well as practical recommendations and helped him to search for and contact suitable successors. This friend started up his business, expanded it to about 300 employees to date and also changed his business focus during his entrepreneurial activities</p>\r\n<p>Karl Rehm feels that, as an entrepreneur, it is important to find one’s own solutions to challenges, rather than asking for help from public bodies or lobbying organisations. For this reason he did not look for such support during the restructuring process.</p>\r\n<p>To clarify specific questions, for example regarding legal or tax issues or concerning specific procedures concerning the transfer, he approached his tax consultant, with whom he had a long business relationship, which still exists.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The motorbike trading company is still being successfully run since the transfer, with Karl Rehm’s old customers benefiting from a known and trusted service, and all the workers being kept on. Although the company was relocated, this did not cause any inconveniences for the employees as the new location is only six kilometres away.</p>\r\n<p>Karl Rehm’s new company is prospering, making higher profits at a lower risk (due to lower capital employed) than his motorbike trade. There is less competition than in the motorbike trade and a good and sustainable level of demand. Due to the good business performance and continuous expansion an additional job was created..</p>\r\n<p>The enterprises that cooperate with the new company, such as motorbike dealers or garages offering their customers the chance to participate in the race days, benefit from higher customer loyalty and increased demand for servicing and such products as tyres,  cover panels, high-value vehicle mechanics, etc. (Heinen et al., 2005).</p>\r\n<p>Karl Rehm is convinced he made the right decision and is still satisfied with the re-orientation of his business activities.  He is continuously on the lookout for new race courses and customer groups and appreciates the challenge to develop new business.</p>\r\n<p>His experience has given him a more strategic perspective towards his ideas, and he increasingly conducts analyses of the market and potential ideas. As a consequence he might decide not to pursue with ideas that appeal to him personally if they prove not to be economically feasible.</p>\r\n<p>The switch has improved his work-life balance. Although his workload is the same, he has more flexibility in setting his working times because of fewer customer contacts.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>One of the major reasons for Karl Rehm to turn the organisation of race training into a business was his participation in a support programme. This meant that he first had to spend time doing strategic considerations and elaborating data and facts (market analysis and assessment of future potential). He sees the economic outlook of his forecast as an important success factor for the restructuring, and since then also increasingly applies such criteria when considering further business ideas. He now gives more importance to the acquisition of knowledge and information on business issues.</p>\r\n<p>The decision to sell his long-established motorbike business, as well as going through the actual transfer process was mainly supported by a friend who is also an entrepreneur. Karl Rehm did not see any need for support from public bodies or lobbying organisations as he feels that he alone is responsible for his entrepreneurial decisions and challenges and does not want to outsource this responsibility.</p>\r\n<p>It was important to him that the company he had founded and successfully established should continue and not only maintain the jobs of his employees but also guarantee to long-standing customers that they would get the quality of service they had come to expect. He has committed himself  personally to ensuring this. He points to the major success factors for his restructuring as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the proactive and strategic approach in getting\r\ninformation and developing his own knowledge, as well as the drafting of the\r\nbusiness plan and the market analysis</li>\r\n<li>his personal interest in the business activity, his own\r\ninitiative and engagement when realising the ideas</li>\r\n<li>personal support from a friend, particularly as this also\r\nincluded entrepreneurial/business administration advice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Irene Mandl, Eurofound</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><b>Interview </b></p>\r\n<p>Karl Rehm, Owner and manager, Rehm race days</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p> <a HREF=""http://www.rehmracedays.de/"">http://www.rehmracedays.de/</a> (visited 10 November 2011)</p>\r\n<p>Heinen, E., Ritter, A.

"Samat Kovoizospol, Slovakia"~"Samat Kovoizospol s.r.o."~"<p>This Slovakian company produces aluminium window frames and other construction parts and has an international customer base, with 80% of its overall production being exported. The aim of the complex restructuring was the implementation of new technology and innovative production process of fibreglass window frames. While the company has experienced financial problems due to the recent global economic crisis, its ability to innovate and compete has helped it to give it a competitive edge.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Jan Pauschek is the founder and sole owner of Samat Kovoizospol, s.r.o. The business is a limited liability company, and the owner is also the managing director. Despite its ownership structure, the company is a family business employing other family members, including Mr. Pauschek’s wife and children. Mrs Pauschek, who was interviewed for this case study, is employed at Samat Kovoizospol as an economist. She joined the company at its inception, and in her management capacity makes important decisions concerning company operations.  The family members constitute the core of the firm’s management, including its economic, production and technology-related functions.</p>\r\n<p>Jan Pauschek started his first venture in 1988 by establishing Kovoizospol as a cooperative. This was the only way to run any entrepreneurial venture under the socialist regime in what was then Czechoslovakia. Kovoizospol produced metal structures and roof hydro-isolations. Using his experience and contacts with clients, the owner was able to follow new trends in the construction industry.</p>\r\n<p>In 1992, Kovoizospol created a joint venture with the Italian producing and trading company Samat Aluminio, whose main products were aluminium and aluminium profiles. The limited liability company Samat Kovoizospol was then established, with production facilities located in several garages in a suburb of Bratislava. When its production increased, the company moved to a more spacious production facility in Čunovo, outside Bratislava. Later on, the company started production also in High Tatras, mainly due to intensive construction activities in this region and to be closer to customers. In 2006, Mr Pauschek bought his partner’s share and became the sole owner.</p>\r\n<p>The company produces aluminium window frames and other construction components for buildings, including plastic window frames, where demanded by customers. Its customers range from individuals to large construction companies. Samat Kovoizospol has extensive international contacts with its suppliers in China, which supply the highest quality raw materials, as well as with its customers, exporting to EU countries, mainly France, the Czech Republic and Belgium. It exports also to Russia, Egypt, Vietnam and China. Around 80% of overall production is exported.</p>\r\n<p>Samat Kvoizospol constantly monitors the newest construction trends and innovations. In 2005, it started production of fibreglass profiles for the construction industry. In 2006, the company acquired a large site in Miloslavovo, where it built a new production facility for a new fibreglass technology. In 2007, it decided to buy a Canadian patent for the production of pultruded fibreglass profiles. The mechanical and thermal isolation characteristics of this material make it an excellent construction material for window frames. It eliminates the need for metal reinforcement structures regularly used in plastic windows. Additional advantages are stability, long-lasting durability and smooth surface.</p>\r\n<p>Even though the price of fibreglass is about 20% higher than plastic, fibreglass is much cheaper than aluminium window frames. This makes it a very competitive product, and it is becoming better known by prospective customers. Due to patent protection, Samat Kovoizospol has no competitors in Slovakia or in Europe. There is no mass production of window frames, all business being based on specific customer orders. Production runs  are short, which makes management of production quite demanding. Nevertheless, it provides jobs for about 40 employees. This level is quite sustainable despite the recent crisis in the construction sector and financial difficulties of the firm.</p>\r\n<p>The company does not have any relationships with trade unions nor a works council present.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process of Samat Kovoizospol has been quite complex. The company has always tried to innovate to increase its competitiveness. Developing steadily from the start, it soon prospered in terms of performance and employment. When it found a new technology that was able to compete in terms of mechanical and thermal characteristics with aluminium window profiles and which offered considerably lower production costs, the company decided to use it. They bought the patent and implemented the new technology. To do this, the company needed large investments covered by bank loans. </p>\r\n<p>With the new technology in place, Samat Kovoizospol became the only company in Europe able to produce pultruded fibreglass profiles and hence substantially increased its competitiveness. Under stable market conditions during the planning phase, the innovation project would have proceeded without any substantial problems. However, the onset of the economic crisis hit the construction industry particularly hard, and the loss of a large contract resulted in a cash flow problem and insolvency.</p>\r\n<p>Problems arose in 2007 when the company lost a large contract in Prague that should have lasted for five years. The reason for this was a late shipment of new technology related to the patent for fibreglass profiles from Canada. For Samat Kovoizospol, it was impossible to replace such a big contract by new orders of a comparable size immediately, especially when the emerging crisis was already affecting the whole construction industry. It was necessary to look for new customers. This had a negative impact on cash flow and repayment of bank loans.</p>\r\n<p>However, the events that triggered real financial difficulty for the company were the insolvency of one English customer and a Slovak company in 2008, when Samat Kovoizospol had not received payments for large deliveries to them. The company was in a state of failure, as it had a number of creditors and was unable to discharge its liabilities to them within 30 days. </p>\r\n<p>The Act on Bankruptcy and Restructuring in Slovakia defines failure as when a business becomes insolvent and cannot pay creditors (in other words, where a debtor is more than 30 days late in paying what is owed), and it has more than one creditor, and the value of the amount due exceeds its asset value. In the case of a debtor becoming insolvent, the procedures for the administration of this event are bankruptcy or restructuring. Bankruptcy means the liquidation of the company and the lay-off of all employees. Restructuring (<i>reštrukturalizácia</i>) is a legal process whereby the debtor will continue operations in the hope that it recovers and creditors can write off part of their claims, as it is in their interest to do so. </p>\r\n<p>As with bankruptcy, both creditors and debtor can apply for restructuring, and the debtor can appoint a bankruptcy trustee (<i>správca konkurznej podstaty</i>) to assess whether restructuring is possible. The trustee is a physical or a legal person listed under the Register of Bankruptcy Trustees of the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic. The role of the trustee is to assist the courts in the process of bankruptcy and restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>If the trustee recommends restructuring, the debtor may apply for a restructuring permit. The assessment must not be more than 30 days old. The restructuring procedure begins with publication in the trade journal. Only those creditors who have registered their claims on time through a declaration are entitled to make claims during restructuring. The declaration, together with attachments, is submitted to the office of the trustee, and to the court. The declaration must be received by both the trustee and the court within 30 days of the restructuring permit being issued. A list of registered claims is drawn up by the trustee under court supervision. The restructuring procedure ends with the publication of a court resolution on the completion of restructuring in the trade journal.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>To avoid bankruptcy, Samat Kovoizospol appointed a consulting company to assess whether restructuring was possible and to propose the best plan to convince and satisfy creditors. This is a common practice in Slovakia, and there is an entire market in consultancy firms that offer their services to help facilitate restructuring. Thorough analysis showed that the company had the potential to overcome its difficulties. The company had production capacity and there was market for fibreglass window frames. As a result of discussions with the consultancy, the company decided to apply for restructuring and managed to get an agreement from its creditors. </p>\r\n<p>The company started to communicate with its creditors about the situation concerning its financial problems. At this stage, the creditors authorised a trustee to make a restructuring assessment, to find out if the conditions for debtor’s restructuring had been met. The outcome of the assessment, which could not be older than 30 days, was a recommendation for restructuring and the assessment of the debtor’s economic status. </p>\r\n<p>Based on the trustee’s recommendation, it was possible to submit the request to permit restructuring to the relevant court. The court ruling on commencement of the restructuring process was issued on 6 July 2010. At this stage, the court reviews the formal essentials of submitted motion for restructuring. The issuing of a ruling on commencement of the restructuring process has protective effects against further aggressive activities by creditors.</p>\r\n<p>The company in cooperation with the trustee and the committee of main creditors developed the restructuring plan. The plan states how, when and what amount would be covered in claims of eligible creditors. Accordingly, the court ordered that the repayments be made to creditors every six months. The debt of a company that undergoes restructuring can be written off by as much as 85%. The company plans to cover the repayment by increasing their production and sales; the investments made in recent years to introduce fibreglass products potentially have made Samat Kovoizospol highly competitive. In addition, the plan regulates monitoring of the company operation and important decisions with financial effects. This plan was approved by the court on 3 May 2011. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The whole process of restructuring has been very challenging for the company. Above all, it was difficult work to convince the main creditors about the realistic prospects for company operations in the market and its ability to pay creditors’ claims agreed in the restructuring plan. After the approval of the restructuring plan prepared by the trustee and creditors, a plan must be endorsed by the court. In this case, the restructuring plan was developed for the duration of eight years. During this period, the company’s financial operations will be thoroughly monitored to ensure fulfilment of the restructuring plan. The company will be prevented from obtaining a bank loan for a large project during this time. The business will have to look for smaller projects that are less lucrative, and its new production capacities will not be used as efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>In this case, the consulting company was an important factor in managing the restructuring process successfully. The assessment of the company’s potential to restructure and the restructuring plan are the key documents in the process of restructuring. These can only be produced by the registered trustee. However, the assessment involved lawyers as well as economists from business consultancies, who provided a full analysis of the company’s financial situation. They helped with the development of a comprehensive assessment document and the successful implementation of restructuring. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main outcome of restructuring was the implementation of new technology and mastering of the whole innovative production process of fibreglass window frames. However, such financial restructuring presented difficulties for the company. Despite the partial reduction of debts, there will be ongoing monitoring of financial operations to eliminate the possibility of the accumulation of excessive debts. During this period, it will be almost impossible to get a bank loan. It means that Samat Kovoizospol cannot take on any large projects and the opportunities to gain new customers are restricted. Nevertheless, the outcome of restructuring has been a success in terms of allowing the company to continue in its production activities. Due to innovative technologies, competitiveness, excellent position in the market and good relationships with suppliers and customers, the company is able to maintain production levels and the number of employees. Restructuring did not have any effect on the existing staff numbers. </p>\r\n<p>According to Mrs Pauschek, the restructuring event was very demanding for the company and for her personally. The financial performance of the company was a central issue in the deliberations and decisions made during restructuring. On the other hand, the company is a family business, and this adds additional pressure, such as working longer hours, on all family members who are involved. Mr Pauschek said he felt he had aged by 10 years as a result of the whole process. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Samat Kovoizospol is a successful construction company that constantly innovates in its product range. In 2005, the company introduced fibreglass products as an alternative to plastic and aluminium. As the only company in Slovakia producing fibreglass window frames, Samat Kovoizospol has no competition. This places the company in a favourable position. </p>\r\n<p>The company has experienced financial problems due to the recent global economic crisis; however, its ability to innovate and compete has helped it to continue in operation despite the problems in the construction sector. The possibility of the legal process of restructuring that is available in Slovakia has helped the company avoid bankruptcy and continue its activities without making cuts to employment or production. As a consequence of restructuring, the company is restricted in terms of business expansion; however, it has lowered its debts and continues producing. In these difficult times, the company will need to make a huge managerial effort to keep performing and provide employment for its staff.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Juraj Poledna, Peritus</p>\r\n<p>Eva Kasperova, Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Jan Pauschek, owner and CEO</p>\r\n<p>Mrs Pauschek, economic director</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Samat Kovoizospol, s.r.o.</p>\r\n<p>Ľanová 6</p>\r\n<p>82101 Bratislava</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company website </h3>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.samat.sk/"">http://www.samat.sk/</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Slovakia"~"25 - manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"(avoiding) bankruptcy"~"2011-12-12"
"Sanako, Finland"~"Sanako Corporation"~"<p>The restructuring in Finnish digital language lab company Sanako was aimed at reorganising its business functions and diversifying its product portfolio. Despite the redundancies which were a necessary part of the cost-cutting process, the CEO has put in place a remuneration system to motivate current employees towards the development of the company, with 15%–30% of the company’s profits to be shared among the employees.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Sanako Corporation is a company that develops language learning solutions. Sanako’s products and services include software and hardware-based digital language labs for classrooms, cloud-based solutions for virtual environments, flexible content integration and training modules, as well as consultation. The aim of the company is to enable language learners to speak  and understand language better and to have good communication skills. Sanako’s history dates back to 1961, when the first Tandberg language lab was produced. During the 1960s and 1970s, Tandberg grew and became the global leader in language labs. The educational division of the company was acquired by Teleste Corporation in 1984. In 2003, Sanako was born as a spin-off of Teleste. </p>\r\n<p>Sanako operates internationally. The company has two offices in Finland: in Espoo and its headquarters in Turku. In addition, it has subsidiaries in India, the UK and the USA, and representation offices in China, Dubai and Mexico. Sales also take place via a worldwide partner network. The markets are divided rather evenly across Europe, Asia, and North and South America. Only 2% of Sanako’s sales come from Finland.</p>\r\n<p>The company employed 48 people in March 2012. About 25 employees work in Finland and the rest abroad; 90% are male and 10% female. Women work mostly in finance and administration and men in product development and sales. Most of the employees have a higher education degree (bachelor’s or master’s), typically in engineering or business.</p>\r\n<p>The current CEO Tobias Elgh joined Sanako in June 2011 as sales director. In September 2011, he was promoted to CEO after the growth strategy of the company had failed. Elgh’s task was to make the company profitable again and put it back on the path to growth. Sanako is privately owned, with equity investment from a group of varied investors. The CEO does not own any shares in the company.</p>\r\n<p>There is no works council present in the company, but there are two shop stewards representing the employees. The shop stewards serve as local negotiators, conciliators and channels of communication between the employer and the employees. Shop stewards have been involved in the restructuring procedures related to dismissals (codetermination negotiations). This is required by the Act on Cooperation within Undertakings (or YT Act) applied in all businesses with a regular staff of at least 20 employees in Finland. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Sales as well as the profitability of the company decreased greatly during the global financial and economic crisis. Neither Asian nor European markets maintained the demand Sanako expected. The political situation in certain countries also had a direct influence on Sanako’s business where they were selling to ministries of education. For example, the company expected to have major projects from Egypt and Libya, but due to the unstable situations in these countries no deals were made. At the same time, Sanako’s focus shifted from hardware to software, which in turn decreased the price per sale. Therefore, bigger projects became even more important for the company. The CEO considers it impossible for the company to grow with their current offering. There has been a declining trend in the sales of hardware-based digital language labs. If not enough compensating products are offered, sales growth is impossible. </p>\r\n<p>The turnover of the company had remained reasonably stable, at a level of €10–11 million, from 2005, but in 2011, turnover dropped to €7.8 million. At the same time, fixed costs increased to €7.5 million. The first unprofitable year in company’s history was 2010, and 2011 was even worse. The whole company was built for growth, and it had expected to grow by 40% from 2010, resulting in a turnover of €40 million by 2014. Many investments in new markets were made, and new employees were recruited (resulting in the increase of fixed costs), but growth did not ensue. In order to improve the cost-efficiency and create more synergies, the restructuring process was started.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring in Sanako is related to reorganisation of its business functions and product portfolio. Previously, the sales and marketing organisations were located around the world. There were two sales organisations, one for projects and one for ‘normal’ sales. Projects refer to custom projects done jointly with national governments and ministries of education, where Sanako takes care of planning, financing, installation, user training and support. Normal sales refer to smaller-scale sales of the company’s products. Each subsidiary and representation office was responsible for its own marketing. To achieve greater cost efficiency and to promote more synergies, these activities, along with financial services, have been integrated and are currently centralised in Finland. A service centre has been created in Finland, which serves the subsidiaries and partners abroad. Previously independent subsidiaries are now operating as sales companies. Centralising the financial administration and sales and marketing organisations in Finland was done during 2011. The business operations of Sanako are now reorganised into three functions: 1) business services (financial department and back office), 2) product and service production, and 3) sales and marketing. </p>\r\n<p>Product development has always been led by Sanako headquarters, but reorganisation has also taken place there. Some product portfolios have been terminated, and due to this, some employees have been let go. The focus has been directed towards the development of new products in the form of cloud-based services. This will change the revenue generation model of the company. Whereas customers previously paid once for the hardware, they are now paying annually for services. The old products are currently in maintenance mode; as long as they are selling, they are kept in the product portfolio. The aim is to launch three to six new services per year. The company has a separate unit of product designers, who are responsible for designing new products and services. Within three to five years, the company should have found a service that can replace the hardware-based language labs, as they are coming to the end of their life cycle. The renewal of the product portfolio started at the end of 2010 and should be finished by the end of 2012.</p>\r\n<p>Cutting all kinds of costs has been central in the restructuring done in Sanako to build a healthy basis for the business in the future and to make the company profitable by the end of 2012. All cost items have been reviewed and even small costs are cut. One example of this is ending coffee machine rental. In addition, the number of management team members has been cut from nine to three. All the former members of management left the company, so the current management team consists entirely of ‘fresh’ faces.  </p>\r\n<p>The biggest cost-saving was made from redundancies. The management also looked at options to make some working time adjustments, such as short-time working and compulsory paid leave, but these were not considered sufficient. The company had two codetermination negotiations resulting in lay-offs, the first in September–October 2011 and the second at the turn of 2011–2012. The process was carried out according to the regulations of the Act on Cooperation within Undertakings. The shop stewards represented the employees’ side in the negotiations. According to the interviewed employee, the first negotiations were tougher as it was the first time for all parties involved. There were meetings every few days. The second time, the process was much faster (the minimum time was two weeks as the number of people dismissed was fewer than ten). At the time of the second codetermination negotiations, the new collective agreement took effect. An across-the-board increase of 2.4% in salaries, a standard annual raise varying slightly in size, was included in the agreement. There was a possibility to negotiate a lower increase or no increase at all, but the employees did not accept the offers made by the employer. </p>\r\n<p>One alternative to the restructuring was outsourcing the financial administration. A proposal was requested, but it was impossible to implement it in the timeframe set by the board, that is, by the end of 2011. The CEO also considered selling one of the product portfolios that had been profitable for the company and making the company solely a software business. Both of these options are still possible. However, currently the focus is on stabilising the business and gaining back the trust of the employees.</p>\r\n<p>The CEO has had the main responsibility for the costs savings and strategic renewal. The CEO examined all functions thoroughly and interviewed employees all around the world to get to know the company and to identify the functions where savings could be made. He also listened to employees’ suggestions for potential cost savings. Employees were encouraged to share their views in meetings and via e-mails. After that, the CEO made a written proposal regarding cost savings to the board, which accepted it. The employees were informed of the codetermination negotiations a week before the negotiations started, following the YT Act. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The biggest challenge was related to change management. The news about the dismissals was a shock to the employees. It was the first time they had experienced such an event, and they did not know what exactly was going on. As the codetermination negotiations affected the whole staff, there was huge uncertainty about future employment among the employees. The lay-offs had a crippling effect on employees’ performance for a long time after the decisions were made. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The CEO has had the main responsibility for the costs savings and strategic renewal, but he has worked closely with the board and has been able to share ideas with the members. The CEO’s own support network, mainly his friends, relatives and other business contacts, has also been important. No financial or non-financial support has been received for the restructuring. The CEO considers that this is partly because there is not enough information about available support for SMEs. The company has received financing from Tekes (the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation) for development of the service business, but this support is applied continuously and it is not directly related to the restructuring.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>As a result of the restructuring, the company aims to reach a turnover of €9.8 million in 2012 and cut fixed costs to €5 million. Before the restructuring, the company had around 74 employees, and of these, 26 were let go; 60% of the lay-offs took place in Finland and 40% abroad. In Finland, employees in all roles were let go, whereas abroad employees were reduced from marketing. There is still potential to reduce employees in India or China. The company now operates on quarter-year basis, and if the budget is not balanced, new restructuring will be considered, but mainly in the units abroad.</p>\r\n<p>When the announcement of the first codetermination negotiations was given in September 2011, the reactions of employees were mainly disbelief, anger and fear for their jobs. Sanako had been considered a stable workplace, and the communication from the former management team had not given any clear indication about the company’s problems. In the beginning, there was a confrontation between the employees and the employer. The second time was easier, but the employees still found it very hard to believe: ‘Wasn’t the first time enough?’ </p>\r\n<p>The current management has paid a great deal of attention to open communication with the personnel. Monthly meetings are organised, where topics such as sales development and cost levels are presented. Regular e-mail notifications are sent to inform the personnel about topical issues. This is important as the management team is in Espoo, although they visit the headquarters every week.</p>\r\n<p>The trade unions have been informed about the restructuring via the shop stewards. Also the reseller network has been informed, as quite a few of the contact persons changed in the process. </p>\r\n<p>The CEO has reviewed all the tasks of each employee in order to better know the company and to see if everyone is doing relevant tasks. As a result, the responsibilities of five employees have been widened. Three people have received a small increase in salary. One person agreed to have a pay cut. It has not been possible to offer any training to the employees. This is unfortunate, as training is needed in the company, but the company cannot afford it. </p>\r\n<p>At first there was some confusion about the roles and responsibilities of each person. When interviewed early in 2012, the CEO believed that it would be a year of getting used to the new ways of working. The interviewed employee considered the expanded job descriptions to be positive for career development, even though that has not been possible for all employees. The workload has increased for everyone, with the same amount of work having to be done by fewer people. </p>\r\n<p>It is too early yet to know if the restructuring will lead to burnout, but the workload and stress levels have been high, especially among employees in financial administration. The codetermination negotiations happened simultaneously with the financial reporting of the company.</p>\r\n<p>The employees have also been able to suggest costs savings. This has been a good way to motivate people and to improve the work atmosphere. One idea suggested by the employees was to get rid of the extra office space in the headquarters after the lay-offs. The previous office space of 1,000 square metres has now been reduced to 500. Moving to new workstations acted as a symbolic new start for the business that has been built by all the employees jointly. Also a remuneration system has been developed to motivate the employees towards the development of the company, and 15%–30% of the company profits will be shared among the employees.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process has been a great learning process, although a very tough one, for the CEO. He came to the company to grow the sales and ended up addressing totally different tasks. As he was quite new in the company, it may have been easier for him to make rational and more analytical decisions, because he was not yet that emotionally attached to the people in the company. </p>\r\n<p>Even though the restructuring process is still ongoing (the renewal of the product portfolio) and all the decisions were made quite rapidly, the CEO considers the outcomes positive for company profitability and also for the personnel. Costs have decreased, and sales have started increase compared to last year. The CEO says he has received positive feedback from the employees. Everybody understands now that the restructuring was necessary, although painful, to keep the company alive. The interviewed employee states that the current atmosphere in the company is reasonably good and the company feels strong. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>SMEs are able to react faster to changes in the markets, but sometimes it can be hard to find the best people to implement a restructuring plan, as there are not that many people to choose from. Not all employees are able to act as change agents in the company. </p>\r\n<p>The CEO of Sanako recommends other SMEs going through restructuring to carefully follow market trends and to react to them. It is important to analyse rationally the strengths and the weaknesses of the business and try to turn the weaknesses into strengths. He considers that if a company is not profitable, something needs to be done, and the sooner the better. </p>\r\n<p>A personnel matrix recording the strengths and weaknesses of each employee is a useful tool for restructuring. It makes it easier to find a back-up person for each employee and to transfer employees from one task to another when needed. This is especially important if the company has gone through codetermination negotiations, as they are not allowed to recruit new employees for nine months after the negotiations.</p>\r\n<p>The public support available for SME restructuring should be promoted more. It should also be easily accessible because in a time of crisis, SMEs do not have extra time to spend on the application procedures. Restructuring often demands cost savings and, therefore, support must not be expensive. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Elisa Akola, TSE Entre, Turku School of Economics, University of Turku</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Tobias Elgh, CEO of Sanako </p>\r\n<p>Teemu Yllikäinen, architect and shop steward for senior salaried employees at Sanako</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Sanako Corporation</p>\r\n<p>Eurocity</p>\r\n<p>Joukahaisenkatu 1</p>\r\n<p>FI-20520 Turku</p>\r\n<p>Finland</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company website </h3>\r\n<p> <a HREF=""http://www.sanako.com/"">http://www.sanako.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Finland"~"62 - computer programming, consultancy and related activities"~"50-249"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2012-03-08"
"Sjølund, Denmark"~"Sjølund A/S"~"<p>When Danish firm&nbsp;Sj&oslash;lund established a subsidiary in China, a blacksmith was sent to China for three months to train the new staff. Furthermore, as management felt that the Chinese plant had become a bit too autonomous, it was decided to send an employee from Sjolund to China to monitor that it was running as a Sjolund clone and not just as a plant in China doing the same kind of work.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Sj&oslash;lund A/S is a specialised subcontractor in aluminium and steel section bending. &lsquo;We want to be the world&rsquo;s best to bend profiles&rsquo; is the officially declared vision, and the company currently considers itself the European leader when it comes to competence and quality. The company was founded in 1936 by a local blacksmith, and had developed into a specialised subcontractor by the second generation. Sj&oslash;lund is now highly specialised in bending profiles.</p>\r\n<p>Today the company is owned and managed by managing director S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen, who has been the sole owner of Sj&oslash;lund since he bought out his three partners in 2007. He was export manager at Sj&oslash;lund for 13 years before he took over the company completely. Apart from being a skilled worker and engineer, S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen also has a Certificate of Business Administration (CBA) from AVT Institute and has studied strategy, innovation and leadership at INSEAD (the European Institute of Business Administration).</p>\r\n<p>Sj&oslash;lund is located in the village of Sj&oslash;lund, Denmark, but in 2009 it established a production plant in Hefei, which is located between Beijing and Shanghai in China. Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending (the company name in China) is managed by a Chinese general manager, John Fang, in close cooperation with Sj&oslash;lund in Denmark. The Chinese subsidiary produces for its own customers and is not an outsourcing unit for Sj&oslash;lund in Denmark. The customers of both companies are mainly companies in the wind energy, transport and building sectors. Sj&oslash;lund owns the majority of Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending, with IFU (the Investment Fund for Developing Countries) as equity partner with 20% of ownership. IFU is a self-governing fund associated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Denmark, which invests public money in business projects in developing countries. The challenges and advantages of this management structure are described further in this case study.</p>\r\n<p>Sj&oslash;lund currently has about 65 employees and another 45 employees at Sj&oslash;lund China. Employees are mainly skilled metalworkers with many years of experience, typically organised in the Dansk Metal union. The majority of employees are men; four women work in administration. Since S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen took over the company, Sj&oslash;lund has strategically hired a few people with higher education and solid management experience at the management level, among them the CFO, the sales director and the production manager. This has raised the level of education and experience in the management team considerably. The team members are all in their forties.</p>\r\n<p>Sj&oslash;lund in Denmark is an international company, with 60%&ndash;70% of its turnover from exports. However, it still has a local presence, with 100 mainly local customers, whose orders are small. Establishing a subsidiary in China is part of an internationalisation strategy that has been generally defined by S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen and planned in detail by the management team, where Sj&oslash;lund will establish &lsquo;clones&rsquo; of Sj&oslash;lund in new growth markets especially.</p>\r\n<p>A CSR (corporate social responsibility) strategy has been developed for the new production plant in China. This was one of the conditions for funding by IFU, and it provides the staff at Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending with better working conditions than regular Chinese standards.</p>\r\n<p>Sj&oslash;lund has been profitable throughout the financial crisis, even though sales and profits fell dramatically in 2008&ndash;2009. The crisis also caused a reduction in staff from 75 to 65 in Sj&oslash;lund, Denmark &ndash; the same level as in 2005&ndash;2006. Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending in China had losses in the start-up phase, but was profitable for the first time in the first quarter of 2011, and the number of employees has increased from 15 in the start-up phase to 45 in the first quarter of 2012.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Table 1: Gross and net profits for Sj&oslash;lund, 2005&ndash;2011, in DKK (000s)</strong></p>\r\n<table summary="""" border=""1""><colgroup> <col width=""18.20%"" /> <col width=""13.40%"" /> <col width=""13.40%"" /> <col width=""13.40%"" /> <col width=""13.40%"" /> <col width=""13.40%"" /> <col width=""13.40%"" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2005&ndash;2006</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2006&ndash;2007</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2007&ndash;2008</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2008&ndash;2009</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2009&ndash;2010</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2010&ndash;2011</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Gross profit (000s)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>54,893</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>72,277</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>82,712</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>49,518</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>61,713</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>3,415</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Net profit</p>\r\n<p>(000s)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>17,077</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>27,130</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>31,594</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>9,077</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>17,887</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>-63</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><em>Source: Annual reports from Sj&oslash;lund, 2008&ndash;2011</em></p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring of Sj&oslash;lund started in 2007, when S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen bought out three co-owners in the management team. He had tested and trained his management skills while attending a CBA programme and had become ambitious for the company. Studying with managers from large and well-known companies raised his confidence in his own management abilities, and he believed that he could take Sj&oslash;lund to a higher level by establishing production in other markets. His partners and colleagues in the management team were not quite as ambitious and thought &lsquo;why bother when things are going very well anyway?&rsquo; So S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen offered to buy them out. He wrote a business plan to raise funding from the bank, mentioning the option to establish production in India or China. S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen felt that with his vision of becoming the world leader in section bending and with the global development of the industry, the company was vulnerable because of its mainly European customer base. One of the reasons was that these European customers were, or would potentially be, moving production to new markets like China or India.</p>\r\n<p>His former partners agreed to leave the company within a year of the buy-out, and this left S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen with the option of setting up a completely new management team that fitted the company vision. While the original management team were all people with a long background at Sj&oslash;lund, S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen decided to recruit a management team with a higher level of education and with management experience from other companies. The impact of this strategy was illustrated in the interview with the CFO at Sj&oslash;lund, who has experience of business development from working in different large corporations. At the job interview, he told S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen that if he wanted to hire him, it should be because he wanted to develop and grow his company. &lsquo;Business development is the fun part of the job&rsquo;, as he said.</p>\r\n<p>In 2008 the new management team decided to start working on establishing a production plant in China to be able to serve customers there. That China was chosen, and not India, was due to the fact that Sj&oslash;lund was already delivering to a customer operating in China. Therefore the management team expected that they would have a customer base to start on.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process described in this case study is mainly the process of establishing a production plant in China as a subsidiary of Sj&oslash;lund. However, the decision to expand to China was to a large extent a consequence of a restructuring in ownership and management. Therefore these events are also integrated in the case study.</p>\r\n<p>When the decision was made, a specific business plan for the production plant in China was made. The new CFO, Finn Mortensen, had previous experience in establishing new business units, from working in large international corporations.</p>\r\n<p>The process of establishing production in China started with hiring a Chinese engineer with a Danish MBA, who at that time worked for the big Danish corporation Danfoss. After some scepticism over why an educated man in a big corporation wanted to work for a small company like Sj&oslash;lund, the company hired John Fang in September 2008. He started out by working for three months at Sj&oslash;lund in Denmark to learn more about the company and to &lsquo;breathe the air&rsquo; of the Sj&oslash;lund culture. The company began creating scorecards for the different factors they should look for when they decided where to establish the company.</p>\r\n<h3>Greenfield phase</h3>\r\n<p>In the early greenfield phase, the only resources were John Fang and a lot of extra work for the management team. The CFO visited seven different sites in China and had a lot of meetings with IFU (before John Fang was employed), while S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen focused on contacting potential customers.</p>\r\n<p>Sj&oslash;lund contacted private Danish business networks in the industrial centres on the east coast of China and got a lot of advice from people there and looked at potential facilities. However, the company finally chose a project in a smaller industrial area in Hefei, west of Shanghai. This meant that it got a lot more attention for a small project from the local authorities than it would have got in the larger industrial cities along the coast.</p>\r\n<h3>Technical set-up</h3>\r\n<p>After finding the right place and getting formalities in order, the next step for Sj&oslash;lund was the technical setup. In this phase, one of the most important tasks was investing the capital from Sj&oslash;lund and IFU in machines and training the new staff of 15 people. In a company where 80% of the work is craft and 20% is standardised industrial processes, there is a lot of tacit knowledge to be transferred. Therefore a blacksmith was sent to China for three months to train the new staff.</p>\r\n<p>However, getting customers wasn&rsquo;t as easy as expected. Sj&oslash;lund&rsquo;s expected customers in China didn&rsquo;t place any orders, but a European train manufacturer that knew Sj&oslash;lund from the European market placed a big order. This customer had been the only one notified regarding the establishment of the production plant in China. Its order all of a sudden provided plenty of work, more than the Chinese plant was able to deliver in terms of the quality Sj&oslash;lund wants to be known for. This meant that the Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending had to involve the Danish mother company in executing the order from China. It led to extra work and capacity challenges in Denmark on the operational level as well as for management. The project lasted a full year.</p>\r\n<p>However, the big order and the fact that training takes time also forced Sj&oslash;lund to be innovative and rethink the Chinese strategy. Since the company couldn&rsquo;t train people fast enough, it involved one of its experienced blacksmiths in transferring all of his tacit knowledge about a specific process into a machine that could automate the job.</p>\r\n<p>After this experience, S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen has been rethinking and has learned that maybe the production in the Chinese plant should not be based on 80% craftsmanship and 20% production but maybe rather 50/50 or even 20/80, since it is a long process to train and develop good craftsmen.</p>\r\n<p>During the process, Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending was managed mainly by general manager John Fang in frequent dialogue with the management in Denmark. However, S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen felt that the Chinese plant was becoming too autonomous. In the summer of 2011, he decided that he wanted an employee from Sj&oslash;lund in Denmark posted to China at a high level, to monitor that it was running as a Sj&oslash;lund clone and not just as a plant in China doing the same kind of work. The devil is in the detail, and becoming a Sj&oslash;lund clone takes more than some months of training in the start-up phase. As S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen says: &lsquo;There is no easy way to learn how we do things at Sj&oslash;lund. Here we breathe it in the air.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>He subsequently hired a supply chain controller who had just finished his masters degree, but had been working at Sj&oslash;lund during his studies and knew the company very well. His job in China is to monitor the quality, key performance indicators and human resources and send reports to Sj&oslash;lund in Denmark. The job is not planned as a permanent job for him.</p>\r\n<p>S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen has started considering posting a Danish production manager in China to strengthen the production management, but he is not yet quite sure how to do it so that the Chinese management doesn&rsquo;t lose face.</p>\r\n<h3>Staff involvement</h3>\r\n<p>Staff at Sj&oslash;lund were not involved in the process of planning the China project, except for the management team. They were informed of it at a company meeting before John Fang started working in the company in September 2008.</p>\r\n<p>There were some sceptics in the beginning, who were concerned that production would be moved to China, even though the major purpose was to strengthen the company and bring in new customers. Therefore it was helpful to morale to see that nobody was laid off and that it actually created jobs in Denmark too.</p>\r\n<p>During the process, there was some scepticism when the project in China was still losing money, but as it started getting customers and as employees actually saw that Sj&oslash;lund could also operate in China, they developed a sense of pride as well.</p>\r\n<p>At the management level, Sj&oslash;lund offered shares in the China plant to the management team at the beginning to motivate them. The production manager was not interested and wasn&rsquo;t really that keen on the Chinese project and the travelling it implied. According to S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen, the lack of commitment from a key person in Denmark delayed the project by about a year. The production manager chose to leave Sj&oslash;lund during the process, which enabled the company to hire a new production manager who knew what the job would involve from the beginning.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>According to S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen, the most significant challenges and constraints in the early process were getting customers, keeping the staff and making them believe that things would work out in the end and that customers would come. As for any start-up, it was also important to keep the costs low.</p>\r\n<p>Hiring Chinese workers was difficult in the early stages when there was no operating production plant to show, so they had to imagine the place where they would be working.</p>\r\n<p>S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen also learned that particularly in the early stages, it is important to have a native Chinese person involved in the process who understands how bureaucracies and relationships work in China.</p>\r\n<p>Another lesson learned was that it is difficult to transfer work that is based on good craftsmanship to China. S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen subscribes to the belief that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to master a craft. There is no easy way around that, and it doesn&rsquo;t work if people try to come up with their own solutions when they lack the basic skills.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the company&rsquo;s culture of quality, order and cleanliness can be difficult to adopt for Chinese employees. S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen understood why when he was taken to the places where workers live their daily lives to see the physical environment that was part of their reality.</p>\r\n<p>One thing that was easy to integrate, however, was the team-building activities that are also a part of the culture at Sj&oslash;lund. This seems to fit well with the Chinese culture.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding sales, Sj&oslash;lund also realised that it is very difficult to win orders before you have a production plant to show to your customers.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Sj&oslash;lund has received loans and equity capital from IFU, and it is a partner in Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending in China. S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen considers IFU a very valuable partner that, apart from funding, can offer advice on Chinese regulations and access to local networks. The presence of a Chinese person from IFU on the board is also very helpful when Danes and Chinese try to sort out issues caused by different cultures and different views on management.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from IFU, Sj&oslash;lund has not taken advantage of any public support programmes, but it has experienced a very helpful attitude from other Danish companies in China, and Nordic Industrial Park has been very helpful in finding a good location.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>In general, Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending is running according to plan &ndash; just delayed by about a year. This means that an enduring positive impact on earnings is yet to be seen.</p>\r\n<p>During the process, the profitability of the company suffered since it had to produce some units for the first orders in Denmark and sell them below cost price, since the cost price of producing in Denmark is higher. Furthermore, the process created a lot of turbulence at Sj&oslash;lund in Denmark since it had to solve problems that the Chinese plant couldn&rsquo;t solve. It even had to compromise on quality for new customers, which everyone at Sj&oslash;lund disliked having to do. Existing customers haven&rsquo;t suffered on quality, but have had to accept longer terms of delivery. And in this turbulent period, the production manager had to split his time more or less equally between Denmark and China. This has been very costly, S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen points out.</p>\r\n<p>S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen&rsquo;s conclusion is that it is possible to make a clone of Sj&oslash;lund in another country &ndash; even though he may have been sceptical about whether it was actually possible. This has given him the courage to do it again in other BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) or the USA. However, it is necessary that Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending is up and running before management resources can be allocated to new projects. He expects nevertheless that his ambitious management teams will be ready for new challenges when the most important Chinese problems are solved.</p>\r\n<p>On the employment side, Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending has created 45 jobs in China , as well as four or five jobs in production and one or two administrative jobs at Sj&oslash;lund Denmark.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from that, it has required different meeting schedules due to the time difference and obviously more travel activity. The management team especially has a considerably increased workload, since they have had to split their time more or less equally between Denmark and China.</p>\r\n<p>The heavy workload also had some positive consequences. The CFO had to delegate as much as possible down the organisation, and that was a gift to the bookkeeper, who had asked for new challenges. However, the CFO points out that you have to have the right staff to do that and to be careful to delegate the right jobs to the right people.</p>\r\n<p>Salaries in general haven&rsquo;t been affected by the restructuring, but as S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen points out, the staff has got first-hand experience of the competition from China &ndash; and some are probably happier with what they&rsquo;ve got when it comes to wages and working conditions.</p>\r\n<p>Travel and cooperation with the Chinese subsidiary also involves middle managers, and that has raised standards for new middle managers. In future, Sj&oslash;lund will require English skills from all middle managers.</p>\r\n<p>As indicated earlier, operating in China hasn&rsquo;t just required new skills. It has also added new skills to the company, such as new ways to control and monitor quality and performance, which may be useful for similar projects in the future. Structure and documentation have become keywords in the organisational strategy. As the CFO explains, Sj&oslash;lund has done something for the first time without the know-how to do it. Next time it will know better.</p>\r\n<p>Sj&oslash;lund Profile Bending in China wasn&rsquo;t expected to be profitable in the first two to three years. Because improving sales took longer than expected, and because indirect costs were higher than expected, it wasn&rsquo;t until the first quarter of 2011 that the Chinese subsidiary was profitable for the first time. Furthermore, the lack of focus on China in-house at Sj&oslash;lund has harmed the performance of the Chinese plant, according to S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen, since they didn&rsquo;t spend enough time following up. He expects overall profitability in 2012.</p>\r\n<p>On a personal level, the Chinese plant has given S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen a lot of extra work, but also an opportunity to closely compare his original factory to something similar. It has also given him a good networking icebreaker to have production in China, and it gives Sj&oslash;lund and S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen a different status among other business leaders in his network.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>In Sj&oslash;lund, S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen has experienced both advantages and disadvantages in being an SME trying to establish a production plant in China.</p>\r\n<p>First, he mentions the speed of decision-making and taking action in an SME as an advantage. During his CBA studies, he was stunned how little top managers in large corporations knew about what was going on at the lower levels of their organisations. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m an &ldquo;undercover boss&rdquo; every day&rsquo;, he said, with reference to the Undercover Boss television franchise. &lsquo;I constantly know where they are and whether they are with me or not.&rsquo; He also points out that a certain degree of sympathy for the owner can make hard decisions easier to accept. The authority of an owner-manager also makes it possible to say and do things that would never be accepted from an employed CEO. And having built the company gives an owner-manager an instinct for how people feel and what can be done.</p>\r\n<p>The close relations between owner-manager and staff are underlined by the absence of an elected employee representative at Sj&oslash;lund and very limited union involvement in employee affairs.</p>\r\n<p>Being a well-educated manager in a very non-academic world, he points out the importance of having a hands-on approach to restructuring. But he has also learned the importance of having academics around you to keep the management team dynamic. The management team S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen originally bought out was more homogeneous, maybe too homogeneous.</p>\r\n<p>One reason why a management team in an SME may become very homogenous was offered by the CFO at Sj&oslash;lund. With experience from large corporations, he has noticed how people in large corporations tend to be more focused on their actual profession, whereas a CFO at Sj&oslash;lund will also get technical questions about profile bending. In an SME, the managers have to understand the company as a whole.</p>\r\n<p>The disadvantages for SMEs in a restructuring process are mainly the limited financial and management resources and the dependency on a few key employees. In the Sj&oslash;lund case, it was a further challenge that the production and sales managers have been replaced twice since 2007. The dependency on a few key employees means that there is no backup, so these employees simply have to work longer hours when they start a restructuring project.</p>\r\n<p>S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen is sure that it is better to be a big company if you want to start up production in China, but the project has given Sj&oslash;lund the confidence to start new plants in other BRIC countries. For the next project, he has learned that the process will have to be managed more tightly from the parent company through reports and through close communication between functions in different countries (matrix organisation).</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, he wants a key person from the parent organisation to be on the spot to observe and report, somebody who has breathed the culture of the organisation and is able to see the small deviations from the overall culture and philosophy.</p>\r\n<p>And finally he points out that next time he will appoint the best man for the job, not just the person it is most convenient to allocate to at the time.</p>\r\n<p>Concerning advice to policymakers, S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen points out that access to funding can make a big difference. However, he says that the Danish guarantee schemes from V&aelig;kstfonden are ineffective because banks do not want to take their share of the risk. (V&aelig;kstfonden is a state investment fund that aims to create new growth companies by providing venture capital and competence. It invests equity and provides loans and guarantees in collaboration with private partners and Danish financial institutions.) In relation to China specifically, he mentions that the help of mayors can make a difference.</p>\r\n<p>S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen&rsquo;s best advice to colleagues is to make sure they have the necessary financial and management resources and do not underestimate the resources needed &ndash; and to appoint the best man for the job.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Jan Bendtsen, Syddansk Universitet, Kolding, Denmark.</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen, owner and managing director at Sj&oslash;lund A/S</p>\r\n<p>Finn Mortensen, CFO at Sj&oslash;lund A/S</p>\r\n<h3>Contact information</h3>\r\n<p>Skamlingvejen 146</p>\r\n<p>DK-6093 Sj&oslash;lund</p>\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.sjoelund.dk/"">http://www.sjoelund.dk/</a></p>\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3>\r\n<p>Annual reports from 2008, 2009 and 2010</p>\r\n<p>Business plan from 2007, when S&oslash;ren Ravn Jensen bought Sj&oslash;lund</p>"~"Denmark"~"25 - manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"globalisation"~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2012-01-26"
"Software company, the Netherlands"~"Software company"~"<p>This Dutch company provides software services and products for both private and public sector organisations. The restructuring was triggered by a drop in turnover in 2008 which created acute financial problems. When it proved impossible to obtain bank finding, the owners were forced to put their own money into the company. This helped them to survive through tough times and when turnover figures started to increase they were able to get bank credit again.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile </h2>\r\n<p>Founded in 2003, the company provides software services and products to deliver, process, analyse, and manage geospatial information. The company is a reseller of a software package and delivers related training and support. </p>\r\n<p>The company provides its services in the Benelux countries. About 80% of turnover is generated in the Netherlands and 20% in Belgium with a very small percentage generated in Luxembourg. The company provides services to both private and public sector organisations. Public customers are very diverse, including the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment. </p>\r\n<p>The company is formally part of a holding company (Company C) whose activities can be divided into two business lines: software (Company A) and data (Company B). Companies A and B operate independently. Company A has six employees and Company B has two employees. The holding company has three owners (stockholders). Two stockholders (and founders) are also directors of one of Companies A and B. Because of the size of the workforce there is no works council.  </p>\r\n<p>In 2011, company A moved from Reeuwijk to Capelle a/d IJssel. The main reason for this was to be in easier reach for customers. The new location is close to a highway and a more urban area, with more (potential) customers in the immediate vicinity. </p>\r\n<p>An interview was held with one of the three stockholders, the director of Company A. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The formation of a holding company with two companies under it is the result of the restructuring. Before this, there was only one company (Company D). At start-up Company D had six owners (stockholders), five of whom worked in the company, and comprised three business lines:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>data</li>\r\n<li>software</li>\r\n<li>projects</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Company D achieved constant turnover and employment growth in 2003 to 2008. They started with three employees in 2003 and by early 2009 were employing 14. Most of the employees are highly educated in the field of geographical science or mathematics.</p>\r\n<p>The main problem Company D had to face in early 2009 was that turnover declined in the last two quarters of 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter of 2008 was especially troubling, since this period was normally the best in terms of turnover. This decline was mainly the effect of the (economic) crisis on the sector and it mainly affected the projects department of Company D.</p>\r\n<p>Because of this decline, and the fact that the six stockholders did not agree about (re)financing (for example, getting additional private funds), the company had to file for bankruptcy in 2009. Three of the stockholders made a restart with the company, with only two business lines intact (data and software) as separate companies (A and B) with a central holding company (C). The projects business line was not deemed profitable enough for a restart. The owners did not see enough growth potential in the projects business line which was the weakest link in the three business lines.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes </h2>\r\n<p>The company took several actions before Company D went bankrupt at the end of 2009. </p>\r\n<p>First, the company decided to make use of the part-time unemployment benefit scheme. This scheme, documented by <a HREF=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2010/639/en/2/EF10639EN.pdf"">a 2010 Eurofound report (119kb PDF</a>) was launched by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment to cope with the crisis, making it possible for employers to retain skilled workers in difficult economic times. Under the scheme, employers could reduce employees’ work hours (laid down in the working contract) by up to 50%, with employees receiving unemployment benefits for non-working hours. Use of the scheme has to be approved by the ‘UWV Werkbedrijf’ (administrative office for the Employee Insurance Agency). The company used this measure for three employees during the last quarter of 2008 for a period of six to nine months. The employees that were selected (by the management) for this measure were the ones who had the lowest workload, and were informed in one-to-one talks with the management. </p>\r\n<p>During 2009, it became clear that the company needed increased financial means to survive. The bank would not give them an additional loan, and finding another (private) investor was not an option for all stockholders. This meant they had to refinance Company D on their own, by investing additional (private) funds. The six stockholders were unable to agree on a common solution: half wanted to refinance and half did not. Due to this division, the only possibility was to start a bankruptcy procedure and in November 2009 the company filed for bankruptcy. </p>\r\n<p>During 2009, two employees left the company at their own initiative. Both worked in the projects department, and recognised that their workload was declining. Their employer helped them search for new work via managers’ networks. The management assisted them because they felt responsible for their employees, and because formal dismissals would cost a lot more time and money. </p>\r\n<p>In addition, the workforce was downsized further by: </p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>not extending the contract of a temporary\r\nemployee;</li>\r\n<li>offering two employees a settlement.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The settlement meant contracts were voluntarily dissolved in return for financial compensation. These two employees had the least amount of work within the company at the time. They received a compensation which the company could just about financially bear, in light of their financial problems.</p>\r\n<p>One administrative employee was not given a job with the new organisation after the bankruptcy, because this position was no longer necessary.</p>\r\n<p>There was no formal plan setting out these activities.  </p>\r\n<p>One stockholder wanted financial compensation for leaving the company. It was not possible to come to an agreement and the case was settled in court, with no financial compensation to be paid. </p>\r\n<p>The company filed for bankruptcy in November 2009, and a trustee was appointed by the court. Early in the bankruptcy process (still in 2009) the interviewed stockholder took the decision to restart, together with two other stockholders. The interviewed stockholder was asked by the trustee if he wanted to make a restart. He decided that he would like to continue with company activities (he still had a passion for his work and company) and asked two other stockholders to join him, and they agreed.</p>\r\n<p>In order to restart, the (potential) new owners had to write a business plan for the trustee describing the plan to organise the restart (financial and organisational). Most work for the plan was done during November 2009. They eventually got the green light from the trustee to restart. But the total process took a long time, finishing in January 2012. In this process they decided that working with a holding company (Company C) and two separate companies for the data and software business lines (A and B) was the best option. By having only one person responsible for one business line there was more clarity of responsibility (instead of six stockholders who all had a say in the entire company). They decided to drop the projects business line because it was the least profitable. The three stockholders also had to invest additional private money in the company, because they were unable to get additional funding from a bank. During the restart process, a lot of time and energy went in setting up the new structure, deciding the size of the workforce, coupled with the additional administrative burden regarding the bankruptcy and restart. </p>\r\n<p>At the start of the bankruptcy process, a potential buyer came forward, and one of the other stockholders (besides the three that joined together, as mentioned above) also made an attempt to take over the company. The trustee eventually chose the restart plan of the interviewed stockholder. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>An important challenge was how, and what, to tell employees about the problems experienced during 2009. What information do you want to tell the employees, and what information do you want to hold back? Because it is a small company, it was no secret that times were difficult. The interviewed stockholder updated the situation for employees every Monday morning. </p>\r\n<p>It was very difficult for the six stockholders to achieve a consensus, even with the help of a mediator. This process took a lot of time and energy away from trying to save the company in a decisive manner. </p>\r\n<p>In the spring of 2009 (before the bankruptcy process) it was possible to obtain additional bank funds and the company was able to postpone payment (including a payment arrangement) to the Dutch Tax Office (<i>Belastingdienst</i>). This helped the company to survive a little longer. But most loans were too large for the company to repay on their own, encouraging the stockholders to refinance the company later in 2009. This meant that they had to put additional (private) funds in the company. Because this failed, the company had to file for bankruptcy. A big challenge for the restart was to acquire additional bank funding. Because there were fewer potential financiers (stockholders), additional bank funding was preferred. But the bank refused, feeling it too risky to invest in a bankrupt/restarting company. However, the three owners/stockholders felt the company would be able to exploit the growing market, even with the reduced work force, and keep on working without bank credit. By working on a monthly basis, they were able to keep the company running with their own limited financial resources. When the company was able to show increasing turnover figures, they were able to obtain bank credit. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support </h2>\r\n<p>During the restructuring process and bankruptcy, several parties played a role. These were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the <i>UWV Werkbedrijf</i>;</li>\r\n<li>a commissioner of the supervisory board (of Company\r\nD);</li>\r\n<li>the accountant of the company;</li>\r\n<li>a private legal office specialised in human\r\nresources;</li>\r\n<li>a private mediator;</li>\r\n<li>a trustee.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The <i>UWV Werkbedrijf</i> (administrative office for the Employee Insurance Agency) is responsible for the part-time unemployment benefit scheme. It took the company more paperwork than expected to get the employees in such a scheme. But the office was very quick in responding to questions the company had about the application and duration of the benefit. </p>\r\n<p>The commissioner of the supervisory board helped the interviewed stockholder by giving him advice and support. The accountant advised on the financial aspects. Both helped the interviewed stockholder to get a better handle on the situation during 2009. Furthermore, a private legal office specialising in human resources was hired to handle personnel issues during 2009. </p>\r\n<p>Stockholder disagreement regarding refinancing led to a mediator being hired at the beginning of 2009, to facilitate discussions. Stockholders hoped that the mediator would help them come to an agreement. However, this was not the case, and the bankruptcy went ahead at the end of 2009. </p>\r\n<p>When a company files for bankruptcy, a trustee is appointed by the court to manage the assets of an individual or a corporate entity. The trustee is responsible for the interest of the creditors of the bankrupt's estate, for liquidating the estate and for making payment arrangements with creditors. In the first weeks of the bankruptcy process, the trustee suggested that the interviewed stockholder might restart the company, and helped him in the bankruptcy and restart process, by giving practical advice and helping with the necessary paperwork. </p>\r\n<p>The interviewed stockholder is generally happy with the help received from the private advisors mentioned above. He sees no need for public advisors, even though they might charge less than private advisors. He said: </p>\r\n<BLOCK-QUOTE><p>\r\n<i>When you need help, especially in challenging times, you\r\nwant a good advisor and that will cost the company some money. \r\n</i> </p></BLOCK-QUOTE><p>However, the interviewed stockholder underestimated the administrative burden of a bankruptcy followed by a new start-up and was very satisfied with all of the support he got, with one exception: the duration of the bankruptcy process. This started in November 2009 and ended in January 2012. The interviewed stockholder felt the trustee took longer than was needed, in his opinion to declare more time (and get more money) for the process. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring </h2>\r\n<p>The outcomes of the restructuring event (reorganisation/bankruptcy) were that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the business line ‘projects’ was\r\ndropped;</li>\r\n<li>the total number of employees decreased from 14 to\r\n8;</li>\r\n<li>there are now three stockholders instead of\r\nsix;</li>\r\n<li>Company D was transferred to a holding company (C)\r\ncovering two separate companies (A and B).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Most employees made redundant found new work quickly. Employees were very cooperative in accepting a settlement. Only one stockholder wanted financial compensation, which ultimately led to a legal process. </p>\r\n<p>Current forecasts (spring 2012) for the company are good. After a turbulent year in 2009, the market is stable at the moment, and some slight growth is expected. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The interviewed stockholder says that, looking back, little attention has been paid to employees. Those still working for the company are glad they are working, but the process was undoubtedly chaotic for them. The problems in the organisation meant that the owners have a lot to deal with, and human resource management is not as high on the priority list as it could be. Creditors are their most pressing problem, and the threat of bailiffs is a more acute problem than possibly dissatisfied employees. It is also hard to keep looking at the ‘bigger picture’ during difficult times.</p>\r\n<p>This problem is also because small company owners perform many different roles, being responsible for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>human resources management;</li>\r\n<li>ensuring an adequate workload for the\r\nemployees;</li>\r\n<li>the financial position of the company.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are no different specialised departments as there are in larger companies. </p>\r\n<p>Another important lesson learnt was that it is very difficult to manage a company with six shareholders, especially when they disagree during difficult times. </p>\r\n<p>The interviewed stockholder has also learned a lot on a personal level during the process of reorganisation and bankruptcy.  </p>\r\n<BLOCK-QUOTE><p>\r\n<i>We are used to prosperity and there was always work to\r\ndo. But when times get tough you notice that you have taken a lot of these\r\nthings for granted. You also realise that the concept of being an employer is\r\noften seen as an abstract thing. Employees look to the owner for their job, they\r\ndepend on you. But as an owner you know that it is your money that is really\r\ninvested in the company, and it is at risk if the company is unprofitable.\r\nEmployees don’t see it that way.\r\n</i> </p></BLOCK-QUOTE><p>Another important thing to mention is that ‘as a part owner of a company you use your own network to find people that can help you’. The interviewed stockholder found the mediator that helped in the talks between the six stockholders this way. He is a member of a soccer club, and via one of his teammates he found the mediator. </p>\r\n<p>The interviewed stockholder is also disappointed by the level of bank commitment to finance entrepreneurs. Banks are looking only for safety and follow internal regulations, which is understandable but which can stifle entrepreneurship with its associated risk. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Michel Winnubst, EIM </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interview</b></p>\r\n<p>One stockholder/owner</p>\r\n<p><b>Secondary sources</b></p>\r\n<p>Information from the website of the company </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Netherlands"~"62 - computer programming, consultancy and related activities"~"10-49"~"0-9"~NULL~"(avoiding) bankruptcy*internal restructuring"~"2012-03-12"
"TAD, Latvia"~"TAD Ltd."~"<p>TAD was formed when entrepreneurs unrelated to the business bought out DUNI, a bankrupt provider of disposable dishes and household items that operated three shops and a wholesale base in Latvia in 2010. Most employees (23 out of 28) were let go and replaced by more qualified staff. The new staff had to work overtime and nights and help to win new business to save the company. Cash flow problems meant salaries were not paid every month and staff were offered shares in the company instead. The company was turned around and in early 2012 had 22 staff. </p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>TAD was established in November 2010, after purchasing the company DUNI (established in 1996) following the bankruptcy of DUNI in 2010. TAD’s main focus is on the distribution of disposable dishes and household items. In spring 2012, TAD had three shops and one wholesale base, all located in Riga, the capital of Latvia. TAD is mainly focused on a business-to-business approach, targeting relatively large, mainly local firms. It is an independent SME, owned by a group of people, some of them having other businesses, and managed by the CEO. TAD’s chief aim is to be a major supplier of disposable dishes and household items for these companies, which, according to the company owners, can only be achieved by a creative approach in sales. Good networking and logistics with direct manufacturers that ensures best price, quality and timely supplies of products is another prerequisite for the success of TAD. </p>\r\n<p>Out of 22 employees working for TAD in spring 2012, nine deal with monitoring and quality assurance. According to the company owners, monitoring supplies is crucial for TAD, since most of the products the company sells in Latvia come from abroad, mostly Poland and Estonia. Overstocking, failure to deliver on time, and orders not meeting customer requirements (and changing requirements) are all factors that can harm TAD’s business. In view of this, TAD implements monitoring activities every other month, thus minimising losses.  </p>\r\n<p>The company has no works council or trade union presence. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Following its establishment in 1996, DUNI achieved reasonable profits. The successful internal structure of the company and well-organised control of cash flow played a significant role in this regard. Yet, the situation changed drastically in 2006 with a change of the board members. The strategy of the new board was focused on saving money whenever possible, not excluding salaries. This in turn changed the employee structure of the company: less-experienced employees willing to work for lower salaries were hired. According to the owners of the firm, the major problem with this move was that higher skills were required from relatively low-skilled people. For instance, low-paid staff got involved in projects of highest importance that required fundamental skills and knowledge. As a consequence, it was not uncommon for decisions that had a direct influence on the company’s performance indicators to be made without proper evaluation. </p>\r\n<p>Still, perhaps in part due to the rapidly growing economies of Latvia and other Baltic countries during 2006–2007, the company managed to be profitable while ignoring the basics of doing effective business. This, however, changed with the economic downturn in 2008, and the company started losing money very fast. In 2010 the inevitable happened: DUNI declared its bankruptcy. To summarise, the poor quality of management from the board, poor strategies that led to hiring low-skilled employees, in combination with the economic downturn, led to bankruptcy.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Four months after the initial filing for bankruptcy, DUNI was bought out by a team of entrepreneurs not previously linked with the firm, and renamed TAD. The delay of four months is a legal restriction. After it has filed for bankruptcy, a company can be bought out only after four months, and every legal action in which the company is engaged is transferred to the new company. This implies fulfilling the firm’s obligations to employees, suppliers and customers. In this case, the restructuring process was initiated by the bankruptcy. Success of acquisition, however, usually depends on the quality of decisions, the competence of the people involved and their speed of action. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was semi-formal, that is, based on a short action plan prepared by the new owners that allowed for various ad hoc activities where necessary. As the owners put it, restructuring as a process lasted some six months and had to be quite radical, as almost everything, starting from equipment and ending with employees, had to be changed. This is how the new owners tried to answer the question ‘What now?’,  a common question that follows acquisition of bankrupt companies. To be more specific, TAD started restructuring with the factor that is most important almost for any business, namely, its employees. </p>\r\n<p>First, all employees were informed about the forthcoming restructuring process using informal communication methods. Then, the new management team assessed all employees, and as predicted, the quality was far from good. The owners considered various strategies to overcome this challenge. One option was to train existing staff, but this was counter to the main goal of the new owners, which was to start to earn profits as soon as possible without investing considerable amounts of money. The process of training existing employees, even though it could potentially bring positive results, promised to be a long and expensive process. In addition, the previous experience of the new owners suggested that spending time and money on employees that did not manage to do their work properly for years is often waste of time and money.</p>\r\n<p>The company did not have free financial resources and also had time pressure, so the new owners took quite drastic action: most employees (23 out of 28) were let go and replaced by more qualified staff. With this approach, the company faced yet another problem: the temporary cut in its operation while former staff were replaced with new employees. Overall, searching for new employees took two months, and during this process the company suffered some losses. The length of time to replace people, however, can be justified, as the board decided to hire only experts with good references and more than ten years’ experience. TAD did not choose an open competition where anyone could apply. It was a ‘closed door’ process, where only people known by the board were invited to apply, and jobs were offered to the best. </p>\r\n<p>After the replacement of most employees, in mid-2011, three more employees were hired to take over the import and horeca departments. (Horeca refers to a sector of the food industry that services food and beverages; the word is an abbreviation of hotels, restaurants and catering.) This was when ‘real’ restructuring processes, with new people on board, could start. Every employee was involved in the restructuring process by collecting and analysing necessary market information, presenting suggestions to the board and deciding upon the best strategies to make TAD a more competitive company.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p> It is often said that ‘you don’t need to reinvent the wheel’, and according to owners of TAD, this thinking can be applied upon purchasing a company. Despite having to deal with a lot of paperwork and countless meetings with lawyers and court visits, TAD already had some foundation, the ‘leftovers’ from DUNI. These included a number of suppliers and customers; thus in case of TAD, it was indeed restructuring, rather than a new start-up when these would be acquired newly. What had to be generated anew, however, were attitudes and image. TAD had to convince both previous customers and also suppliers that it ‘meant business’, and the only way to do that was showing customers that both products and services provided by TAD were of the highest level. </p>\r\n<p>The company also had to deal with many legal issues, and the associated paperwork was onerous. To understand the context, it should be mentioned that, for instance, the staff that were laid off were very disappointed and often argued that there had been no reason for them to be let go. In some cases, ex-employees demanded compensation from TAD, yet TAD managed to avoid paying extra money without good reason. There were also no court cases for any of the disputes. </p>\r\n<p>Apart from solving human-resources-related issues, restructuring processes usually also involve answering several questions with regard to financial resources. Luckily, the new owners of TAD had enough money to complete the restructuring. Without doubt, this played a role, as the company was not dependent on any other stakeholders, as in cases when restructuring is funded by a third party. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>TAD’s owners undertook restructuring without much external advice or support. Only in some circumstances were experts invited, especially during the phase when most of the decision-makers that did not work efficiently had been let go and replacement staff were yet to come. External experts were hired on a short-term contract basis. Experts included accountants that dealt with financial issues, and lawyers that ensured the smooth transition from the bankruptcy of DUNI to the creation of TAD. Attracting experts was not cheap, yet with the right people on board, such investment paid off.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Soon after the internal restructuring, the atmosphere in the company improved substantially, and TAD began to generate its first noticeable profit. Yet, the sacrifices that were made to achieve this were staggering. Out of 28 staff, 23 were laid off in order to keep the system up and running. That makes it approximately 82% of people that were let go. Those that were newly hired had to work overtime, sometimes even at night, to implement the restructuring process, including winning new clients. </p>\r\n<p>The investments that were necessary to replace employees had some influence on the cash flow. As a result of restructuring expenses, TAD’s financial resources were rather limited. In some cases, it meant that employees were working a month or two without a regular salary; they were paid as soon as some income was generated, but it didn’t happen on a regular basis due to adjustments made on the fly. Not all companies would be able to handle that kind of pressure, and most employees would simply march out of the company without looking back, demanding financial compensation. The employees that were hired, however, were well informed about the possibility of such a situation and accepted it for the sake of ‘achieving good times together’. Yet, they needed some guarantees that salaries would be paid whatever the future looked like. The situation was handled by offering employees company shares.</p>\r\n<p>Months later, TAD started to generate its first profit. People were getting salaries on a regular basis and TAD started to flourish. New employees were hired, reaching 19 full-time employees. This was the point when the idea of expanding the market became interesting, and TAD’s particular interest was in the horeca concept. </p>\r\n<p>TAD, as many other companies, faced the challenge of meeting its target client base requirement to find the cheapest possible products, combined with good to exceptional quality. Meeting the needs of these customers, however, proved to be difficult since existing suppliers were setting prices too high, rendering the generation of profit next to impossible. Thus, in many cases, new suppliers had to be sought, and were found in Poland. As a consequence, TAD managed to decrease cost per employee by almost 40%, increasing the competitiveness of the company. Contracts with previous suppliers were cancelled.</p>\r\n<p>The horeca department soon expanded from non-existence to being one of the biggest departments in the company, and one that brings a major income share. Furthermore, tackling the concept of horeca (that is, introducing the new service of food and beverages) decreased expenses by almost 30%, implying that goods could be offered at lower prices without greatly affecting the profit. Since the factory in Poland produces only for TAD, the relationship is a monopsony, where a company produces only for one company in great amounts but for a lower price.</p>\r\n<p>Having a wholesale base, international suppliers and a new target market meant that more effort should be allocated to marketing the company. The obvious thing to do was to set up a website. That, apart from serving a marketing function, also helped to monitor stock levels. Yet, it was not enough to attract any significant customers. It was simply not paying off in the beginning. An interesting method was applied to increase the levels of supply and to achieve more contracts. TAD representatives started calling companies that would be able to spend much more than smaller firms, trying to create partnerships. This method of marketing worked surprisingly well, generating a good share of income. </p>\r\n<p>The next big step was to engage in active competition with market leaders such as leading retail chains in Latvia, RIMI and Maxima. Such companies have their suppliers and factories and usually avoid signing deals with small companies like TAD, and this, in fact, happened. As a consequence, TAD faced the risk that both giants would easily out-price it in the market. TAD decided to diversify location-wise, by opening three shops in Riga. </p>\r\n<p>Because RIMI has focused on disposable dishes much more than Maxima, RIMI is TAD’s main competitor. It didn’t seem worthwhile to RIMI, so it ignored the competition from TAD. Soon after, there was a noticeable drop in demand levels of disposable dishes from RIMI and the company started to lose it profits. Then a ‘competition dance’ began.</p>\r\n<p>In microeconomic terms, such situation is called a Stackelberg competition, where the market leaders set their price and the smaller company (defined as a follower) adjusts its price accordingly. The fact that TAD could offer goods in bulk gave the company the edge, and RIMI kept losing money. Thus, the only reasonable way out for RIMI was to sign a partnership deal with TAD. TAD, however, was not interested in such a deal, as the company managed to grow outside these retail chains, and the offer was declined. This, in turn resulted in something that was even hard to imagine at the beginning: RIMI simply had to react to a newcomer into market, TAD, by adjusting its product range in given categories according to the decreased demand. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>As common sense suggests, dealing with restructuring in small companies is much easier than in large corporations. It takes less financial investment and also less time to implement changes. There are also fewer employees to deal with, and it is easier to keep everything organised in the way owner or managers want to see it.</p>\r\n<p>According to the experience of TAD, timing is the most important factor to determine the success of the restructuring. Taking immediate actions to maintain a positive economic profit is not an easy process. Assembling a strong team in a short period of time was difficult for TAD. It was even more challenging to ensure that the newly hired team started working efficiently from the very beginning. There was simply no time for a slow start: results had to be achieved immediately. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Arnis Sauka, with assistance from Ringolds Leščinskis and Hanna Efremenko, Stockholm School of Economics in Riga</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>Interviews with CEO and employees of TAD</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.tadlv.lv/"">www.tadlv.lv</a> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Latvia"~"46 - wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"(avoiding) bankruptcy*internal restructuring"~"2011-12-05"
"The Whole Company, Denmark"~"The Whole Company"~"<p>In Denmark The Whole Company arose from a group of trade companies in the food sector, selling snacks, dried fruit products, tea, herbs, vinegar and nutritional supplements. For over a decade the original company grew by acquisition and continued to keep the brands of the acquired companies. In the face of the 2008 financial crisis the owner had to look hard at the strategic direction of the business. With all staff involved, the group developed a new strategy, put a management team in place and rebranded as The Whole Company.  </p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The Whole Company A/S is best described as a conglomerate of trade companies in the food business, selling snacks, dried fruit products, tea, herbs, vinegar and nutritional supplements. The original activity was selling healthy snacks in small bags – nuts, dried fruits and so on – but through a number of acquisitions, the company now sells a range of food brands that in general offer a healthy alternative to end-users. The Whole Company’s direct customers are retailers. </p>\r\n<p>The company was founded in 1988 by Henrik Winther-Olsen, who is also the current owner of the company and the main source for this case study. He was educated at a commercial school and is ‘essentially an educated farmer’, as he puts it, but his management skills have been learned along the way – from an active use of advisors and from being a board member in other companies outside The Whole Company. </p>\r\n<p>The Whole Company is a holding company that owns different food brands in six separate companies, but with a common administration and with employees working across companies. The Whole Company is owned by Henrik Winther-Olsen, and he has a majority ownership in all subsidiary companies. The companies are managed by the same central management team of four to five people. Only daily operations are managed locally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Table 1: Subsidiary companies owned by The Whole Company </h4>\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""22.10%"">\r\n      <COL width=""43.90%"">\r\n      <COL width=""33.60%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>Company</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>Products/activity</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>HWO ownership stake<SUP>1</SUP> </b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Castus A/S</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Dried fruit snacks</p>\r\n<p>Vinegar</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>95%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Trope A/S</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Healthy snacks in bags</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>95%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Fredsted The A/S</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Tea and herbs</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>95%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Castus UK</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Dried fruit snacks</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>100%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Jemo-pharm A/S</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Nutritional supplements</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>76.4%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Real estate</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Ownership of facilities</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>100%</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p><SUP>1</SUP><i> HWO = Henrik Winther-Olsen</i></p>\r\n<p><i>Source: Henrik Winther-Olsen, owner of The Whole Company</i></p>\r\n<p>The company operates from three different locations in Denmark – Køge and Stege, south of Copenhagen, and Vadum in northern Jutland – and has a sales company in the United Kingdom. Jemo-pharm is located in Stege and produces nutritional supplements. Castus is located in Vadum and produces fruit snacks. </p>\r\n<p>Employees in The Whole Company are mainly in their forties – ‘about my age’, HWO points out, admitting that he would like to have more people in their twenties. Employees at the operational level are mainly unskilled, with a slight majority of women. </p>\r\n<p>Since 2006, employment grew from 40 to 67, with a temporary reduction in staff during 2008. Most staff are organised in trade unions. The company employs about 10 graduates, who, for example, have masters degrees in science or are chemical engineers or business school graduates. </p>\r\n<p>Most of the food brands are among the national leaders, and the company also has international ambitions for some of the brands. However, export to the UK is still just around 8% of turnover. </p>\r\n<p>In relation to corporate social responsibility (CSR), the company is aware of the 10 principles in the UN’s Global Compact and is doing preliminary research on its current status in relation to these. It wants to work on this issue, but is not yet ready to talk about it CSR activities in public.</p>\r\n<p>A human resource strategy was defined during a recent strategy process. </p>\r\n<p>The company has experienced constant growth in sales and employment since 2005. However, it experienced a net loss in 2008 and a general decrease in the EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) percentage at the time of the financial crisis in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Table 2: Earnings of The Whole Company, 2006–2010, DKK</h4>\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""26.20%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.60%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.60%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.60%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.60%"">\r\n      <COL width=""14.60%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n </TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2006</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2007</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2008</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2009</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>2010</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>Gross profit</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>31,165</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>39,833</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>41,111</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>50,607</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>58,579</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>EBITDA<SUP>1</SUP></b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>6,496</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>7,601</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>6,429</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>7,522</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>11,291</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p><b>Net profit</b></p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>6,315</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>4,295</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>-1,565</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>5,009</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>4,721</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p><SUP><i>1</i></SUP><i>EBITDA = </i> <i>earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation</i></p>\r\n<p><i>Source: Annual reports for The Whole Company</i></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring event described in this case study is an internal restructuring in management, with the purpose of establishing a management team and making the staff  in a group of companies see and understand themselves as one company, with common goals and values. However, the background to this internal restructuring in management has been a series of acquisitions that have created the need for a new management structure and a common identity. Therefore, the challenges of acquiring and integrating new companies are also mentioned during the case study.  </p>\r\n<p>Restructuring in the form of acquisitions has been an ongoing process in the company for more than a decade and a key to growth for The Whole Company. Since it is important to be the largest or second largest supplier to retailers in a product category, it has been a deliberate strategy to acquire new products or companies, but the individual acquisition has been more about current opportunities. However, around 2008 a series of internal and external events led to a major internal restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>Everything was moving very fast and the company was continually growing. Relocating the company in 2007 to new facilities in the same town (Køge) and moving the subsidiary Fredsted from Glostrup to the new headquarters in Køge took a lot of <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen’s</i><i> </i> management resources. Trope was acquired in 2008 and then suddenly the financial crisis came. This was a shock that made <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> stop and take a critical ‘helicopter view’ on his company. Do we still live by the values we had when we started? Are we still one company or are we separate units? Are we still working efficiently? Does the management system fit a company with more than 50 employees or are we still running it as a start-up? And do we actually know where we are heading?</p>\r\n<p>In 2009 these reflections led to a strategy development process involving all employees, the building of a management team and rebranding the group of companies under a common name – The Whole Company – from 2011. Until then, each company had been branded as separate entities. </p>\r\n<p><i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> remembers that during the high-growth period before 2008 the company had hired almost anybody who applied for a job – perhaps too many were hired. The financial crisis made the company stop and take a critical view on the organisation. Subsequently, eight people were laid off, and the organisation decreased to around 50 employees. </p>\r\n<p>One of the reasons why employment had run somewhat out of control could have been the relocation of the company in 2007 and also the move of subsidiary Fredsted The to the new facilities. This took up a lot of <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen’s</i> attention in that period. </p>\r\n<p>At that time, there was no real management team and no real common identity for the conglomerate, so <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> decided to start a strategy process in 2009 in order to build a new management structure that would be able to grow the company further. </p>\r\n<p>Like in many owner-managed companies, there is also a personal twist to the story. <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> is driven by continuous learning and forcing himself out of his comfort zone. After successfully building and developing a number of small companies, it was time to try his management skills on building a larger company by bringing the existing small companies under one umbrella. Therefore he set himself the aim of doubling the size of The Whole Company conglomerate within five years and developing a strategy and management team that could take the company to a new level. </p>\r\n<p>Alongside the strategy process, the company continued its acquisition strategy and acquired the brands or companies Trope, Urteteket, Womega and Jemo-pharm. Trope was actually a brand that the company had originally built and later sold to snack-market leader Kim’s in 2004, when <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> planned his early retirement. So in a way it was the original company that was bought back in 2008. Urteteket was a relatively small purchase of a brand that is now integrated in the headquarter operations. Jemo-pharm was a larger acquisition that still operates from a separate location.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Table 3: Timeline for the development of The Whole Company</h4>\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""13.00%"">\r\n      <COL width=""86.90%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>1988</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Henrik Winther-Olsen establishes the original company HWO Promotion</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>1990</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Trading in nuts and dried fruits</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>1992</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>The Trope brand is born (nuts and dried fruits products)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>1998</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Thekompagniet acquired (now part of Fredsted The)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>2002</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Castus acquired from Unilever (dried fruit snacks)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>2003</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Heidelberg Eddike (vinegar) acquired from Unilever</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>2004</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Trope sold to Kim’s (market leader in snacks)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>2006</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Fredsted The acquired (tea)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>2008</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Trope acquired back from Kim’s</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>2010</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Urteteket acquired (dried organic herbs; now part of Fredsted The) </p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>2010</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Womega acquired (nutritional supplements)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>2010</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>Jemo-pharm acquired (nutritional supplements)</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>2011</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\n<p>The Whole Company becomes the new common name for the group of companies</p>\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p><a HREF=""Source:%20www.thewholecompany.dk"">Source: www.thewholecompany.dk</a></p>\r\n<p>The acquisitions were not directly caused by external events, although the increasing size and purchasing power of customers has meant that it is important for The Whole Company to grow. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The process of developing a strategy and building a management team started in 2009 and lasted until the summer of 2011. </p>\r\n<p>A part of this process was defining a common brand name for the conglomerate of brands and a common identity for the company. Until then, only the brand names from each subsidiary were known to the public, and the common owner was just an anonymous holding company called HWO Holding A/S. The name was changed to The Whole Company in 2011.</p>\r\n<p>Decisions about acquisitions had been made by <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> alone, but for the strategy process he decided that he wanted a high level of involvement from the organisation. An external strategy coach was engaged to manage the process, and a management team was established internally from existing managers to be highly involved in the strategy process. During the process, all employees were also involved in defining the company values – and everybody got a personality profile (personality test). </p>\r\n<p>According to <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen,</i> the company had become too big and complex, so it was necessary to write down who was doing what and what had the highest priority. It took a couple of years to implement the strategy plan, and the strategy coach helped with building the management team until the summer of 2011.</p>\r\n<p>Operating staff were involved in defining the values early in the strategy process through a company workshop, and they also now meet twice a year for social and team-building events. At these events, staff received information about the key financial figures of the company, like sales, orders and costs and earnings. They get current information through a monthly newsletter. </p>\r\n<p>To keep in touch with each of the three physical locations in Denmark, <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen </i> pays quarterly visits to each location. </p>\r\n<p>The employee interviewee saw the information meetings as very valuable and informative, and points out that <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen </i> encourages the staff to ask questions when the key figures for the company are presented and explained. He admitted, though, that it could be difficult for some staff members to completely understand what the numbers mean. But, according to the employee, the meeting creates a sense of unity in the company, where people understand that a problem in another department is also their problem.</p>\r\n<p>An important part of the new growth strategy and a new management challenge for <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen </i> is international expansion. The Whole Company established Castus UK as a sales subsidiary in 2010, selling dried fruit snacks in the United Kingdom. This is still a minor activity, but an important part of the long-term strategy. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Running a comprehensive strategy process while still integrating and managing new acquisitions has obviously given The Whole Company a few challenges. </p>\r\n<p>For the factory manager, especially, the integration of acquisitions has been a big challenge, since he has had to travel frequently to different locations. It has been important for <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen </i> to build the company as a unified company and not as separate units with separate management. After the acquisition of Jemo-pharm, it actually considered running Jemo-pharm as a separate unit, but soon learned that management and administration would be too heavy that way. Now the only local management is a production manager. </p>\r\n<p>In the process of integrating and harmonising management practices, the management has learned also that not everything can be done in the same way across different locations. The company has to accept and adapt to regional differences. </p>\r\n<p>For <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen, </i> it has been important to maintain a flat structure in management to keep in touch with staff and to communicate that there is no difference in status between production and administration and that each should respect the other. </p>\r\n<p>In the process of building a management team and organising the company, the major challenges have been the shift in mindset of the team. </p>\r\n<p>One of the challenges in the transformation from entrepreneurial company to an established organisation has been to integrate strategic thinking in the organisation. As a small company with the execution virtues of entrepreneurship, it is challenging to integrate graduates in the company. But <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> acknowledges that long-term thinking and strategic planning is important for the company now, and he wants to employ more graduates in the company. </p>\r\n<p><i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> defined the overall goal as doubling sales within five years. The management team found this somewhat ambitious, but it forced them to focus on projects that had the highest impact on the overall goal. </p>\r\n<p>One learning outcome from the implementation of the strategy has been that too many strategic projects should not be prioritised. The original strategic plan had about 20 strategic projects. That was too many, so now only the big common projects like IT systems and new concepts are on the agenda for the management team. </p>\r\n<p>The ambitious goals have been a challenge in the Castus UK unit and that is a little behind schedule. According to <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen,</i> this is mainly due to the fact that recruiting a manager for international operations has taken longer than expected. Furthermore, entering the British retail market is an either-or situation, where the right customer can mean instant growth. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>All acquisitions in The Whole Company have been funded by bank loans without further problems. </p>\r\n<p>The Whole Company has not taken advantage of public advice and support schemes in the process, apart from some advice from the Trade Council under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in relation to exporting to and establishing a subsidiary in the UK market. The Trade Council offers free initial counselling and subsidised market research on new markets. </p>\r\n<p>However, Henrik Wither-Olsen actively uses advisors to the board and advisory board, and he is an active networker. </p>\r\n<p>One of the public schemes that he is currently considering is the Videnpilot scheme, where the company can get a subsidised graduate to work on research and other projects in the company. He also mentions that he would really like it if it was possible to receive subsidies for an energy-saving project. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main outcome of the internal restructuring process has been a stronger management structure for a larger and growing organisation. It has changed from entrepreneur management to team management. Furthermore, The Whole Company has become a more unified company, with common values and with a higher level of communication with employees. Finally, it has become a leaner organisation after the years of abundance leading up to 2008. </p>\r\n<p>According to <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen,</i> the company has traditionally been better at focusing on daily operations than long-term goals. However, the strategy process and setting ambitious goals has forced it to think more in terms of long-term growth and to focus on projects with higher impact. It has learned to say no to small projects and customers. </p>\r\n<p>Before the strategy process, there were no formal management meetings and no real management team. It was more like separate departments that were at times in conflict with each other. Today, the management team representing the different functions of sales, marketing, purchasing, financials and production has strategy meetings four times a year and a strategy plan running until 2014. However, the more specific planning is generally only for a year; changing conditions makes it hard to plan much further. The strategy process has meant that different functions and levels in the company respect each other more. They are working towards the same goals and help each other more. </p>\r\n<p>The personality profiles have been very valuable to people in understanding each other’s behaviour. ‘Some think it is fantastic when we grow, while others are less enthusiastic. But I have learned that the people who are less enthusiastic are also contributing’, <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> says. And getting to know each other better also means that they are better at dealing with conflicts directly and openly. Understanding each other’s personality profiles was also valuable at the operational level, where the employee interviewee reported that it was an active part of his daily communication with colleagues. </p>\r\n<p><i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> sees the restructuring process as a restart of the company and a mental shift from being a small entrepreneurial business to an established company. The company had grown so fast that it was hard to see the original company values in all the new employees. ‘We had become to self-complacent’, he says and points out that his motto is that ‘you always come out stronger after a crisis’. </p>\r\n<p>The strategy process has also led to a trimming of the organisation, and <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> perceives The Whole Company as a very lean organisation today. After the lay-off of eight people in 2008, the trimming has been gradual. The exception was Jemo-pharm, where staff were reduced from 28 to 22 after the acquisition, which was mentally tough on the organisation. Furthermore, the weekly work hours were harmonised upwards since Jemo-pharm had a shorter working week than the rest of the organisation. </p>\r\n<p>From an employee point of view, there was a calm reaction to the lay-offs in 2008. There was already a feeling that there was too little to do. Before the staff selected to be laid off were named, they received a lot of information about what would happen and why, and it was underlined that people were not laid off because they weren’t performing. Some of those who left have subsequently been recruited back to the company. </p>\r\n<p>From a personal perspective, another outcome of the restructuring was a learning opportunity for <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i>. His ambition is to learn how to run a bigger company and not just a small niche company. This also meant involving the management team in decisions, so while acquisitions were earlier made by <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> alone, the big 2010 acquisition of Jemo-pharm was planned by the management team. </p>\r\n<p>The acquisitions have had varying impacts on the company performance. Some have contributed strongly to profitability, whereas others had to be trimmed to be profitable. One learning outcome has been that buying small brands selling around DKK 5 million (€650,000) or less per year is not worth the effort. Because of the work involved in the process, new acquisitions should have an annual turnover of at least DKK 20–25 million. </p>\r\n<p>For production employees, the acquisitions involve work intensification or longer working hours. The extra workload depends on whether the acquisition must be integrated into current production or is run as a separate company. On one occasion, the integration of a new acquisition happened very fast and with little information in advance. This is probably why employees pointed out that ‘We like it when something new happens. This makes it interesting to work here, but also tough. But information is gold!’</p>\r\n<p>It also makes things more complicated – or ‘advanced’ as the employee interviewee said – to manage products from separate companies in one order, but for the employee it was a better feeling that he was now handling larger orders. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>In his reflections on differences between SMEs and big corporations, <i>Henrik Winther-Olsen</i> points out that a large corporation has more financial resources and more skilled and experienced employees who may have undergone the process before. On the other hand, an SME is faster and more dynamic, but the challenge is that employees are also occupied by daily operations in the restructuring process. ‘We can’t just take out five people for a month’, according to <i>Mr Winther-Olsen</i>. </p>\r\n<p>When asked about what he would do differently, the only thing he mentions is that he would not buy companies or brands that are too small, as mentioned above. </p>\r\n<p>The employee interviewed had worked in a large retail chain before and found that it was very valuable in an SME to have direct access to the owner or top management. ‘We in the store are experienced people from the retail industry, and we know a problem when we see it, so we just go to the management and tell them.’ His experience is that in large corporations some ideas are never uttered because the path to the decision-makers is too long. In addition, if each business unit perceives itself as a separate entity, it starts to function sub-optimally and avoids sticking out – top or bottom – because it attracts attention from top management. </p>\r\n<p><i>Henrik Winther-Olsen’s</i> opinion on public support schemes is that they are often too general. He would like to see more targeted programmes for companies with growth potential and recommends that companies focus their resources on a few large projects for committed companies. Furthermore, he mentions the strict and inflexible administration of food security regulations as a major administrative constraint for the company. </p>\r\n<p>In his advice to other SMEs who want to do the same, <i>Mr Winther-Olsen</i> recommends using advisors and sparring partners in the process and getting strong competences in-house. And, finally, he highlights the importance of always knowing whether you are making money at the present time. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Jan Bendtsen, Syddansk Universitet, Kolding. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Henrik Winther-Olsen, Founder and owner–manager </p>\r\n<p>An employee working in the storehouse at The Whole Company in Køge</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>The Whole Company A/S</p>\r\n<p>Unionsvej 4</p>\r\n<p>DK-4600 Køge</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.thewholecompany.dk/"">http://www.thewholecompany.dk/</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3>\r\n<p>Annual reports for 2008, 2009 and 2010</p>\r\n<p>Articles available at <a HREF=""http://www.thewholecompany.dk/Presse_TheWholeCompany.html"">http://www.thewholecompany.dk/Presse_TheWholeCompany.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Denmark"~"10 - manufacture of food products"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring*merger / acquisition"~"2012-02-07"
"Trosa Tryckeri, Sweden"~"Trosa Tryckeri"~"<p>The Swedish printing business Trosa Tryckeri was established in 1919 and bought by the family of the current CEO in 1982. An unsuccessful acquisition in 2008 exposed it to likely bankruptcy and it was forced to apply for corporate reconstruction. One-third of the staff (20 people) were given notice and the remaining staff worked with management and the reconstruction administrator to save the company. In the end, only eight people had to leave the company and it has been successfully restructured.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Founded in 1919, Trosa Tryckeri is a printing business involved in graphic production. The business produces four main products: traditional printed matter, wall calendars, store advertising and packages. When the Lundberg family bought Trosa Tryckeri in 1982, the company had 15 employees. The company has grown and merged with other companies and at its peak had 69 employees. Today, the company has about 50 employees and 15 seasonal employees during the high production period in the autumn.</p>\r\n<p>The company is divided into three different departments &ndash; sales, administration and bookbinding, all located in the town of Trosa.</p>\r\n<p>Within the administration, most employees are recruited from other companies within the same industry. In the production unit at Trosa Tryckeri, the majority are trained as apprentices, and thereafter they develop within the company and take up other positions, such as project leader. The workforce is a balanced mix of men and women, with slightly more men, and the average age is 40 years old.</p>\r\n<p>The business isn&rsquo;t directly international since the customers in general are Swedish and local. However, some customers are active globally and have English as their corporate language. Trosa Tryckeri prints in multiple languages and distributes worldwide. It also works with brokers in England working for Swedish clients. Trosa Tryckeri sometimes distributes products directly to Asia; however, most clients are situated in the Stockholm region.</p>\r\n<p>The company has an operations handbook that includes management process protocol and job descriptions, and this is developed continuously since the company works actively on quality and environmental issues. There is no human resource manager in the company; however, there are managers in charge of the different units and a manager of quality and environmental issues. The company has several certifications which it follows in its production in order to improve operations.</p>\r\n<p>Trosa Tryckeri is a member of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, an employer organisation. Connection to trade unions is low. Most of the trade union members are white-collar workers, while less than 50% of blue-collar workers are enrolled in a union.</p>\r\n<p>For the last few years, the company has experienced falling profits and sales. In 2008, it decided to acquire a company from a bankrupt competitor. It recruited employees from this company, but results did not turn out as expected. In 2009, all of the recruited people left the company and profits were insufficient to cover costs. As a result of this, Trosa Tryckeri applied for a company reconstruction under Swedish law in August 2010, which ended in May 2011. Now the business is stable and recruiting employees to its sales department again.</p>\r\n<p>Marie Lundberg, together with her husband and son, owns the company. Her family bought the company from the former owners in 1982, and since then she has worked at Trosa Tryckeri in sales and marketing, and currently she is the CEO. Her educational background is elementary school, and before she acquired Trosa Tryckeri, she worked night shift at the police department. While working at her former job, she started a part-time printing paper broker business. That was how she got involved in the printing business, which led to the decision to buy Trosa Tryckeri.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008, the company experienced an increase in its business and made investments in a bankrupt company, recruiting the employees of that company. This was, looking back, a bad decision since the company&rsquo;s profit and sales went down. The unsuccessful acquisition and recruitment led to a crisis where the company, after getting advice from a lawyer, realised that if it did not apply for a corporate reconstruction, it would probably go bankrupt within two to three years. When the management realised this, it took less than a month to decide to apply for and start a reconstruction process. Other options considered before they decided to go through corporate reconstruction were to find a partner, sell parts of the company or find a financier. However, they realised that it was too late to choose anything else but corporate reconstruction.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The management team, the board and the owners were involved in the decision. Together with the reconstruction administrator, a legal official appointed by the court, they investigated where the company was bleeding money and where it was making a profit. They realised that parts of the production could be outsourced, and therefore they announced they would give notice to 20 people, one-third of the work force. Marie Lundberg invited the local newspaper as soon as they had filed for reconstruction. There was no speculation in the press before the announcement was official.</p>\r\n<p>A corporate reconstruction is formally planned and implemented and has to follow specific rules under Swedish law. Any business that has severe difficulties paying its debts has the opportunity to establish a specific procedure to reconstruct its business. Companies applying for reconstruction have to complete it within one year, and the process consists of four three-month phases.</p>\r\n<p>For Trosa Tryckeri, the reconstruction was completed after three phases, lasting nine months from August 2010 to May 2011. The reconstruction administrator was made responsible for ensuring that the subcontractors to Trosa Tryckeri got paid, and he guaranteed they would get their payment. During the process, the reconstruction administrator took over Trosa Tryckeri&rsquo;s account, and the company had to have permission from the reconstruction administrator before buying anything worth more than SEK 10,000 (&euro;1,130). This guarantee made the subcontractors stay with Trosa Tryckeri even though the company had informed them it was in trouble early on.</p>\r\n<p>The first months were very intense, and the management adjusted the plan as they went along. For instance, one initial idea was to outsource many of the company production units; however, they realised this would be less profitable than to keep the production within the company.</p>\r\n<p>Trosa Tryckeri has a meeting with the entire workforce every month to inform the workers of ongoing developments and the condition of the company. When management realised what path the company was taking, they gathered the workers to inform them. The reaction was a mix of anxiety that positions were going to be cut and a constructive &lsquo;we can solve this&rsquo; attitude. Some workers had never worked anywhere besides Trosa Tryckeri, and these employees became especially concerned since they had never applied for another job and did not want to leave.</p>\r\n<p>The workers were not involved in the decision to undertake corporate reconstruction but did participate in every three-month phase of the implementation. Together the workers, the managers and the administrator tried to find solutions in order to prevent the company from going bankrupt. The trade union was only present when the notice was given to staff but did not object to the decision, since it understood the lay-offs were a necessary part of the reconstruction and not personal.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenge for Trosa Tryckeri was that when it informed its bank that it would apply for corporate reconstruction, the bank froze the company account and left it without credit. It had no economic support from public bodies, so the reconstruction was financed entirely by the company. As a consequence, it had to be extra careful and bill clients right away in order to ensure income was stable during the period. One thing Marie Lundberg would have done differently given her recent experience is she would not have told the bank early about the company restructuring. They had two choices: tell the bank afterwards or go to the bank before the restructuring was official. They decided to go to the bank before they applied for reconstruction. The bank froze all their accounts and suspended their credit. In hindsight, she would have gone to the bank afterwards as it can be assumed that the bank would have been more cooperative when approached by the administrator rather than by the company. Today the company has a different bank.</p>\r\n<p>Another challenge concerned how the company would convince clients to stay with it during the restructuring. Marie Lundberg had a dialogue every three months with the main clients to inform them of how the restructuring was going and to give an update. Only one client terminated its contract, and Trosa Tryckeri lost one job to a completely new client who believed the company was too unstable and therefore withdrew the order. Other clients kept their confidence in Trosa Tryckeri and stayed.</p>\r\n<p>The company also put a lot of effort into assuring clients that it was committed and trustworthy, in order to persuade subcontractors to continue delivering the necessary equipment so that production could be maintained. The reconstruction administrator took much responsibility in this work and convinced them to stay, assuring them that the debts to suppliers and subcontractors would be paid</p>\r\n<p>According to Marie Lundberg, for SMEs it is harder to take decisions, and as a result, they wait too long before starting the restructuring process. Large companies act faster and have a better overview of fluctuations in the economy. Large companies also have a better view of European conditions and of sectors where they are active. Furthermore, larger companies have more opportunities to educate their workforce when production goes down. They can go down to four-day working weeks and still always have someone present at the enterprise. Conversely, SMEs may not be as aware of possible restructuring strategies and lack a clear overview of the situation. An SME with a smaller workforce can&rsquo;t reduce one unit in the same way. Mrs. Lundberg concludes that SMEs might have a disadvantage when it comes to one unit making demands on another. In a larger enterprise, the sales unit might place specific requirements on another unit and the production unit might in the same way place demands on the HR manager in order to make production more efficient. In an SME, it is harder to place specific demands on another unit within the company since personal in different departments are close and find it difficult to make straight demands on one another since they are friends working together.</p>\r\n<p>However, according to Marie Lundberg, SMEs might be more flexible and have better customer contact, which makes customers more reliable. Large companies probably have less personal contact with their clients, making them more vulnerable in times of restructuring.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Marie Lundberg concludes that the company has received the support that it needed and that the advice and guidance from the reconstruction administrator was particularly helpful. He had experience from similar situations, and together they worked out a solution. Also the lawyers advising the company to apply for corporate reconstruction did this at the right stage.</p>\r\n<p>It was difficult at times when every cost over SEK 10,000 (&euro;1,130) had to be approved by the administrator, since the company has a turnover of over SEK 80 million (&euro;904,500). However, the administrator tried to improve the administration as much as he could.</p>\r\n<p>There are no specific recommendations regarding public support. Trosa Tryckeri had great help from the reconstruction administrator. The company received the governmental salary guarantee, meaning the state paid the salaries during the period and the company are repaying this loan today. The government is obliged to pay the workers if the company is unable to do so due to bankruptcy or corporate reconstruction.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Initially, 20 people were given notice that their employment was to be terminated. This number was adjusted to 16 and in the end 12 were given notice. Of these 12, 4 were given notice that they could stay but only on a part-time basis. Today, these four employees are back full-time again. So, in total, eight people had to leave the company. Some still return as seasonal workers during the autumn production. The company adjusted the numbers given notice because it realised it could keep some more employees than anticipated by its initial forecast, as production increased.</p>\r\n<p>The employees made redundant had to leave right away and received compensation of six to twelve months&rsquo; salary. The company tried actively to find new positions in other companies for the workers made redundant. Some have been offered to work temporarily on piecework assignments, and others were encouraged to start a training course.</p>\r\n<p>The sales department was the unit most affected during the process since this was the least efficient area. It outsourced some work in order to cut costs and this caused positions to be made redundant. Since some positions were cut, some tasks were delegated to other workers; however, this has been positively received by the remaining workforce.</p>\r\n<p>The reconstruction turned out better than expected. Production has improved and become more efficient. The company has learned a great deal by this experience on every level. It also managed to withdraw some of the proposed lay-offs since production increased.</p>\r\n<p>Marie Lundberg has not experienced any personal effects of the restructuring. The value of the company might have gone down, but she has learned a lot during the process. The company has become more careful with expenses and has begun to outsource some production. Regarding salaries, Trosa Tryckeri has not been able to raise salaries in the last year; however, everyone gets paid according to their contracts.</p>\r\n<p>The company works on a long-term business plan and has just initiated the development of one-year, three-year and five-year strategies for the business. It reviews its business ideas and has asked different work teams to give input to this development in order to make everyone aware of the vision of the company. So far, many good ideas have been developed within these groups consisting of employees from different production units.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Trosa Tryckeri experienced a very formal reconstruction, which explains the focus on the business rather than on employees in this case study. If the company hadn&rsquo;t applied for a corporate reconstruction, it would probably have gone bankrupt. This case study also offers an example of how important it is, in times of restructuring, to find a way to stay trustworthy and keep clients. The fact that the loss of a big client can mean the end of the business is a clear vulnerability for SMEs compared to larger companies. Therefore, in this type of situation, support from an experienced reconstruction administrator can really save the company by guaranteeing the payments to subcontractors and by giving strategic guidance on how to enable a business in a downward spiral survive.</p>\r\n<p>Marie Lundberg has learnt that a person cannot run a company with their heart. The CEO has to look at the needs of the company and figure out if all the positions are necessary. They have to look at the circumstances of the company and act. There is no reason to maintain a stance that the company delivers everything on its own and never outsources, if this is less profitable than to outsource.</p>\r\n<p>Marie Lundberg recommends other companies in the same position to inform the workforce early and keep them in the loop in order to prevent anxiety among the workers. Also, it is important to be one step ahead of the newspapers so that it doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise for the workers that reconstruction is on the way.</p>\r\n<p>If an enterprise is experiencing difficulties, it is, in Marie Lundberg&rsquo;s opinion, important to look into what possibilities are available. The reconstruction administrator concluded that Trosa Tryckeri was one of few companies taking action on time. Most companies wait too long to start a reconstruction process. When they finally start, it is too late, and they realise after three months that they will not succeed. Even though it might be awkward to admit that there are problems within the company, it is important to take action early and try to solve them, using guidance from experienced administrators and lawyers.</p>\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Jan Persson and Ingrid Broman, Oxford Research</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<h3>Interview</h3>\r\n<p>Marie Lundberg, chief executive officer</p>\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Trosa Tryckeri AB</p>\r\n<p>Regeringsgatan 93</p>\r\n<p>111 39 Stockholm</p>\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.trosatryckeri.se/"">http://www.trosatryckeri.se/</a></p>"~"Sweden"~"18 - printing and reproduction of recorded media"~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"(avoiding) bankruptcy"~"2012-03-16"
"TWO Services, United Kingdom"~"TWO Services Limited"~"<p>In 2008–2009 TWO Services (a family-run cleaning, repair and maintenance business in the UK) reacted to slowing demand and growing competition with actions to cut costs and generate revenue. These included reducing prices, cutting costs  (advertising and fuel for transport), maintaining staff levels and seeking to grow business. The main restructuring events of recent years were opening a new office in 2009 and a new telesales department in 2010 as part of a strategic adjustment to build the business even in a challenging market.  </p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Established in 1986 in Basildon, Essex, TWO Services is a family-run cleaning, repair and maintenance business that operates across the UK. The business is registered – TWO Services Ltd – and divided into three operations. In the current form, it offers the following services: </p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>TWO Catering Equipment Supply &amp; Maintenance: this\r\nincludes maintenance of catering and refrigeration equipment, gas and electrical\r\nmaintenance, breakdown repair of kitchen equipment, and an emergency response\r\nservice; </li>\r\n<li>TWO Kitchen Hygiene Services: deep-cleaning of kitchens,\r\nincluding ventilation systems, all equipment, walls, ceilings and\r\nfloors;</li>\r\n<li>TWO Daily Cleaning: cleaning of commercial premises and\r\noffices, including the cleaning of windows and carpets, and dusting.\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The first two services are in most demand, each representing around 45 % of the business. The company started as a kitchen cleaning business but gradually introduced supply, maintenance and repair of equipment in the mid-1990s, initially as a separate company. This was, however, creating too much administrative work, and so the directors decided to incorporate the second company into the existing TWO Services Ltd. Since 2008, the demand for maintenance of equipment has increased as a result of recession. In the difficult financial times, many clients have opted to have their kitchen equipment repaired and cleaned rather than purchasing new equipment. </p>\r\n<p>Alan Osborn is one of the five directors of TWO Services and chairman of the company. Mr Osborn used to be a chef in the 1960s in hotels and later moved into industrial catering. He was made redundant in 1985 and then opened his own business, a catering consultancy, in 1986. Soon after, the business focus changed from catering to cleaning services, following the owner’s experience of taking on a cleaning job which proved more profitable.   </p>\r\n<p>Over the years, the business has expanded from south-east England to the rest of the country, with offices in Basildon, London and Leeds. TWO Services works with most of the leading catering contractors in the business and industry market. The catering contractors that provide catering to big blue-chip companies would usually nominate TWO Services to be their supplier of kitchen cleaning and maintenance and for equipment supply and installation for their catering contracts or tenders. If the contractors are successful in winning the tender, then  TWO Services also gets the job. The company works for individual restaurants but also directly for major facilities management companies, along with large businesses within the UK. It also works for the public sector, hospitals, care homes and charity organisations. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Osborn is nearing retirement and has passed responsibilities to his sons, who are both directors. The business has grown massively over the past 25 years, from employing 2 people in 1986 to 120 in 2012. The company prides itself for building relationships with clients, offering good quality service, and investing in its staff. As a family business, the motto of TWO Services is ‘It takes two’.  </p>\r\n<p>TWO Services has a written corporate social responsibility policy and a human resource (HR) policy. Its first HR policy was developed in the 1990s. Over the years, as the business expanded, it sought the services of an outside consultant to help it develop a new policy and quality operating standards. The company holds management meetings on a monthly basis to discuss company performance and any issues. </p>\r\n<p>TWO Services is accredited under the government’s Contractors Health and Safety scheme (CHAS) and the safecontractor Health and Safety Assessment scheme. Moreover, the company holds various quality ISO certifications, including quality management systems (ISO 9001:2008), environmental management systems (ISO 14001), and occupational health and safety management systems (OHSAS 18001).     </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008–2009, TWO Services took a number of actions, both cost-cutting and revenue-generating measures, in response to slowing demand and growing competition. Its main competitors targeted the company’s clients by offering to charge 10% less than TWO Services for the same work. In order to maintain the existing level of profits, the company took steps to increase turnover and cut costs. </p>\r\n<p>To enable it to maintain a high-quality service, TWO Services decided to readjust costs rather than cut down on staff. It reduced prices by 20 % in order to retain the existing customer base. At the same time, it continued to provide a quality service for a value price rather than trying to be cheap. It reduced its prices but only up to a point where it was not making loss. Other measures TWO Services have taken to cut costs include putting speed limiters on vans so they can only drive at a maximum of 70 miles an hour, and trackers, which make them more fuel efficient. It has also put duel-fuel vehicles on road and purchased a number of Toyota Prius vehicles. These hybrid vehicles can be propelled by both <a HREF=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline"">gasoline</a> and electric power, which makes them one of the most fuel-efficient cars.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Osborn notes that there are more people entering the kitchen-cleaning market. As a result of much stricter food safety regulations, there is a greater demand for kitchen-cleaning services and therefore more opportunities in the industry. While competitors may have taken advantage of the recession by offering cheaper services and thus attracting clients who look for savings in difficult times, they are not a serious threat to the company in the longer term. The directors believe that many are short on the quality of services, qualifications and public liability insurance that TWO Services offers. </p>\r\n<p>Despite the slowing demand, TWO Services was able to increase sales gradually. Its income has been  increasing steadily. Rather than retrench during the recession, the company decided to expand its business. The main restructuring events undertaken in recent years have been the opening up of a new office in 2009 and a new telesales department in 2010 associated with strategic adjustment.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The owners had been planning to expand the business for some time and considered opening a telesales department as part of their plans for 2009–2011. The telesales department was intended to cover all services. The motivation was to increase the client base and subsequently turnover as a way of keeping its profit margins at a level consistent with previous years. </p>\r\n<p>The company sales department had always been ‘reactive’: when a request was made for quotation, someone was sent to quote. It was decided to change this approach so that sales staff would make a proactive contact with companies and increase the client base. A telesales person was employed in 2008, but this did not work out for both parties, and it proved to be difficult to get the right people.</p>\r\n<p>The company advertised the telesales positions a number of times over 2008 but no suitable candidates came forward for the roles. In early 2010, a company near the head office in Essex, which used to sell office machines, photocopiers and fax machines, was acquired by a large multinational firm, and the staff were made redundant. This company had a telesales department, so TWO Services took this opportunity to recruit, offering the vacant sales positions to two experienced sales staff from the acquired company, who both had a good track record. The employees took redundancy payment from their previous employer and almost immediately started working for TWO Services. </p>\r\n<p>The telesales department, with two new employees, started working at the beginning of 2010. Initially, the sales staff had to learn to understand the business and its requirements and needs in relation to kitchen cleaning and maintenance. They were given specific training for this. To familiarise themselves with the business operations and the services offered, they were taken out by the company’s sales manager to visit various operations. The employees also underwent an internet-based training programme, covering health and safety, environment and driving, as part of the company standards. </p>\r\n<p>Apart from the two telesales staff, the company recruited another five external people during that time. A northern office was opened in November of the same year, as the volume of new business in the north was increasing. Three employees moved from the south to the new office, one as northern operations manager and one as cleaning supervisor. The other employees were employed locally from advertising. TWO Services had far too many applications for the remaining positions.  </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring event was financed from internal funds obtained by reducing advertising expenditure in the Yellow Pages in 2009. This has enabled TWO Services to cover the additional overhead cost of the new staff.   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>In order to open a new telesales department, TWO Services needed to recruit experienced sales staff. This has been a challenge for the company as this is not a job for just anyone, due to the nature of this type of work. Additionally, the company had an issue with one new employee who was quite strong minded, and it took a time for that person to adjust to the new working conditions and the type of services being sold. This, however, was soon resolved and their work generally improved.   </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company received advice and support from two business consultants regarding the development of an integrated quality management system, including the environment policy, health and safety policy, and staff induction training programmes. It did not seek any specific advice during the restructuring process, but its management plans were developed with the help of these two consultants, who have worked with the company since 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The new telesales department proved to be a success for the company. As a consequence, it has employed seven new staff members. Having dedicated sales staff enabled the company to set itself targets. Deals are now regularly closed by making appointments via telephone and visiting clients face-to-face. The company introduced a bonus payment for the sales staff. The staff work towards targets and receive a bonus payment if they meet the target. This has increased the volume of sales. </p>\r\n<p>While previously the company was rather reactive, mainly responding to clients’ queries and providing quotes, it has since become more proactive by telephoning existing and potential clients and trying to bring in new business. Moreover, the process has become more organised. The telesales department keeps records of sales and can make comparisons with previous years. The information is recorded in a sales database so that all staff have access to it and can plan visits without duplication. As a result, they have become much more efficient. </p>\r\n<p>Opening a telesales department has also affected the existing employees. Due to the increase in sales, the sales staff who go out to meet clients and complete quotes have become busier. There is also an increase in the volume of work for staff organising and arranging dates and times and for employees undertaking the cleaning and maintenance work. </p>\r\n<p>Anne Haydock is the contract manager for the Maintenance Department. Her role is to administer all documentation related to new contracts, to do quotes and to respond to queries. Anne previously worked for the NHS. She started working for the company in 2007 on a part-time basis, 25 hours a week. Due to increased volume of work generated through the telesales department but also the growing demand for maintenance services in recent years, her workload has also increased in terms of quotes and documents that she has to process.  Ms. Haydock subsequently moved into a full-time position in 2011, which has been a positive development for her personally.  </p>\r\n<p>Laurence Freeman joined the company in 1996, initially working as a cleaner. About six years ago when an employee went on maternity leave, Mr Freeman progressed into a managerial role and became responsible for office cleaning services. When TWO Services introduced the telesales division, it started to produce more opportunities, increasing sales. At the time, Mr Freeman was offered the position of sales manager. This was not a vacant position advertised externally. As the business started to expand, TWO Services required more sales staff and tried to draw from its existing human resources. As a sales manager, Mr. Freeman meets clients face-to-face and converts quotes into sales. Although he did not have any prior sales experience, he had a working knowledge of kitchen and office cleaning. Mr. Freeman attended several training courses for the role in order to learn how to price jobs and provide quotes for customers. Becoming a sales manager has been a positive experience in terms of personal progress, job satisfaction, financial rewards as well as company benefits such as having a company car, mobile phone and laptop. </p>\r\n<p>In terms of net profit, 2009 was one of the best years ever for TWO Services. In 2010, the company sales were higher than in 2009 as a result of restructuring. However, due to the investments made into the new office and the additional overhead cost of seven new full-time employees, profit margins in 2010 were lower than in 2009. Calling and getting in touch with previous clients has helped the company maintain its profile in the market place. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The case study of TWO Services provides an example of a company with a successful expansion strategy in difficult economic circumstances. The restructuring was associated with strategic reorientation in response to shifting demand patterns. The recession has strengthened rather than weakened the business. The company has capitalised on its strong market and financial positions, using these to expand the business by opening a new office in the north of England and a new telesales department in the head office. As a result, it has employed additional people as well as making use of its existing human resources to strengthen sales and organisation of work. Increasing its turnover meant that the company was able to drop its prices and still retain good profit margins and good quality of service. </p>\r\n<p>For Alan Osborn, the main lesson learnt from the restructuring event is the importance of having the right employees, with experience and knowledge, who can do the work and who have the right attitude. In the case of TWO Services, the sales employees need to be confident communicators and be able to use certain techniques to elicit information from potential clients and to get them interested in talking in order to sell the service. Potential clients can often be abusive on the telephone, so this work requires a strong personality. The experience of restructuring would not have been positive and the subsequent increase in sales would not have occurred without having the right team of people in place. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Osborn believes that the company has made the right decisions at the right time. It has also been lucky to operate in the services industry, which has not been severely hit by the recession. The director’s understanding is that people still have to go out and eat and still spend money on food. TWO Services has taken advantage of its strong financial position by implementing measures that can put it in an even stronger position when the crisis is over and clients are ready to spend again. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Eva Kašperová, Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University </p>\r\n<p>David Smallbone, Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University</p>\r\n<p>John Kitching, Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Alan Osborn, owner and chairman </p>\r\n<p>Anne Haydock, contract manager</p>\r\n<p>Laurence Freeman, sales manager</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>TWO Services Limited</p>\r\n<p>2-3 Hovefields Lodge</p>\r\n<p>Burnt Mills</p>\r\n<p>Basildon</p>\r\n<p>Essex, SS13 1EB</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.two-services.com/"">http://www.two-services.com/</a> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"United Kingdom"~"81 - services to buildings and landscape activities"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"greening*recession/crisis"~"business expansion"~"2012-02-22"
"Vialle, the Netherlands"~"Vialle"~"<p>In the Netherlands, alternative fuel systems provider Vialle carried out restructuring in 2009 including 60 redundancies as it faced bankruptcy. However it grew again shortly afterwards, from 60 to 70 staff, and had to be reorganised once more in 2010. The second restructuring involved a newly formed works council that did not exist in 2009 and took a different approach to the smaller number of redundancies involved. The company has now resumed growth and by early 2012 once again had 70 staff in a market boosted by rising fuel prices.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile </h2>\r\n<p>Vialle develops and manufactures alternative fuel systems. The company is involved in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), diesel-blend, natural gas and dimethyl ether technologies. Vialle distributes the advanced liquid LPG injection (LPi) system, currently enjoying great popularity in cars. Its excellent performance, maintenance-free operation and very high reliability puts the LPi liquefied petroleum gas system ahead of the field. </p>\r\n<p>Vialle and BK-Gas (another Dutch supplier of LPG) together developed GasFX. Vialle and BK-Gas supply consumer and commercial markets in the Netherlands with an LPi package, including installation, service, guarantee and fuel discounts. The system is supplied in many commercial markets and countries, both through the network of installation centres as well as in collaboration with car manufacturers and importers. </p>\r\n<p>Established in 1967 in Eindhoven, the business is a private limited liability company and began by importing parts for liquefied petroleum gas installations from Italy. As a result of the 1970s oil crisis, Vialle grew and quickly became the market leader for liquefied petroleum gas installations in the Netherlands – a position the company still holds today. In less than 15 years the company grew from a trading company to a manufacturer with its own research and development capability. Some management members hold shares and there is also a co-investor. </p>\r\n<p>Driven by the sharp increase in interest from car manufacturers and high demands from motorists, manufacturing activities were gradually outsourced to third parties in the 1990s. This allowed Vialle to focus on new product development and quality improvement. </p>\r\n<p>Vialle employs approximately 70 people, divided fairly equally among technical, assembly and administrative departments. Approximately 10% of sales are in the Netherlands; the rest are from the EU, Asia and the Pacific. </p>\r\n<p>Peter Rutten has been chief executive (and one of the owners) since 2002, as well as a major shareholder and director. Auke Faber started working for Vialle in 2006 and has been head of the works council since 2010. Both have been interviewed for this case study. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event </h2>\r\n<p>Vialle has reorganised three times in the past 10 years, once in 2001–2002, again in 2009 and then in 2010. This case study is mainly about the 2009 and 2010 reorganisations. The company was successful in the period leading up to reorganisation in 2009. In 2008, turnover doubled compared to 2007, mainly due to increasing fuel prices. Rising prices encouraged consumers to use LPi in their cars. However, growth suddenly stopped in 2009 because of the economic crisis, which saw orders decline drastically – to 5% of the level of 2008 (a very successful year). The company reduced employment in 2009, but it wasn’t enough. The company increased the workforce after reorganisation by about 10 employees, but this occurred too quickly and so in 2010 jobs had to be cut again. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>There was no works council during the reorganisation in 2009. Vialle management asked employees if they wanted to form one, but no one did. Management introduced a plan, with the guidance of a private legal office, to ensure there were no legal problems with the process because of the absence of a work council.</p>\r\n<p>The 2009 restructuring plan was limited: it mainly described the process regarding the reorganisation. The company was at the edge of bankruptcy, so drastic measures were needed. The management decided who was going to be made redundant and the redundant employees received minimal compensation. If the employees voluntarily ended their contracts, they could get 100% compensation for their loss of wages in the first month after termination. Because of the urgency, there was a very tight timetable and everything had to be arranged in a couple of months. The process was finalised according to this timetable.</p>\r\n<p>The management informed employees of the restructuring plans and decisions concerning their employment in one-to-one talks. A couple of lawsuits from redundant employees are still running but so far court rulings have been in favour of Vialle.</p>\r\n<p>After the 2009 reorganisation, the company grew from 60 to 70 employees. But, looking back, this growth perhaps took place too quickly because the organisation had to be downsized again in 2010. After this reorganisation, the company grew again to about 70 employees (early 2012).</p>\r\n<p>Before the 2010 reorganisation, a works council was formed as a mutual employer–worker initiative: the management wanted a works council and there were employees who wanted to be part of it. The management plans for the reorganisation were shown to the council, before being communicated to the workforce. One works council member, however, leaked the plans to the media, causing considerable employee unrest, so speed was of the essence.</p>\r\n<p>The works council agreed with management that downsizing was the only option. They made some minor requests regarding the departments where people were going to lose their jobs. Some positions/departments were vital for the continuation of Vialle. The management agreed to their suggestions.</p>\r\n<p>Following the works council agreement, management took a different approach from the one taken during the previous, larger, 2009 reorganisation. They invited all the employees from a specific department to a meeting at which they informed the group who was going to be let go; this was followed by one-to-one talks with these employees.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Looking back, the 2009 restructuring was not drastic enough, and the subsequent growth was not a good idea. After 2009, work pressure on remaining employees increased, leading to a rise in sick leave, and Vialle incurred extra costs because of this.</p>\r\n<p>The main challenge for the 2009 reorganisation was the absence of a work council. A company without one generally has to wait one month before the public office in charge of national insurance (UWV Werkbedrijf) will issue a collective discharge permit. However Vialle’s problems were so great and speed was so essential that the Minister of Social Affairs and Employment (<i>Sociale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid</i>) had to sign the plans to get priority at the ‘UWV Werkbedrijf’. </p>\r\n<p>The main challenge in the 2010 reorganisation was the leaking of restructuring plans to the media. Employees were understandably alarmed given the downsizing that had occurred the year before.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>For both the 2009 and 2010 restructuring events management sought legal advice from a service provider with whom they had previously done business. Compulsory redundancies are not to be taken lightly because of their complexity and the financial/economic implications and advice and guidance is necessary.</p>\r\n<p>For the 2009 reorganisation, the <i>UWV WEKRbedrijf</i> gave a presentation and information to employees regarding the consequences of dismissal. This was a joint initiative by the public office and management. Since works councils are made up of company employees, they don’t necessarily have experience in dealing with management restructuring plans. Vialle therefore paid for advice from a private expert regarding severance arrangements. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The most important effect of restructuring was on employment numbers. In 2009, employment decreased 50% from approximately 120 to 60. Following the 2009 reorganisation, the workforce grew by 10 employees, but then had to be decreased again to about 60 employees. </p>\r\n<p>The 2009 reorganisation led to a number of employee-related challenges. First, reorganisation produced a large increase in employee workload, with a subsequent rise in sick leave. There was also an unexpected problem in the form of feelings of guilt among the retained employees. This is something that received more attention during the 2010 reorganisation. For example, one employee offered to resign in place of a dismissed employee. Such emotions are very difficult to manage, underlining the point that retained, as well as newly redundant, employees often need support during a reorganisation. Third, downsizing affected workforce expertise as skilled employees had to go. </p>\r\n<p>The current forecasts for Vialle are good. After a turbulent couple of years, the company is growing again. By the beginning of 2012 it employed 70 people, and with increasing fuel prices, LPi systems should have a lot of potential growth. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary </h2>\r\n<p>Employees to be made redundant were approached differently in the 2009 and 2010 reorganisations, and both approaches worked. Because of the large group affected in the 2009 reorganisation, an individual approach to handling redundancies worked. All employees got time with management to talk about reorganisation motives and effects. </p>\r\n<p>In the 2010 reorganisation, a team approach worked very well, because they were very close-knit teams and employees could be informed quickly. So there is no ‘one best way’ of dealing with this kind of situation. If redundancies were to happen again, the management would again carefully consider how to tell individual employees. </p>\r\n<p>Management–works council relations are important influences on restructuring processes. When relations are poor, discussing plans can be difficult. In this case, the works council had no complaints about the process.  </p>\r\n<p>A very important learning point for management is to be firm when deciding the number of employees that has to go. Perhaps, if management had not been so ‘friendly’ during and after the 2009 reorganisation, the 2010 reorganisation might not have been necessary. </p>\r\n<p>However, the chief executive emphasises that every situation is unique. This is why legal advice is very useful.  The chief executive, while working for a previous company, downsized a workforce from 560 employees to 140. On that larger scale, one looks less at individual employees. It is a much more personal process in a small or medium enterprise, where management knows the individual employees. Furthermore, he is also a part-owner of the company. This means that one looks differently at restructuring events, because one is more financially involved in the company. It is important that one is personally involved and that one empathises with all employees. </p>\r\n<p>The most important learning aspect for the head of the works council is that reorganisation can be an emotional and difficult process. Employees can take a lot of the burden to heart. It is important to think more generally, because when you think too much about the individuals involved, the job of a works council member can be very tough. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Michel Winnubst, EIM </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources </h2>\r\n<p><b>Interview </b></p>\r\n<p>Peter Rutten (CEO) and Auke Faber (head of the works council), </p>\r\n<p>Vialle Alternative Fuel Systems B.V.</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website: </b> <a HREF=""http://www.vialle.nl"">www.vialle.nl</a></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Netherlands"~"29 - manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers"~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"internal restructuring"~"2011-09-06"
"Zet Transport, Poland"~"Zettransport Sp. z. oo"~"<p>Increased regulation after Poland joined the EU in 2004, plus growing competition, put pressure on Zet Transport, a transport and freight forwarding business. Its turnover was growing but profit was falling. Two periods of restructuring in 2006–2008 and 2010–2012 saw wide-ranging change,  including changing the legal form of the company, extending operations, partial relocation and setting up a subsidiary to service its fleet. The company gained in business and economic terms, although these benefits took some time to become clear.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Transport was established in March 1993 as a private\r\nfamily partnership of Józef, Jan and Józef (junior) Załubscy.\r\nJózef and Józef jr. are passive shareholders. Jan Załubski,\r\nthe company president and main shareholder, had the idea of starting up a\r\nbusiness in this form. He holds an MSc in engineering and graduated from\r\nKraków Technical University in 1994. Prior to founding Zet Transport, he\r\nhad some business experience, as during his studies he ran a small trading\r\ncompany called Bentax. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Zet Transport Sp. z o.o. is a family business specialising in transport services. It is a follow-up of a transport service run by Józef Załubski senior, who was involved in this type of business since 1983. In 1993, two sons, Jan and Józef jr., joined the company wishing to continue the family tradition. The company was originally based in Żbikowice, a village in Łososina Dolna municipality in the Malopolska region. From the start of its operations, the company focused on the development of international transport. Getting an inside knowledge of this trade, careful observation and understanding of economic trends, as well as applying modern technologies allowed the company to build a strong and modern enterprise and its status as a reliable business partner. In a short time, Zet Transport developed its operations with a new office in Nowy Sacz and a transport base for rented vehicles.</p>\r\n<p>From its start-up in 1993, Zet Transport has conducted the same type of activity – the transport of assets and goods, as well as freight forwarding. The company has branches, in the form of joint ventures, in Slovakia, Ukraine and Austria. The branches are autonomous; they have their own competences and scope of activities. They did not take part in the restructuring, but they complement the Zet Transport offer. The company’s staff mainly comprise drivers with a basic education who hold special licences (appropriate driving licence categories) that authorise them to drive trucks. The company is international due to the number of operations carried out in foreign markets, its clients and its suppliers. Only 20% of customers are local, while 30% are national and 50% are foreign (international). The company has a corporate social responsibility policy, which was developed in 2007 in the course of the restructuring process described in this case study. However, it does not have trade unions or employee representatives (employee council). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Since 2005, company turnover had been growing, while profit was declining. This was a result of a complete change of parameters (new legal regulations after accession to the EU) in the sector, which mainly came into effect following Poland’s accession to the EU and increased competition in the sector. That is why the implementation of the restructuring process was necessary. It also allowed the company to ensure the stability of its operations, protect its staff from dismissals and search for new strategies in the new market conditions. </p>\r\n<p>Obtaining outsourcing contracts from SGL Group (one of the world’s leading manufacturers of carbon-based products) was a key decision in the corporate development strategy.</p>\r\n<p>Changes occurred as a response to the changing business environment and increased competition in the market. Growing labour costs, on the one hand, and changing requirements for the transport sector and efficiency of its operations, on the other, forced the decision on amending the investment strategy in terms of obtaining vehicles. Decisions on implementing restructuring measures were usually made three to six months in advance by the owner and the board of management, including middle management. </p>\r\n<p>Adapting to the changing market parameters and openness to other options, such as a merger with another transport company, capital injection and so on were the main reasons for restructuring. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The company underwent two stages of restructuring in 2006–2008 and 2010–2012. The restructuring processes involved several measures. </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The legal form and status of the company was changed from\r\nprivate partnership to limited liability company\r\n(spółka z ograniczoną\r\nodpowiedzialnością or<b> </b> sp. z o.o. in\r\nPolish). The change of its legal form resulted from\r\nthe development strategy adopted. A one-person management was established. The\r\ncompany has no supervisory board or auditing committee. </li>\r\n<li>The decision to change the legal form was due to both\r\nplanned investment measures and the need to limit risk. The limited liability\r\ncompany is a universal economic structure, which depending on needs and the\r\nspecific strategy, may take different approaches to obtaining capital.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>The company’s operations were extended through the\r\ninsourcing of loading and unloading of trucks, and packaging and pallet making.\r\nThis implemented a management strategy that was modified following the\r\nrestructuring process, and which involved the generation of alternative revenues\r\nearned from activities associated or complementary to the main activities.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>A partial relocation was implemented through establishing\r\njoint ventures (search for a new location for the business due to the tax and\r\nlabour regulations) with local and well-known partners in Slovakia, Ukraine and\r\nAustria, to provide services for these markets, and to the east and south of\r\nEurope. The aim was to activate an operational structure in these specific\r\ncountries both to search for additional business through obtaining new customers\r\nas well as to provide a better standard of service to current\r\ncustomers.</li>\r\n<li>Servicing and sale of spare parts have been allocated to\r\nTruck Partner Sp. z o.o., a new subsidiary that has 11 employees and developed\r\non the basis of Zet Transport’s experience. It was established to service\r\nthe Zet Transport fleet. Previously, the company’s fleet was serviced by\r\nZet Transport to certain extent, or servicing was outsourced. Both companies are\r\nmanaged by Jan Załubski. At the initial stage of developing the fleet,\r\nhaving appropriate support services was of key importance as Zet Transport\r\npurchased imported second-hand vehicles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The final decision was made by the owner and company’s board of management. It was focused on implementation of a follow-up development strategy after the restructuring, which was based on the company’s own concept and implemented independently, excluding any capital injection, which had been initially considered.</p>\r\n<p>Restructuring measures commenced without any formal (that is, written) restructuring plan. However, they were all delivered based on an informally defined plan and assumed objectives. The timetable of specific measures was modified in accordance with changing market conditions.</p>\r\n<p>The company had to address economic situation and changing market and political conditions and correct the restructuring process as it proceeded. Examples of that approach include responding to the need of a key customer to receive the additional service of loading and unloading goods in this customer’s premises, and extending operations with making pallets and packaging . The decision on joint organisation of the Euro 2012 football championship by Poland and Ukraine was another key element – the company perceived this event as an opportunity to increase the volume of cargo and trade outside of EU territory. It was an additional argument for establishing a company in Ukraine. (These changes were part of restructuring process and were associated with insourcing and relocation.)</p>\r\n<p>The Truck Partner company was established to meet Zet Transport’s service needs and is located in the local market. It continually developed its operation and provides services to other transport companies in the region.</p>\r\n<p>Financial restructuring was delivered exclusively with the company’s own funds and through a modified form of leasing. New vehicles were financed through a new and ‘special’ structure for financing the leasing of vehicles developed by the company’s board of management and delivered by Millennium Leasing. This enabled the company to complete the financing of a given vehicle at any time (without the need to wait until the end of the financing period laid down in the contract). This helped to reduce technical costs generated by use of the vehicles under the warranty period.</p>\r\n<p>Employees were informed of planned changes and measures to be implemented during information meetings that took place prior to and during restructuring. In general, they demonstrated understanding and active participation (without strikes) in the restructuring process. The favourable approach of the employees towards the planned restructuring resulted from the fact that the company pursued an active information policy and encouraged acceptance of the restructuring strategy adopted. That allowed the company to maintain the same number of staff, upgrade working standards and improve the company’s position.   </p>\r\n<p>Each department implemented the restructuring measures allocated to it. The company’s organisational units implement the strategy according to the separation of corporate duties and responsibilities. The operational tasks of the freight forwarding department had to be optimised in terms of availability of vehicles, emphasising the maximum use of working time by the drivers, reducing the so-called empty kilometres and amending fuel policy. Those changes required that the former financial settlement process, information flow had to be modified, and workflow developed and implemented. The other departments of the enterprise were involved in drafting new guidelines, and, where necessary, staff underwent IT training in computer software and new solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main problems related to human resources, that is lack of knowledge and skills among the staff. New tasks required employees to change their way of working. Other problems concerned legislative changes and adaptation to EU requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Another element that caused modifications to the planned restructuring process was the lack of stability in the euro exchange rate, which in the Polish economy strongly affects both the price of fuels and the balance of the cargo mass intended for transport on the market. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>In the course of the restructuring process, the company sought IT support, access to know-how and training. It received EU-funded support under the Phare 2002 programme for the ‘purchase of hardware and software to modernise teleinformation network’. Cofinancing granted by the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development reached 50%, with the same level of match funding.</p>\r\n<p>In order to address changing market conditions and when starting the restructuring, the company made efforts to upgrade vocational qualifications of its staff through professional training. In this context, training cofinanced by EU funding was also used. In 2007, management took part in the Interpersonal Communication and Motivation course. In 2008, all staff of the freight forwarding department, the company’s operational department, were trained in selling techniques for the freight forwarding sector. In parallel, commercial transport-related training was made available in response to changes in areas such as new EU legislation, on an ongoing basis.</p>\r\n<p>The owner is of the opinion that obtaining funds is difficult due to the obligatory procedures. Many EU cofinanced projects also exclude participation of transport companies – or immediately reduce the scoring in an evaluation if an applicant operates in the transport sector. Funding provided under this type of assistance may not be spent on purchase of new vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of the restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Restructuring followed in accordance with the restructuring plan adopted. It accomplished the goals set both for the company and its employees. Maintaining the same number of staff and avoiding dismissals was one of the objectives successfully accomplished that were of importance to employees.</p>\r\n<p>The structure of management was also changed by changing the legal form of the company into a limited liability company. The strategy of actions and restructuring plans convinced the owner that it would be easier to restructure the company by changing its legal form. Moreover, as has already been explained, it provided a formal structure to facilitate any future capital solutions. </p>\r\n<p>The outcomes included the requalification and reorganisation of staff. Staff were trained in how to operate in the open EU market. The way drivers used their working time had to be reorganised, and this was facilitated by a specially developed, dedicated tool for carriers to help them to plan their work. It enabled online tracking of both the vehicle and driver’s available working time in order to select appropriate tasks, which contributed to increased efficiency in vehicle use. Working hours and time of the company’s staff remained unchanged.  </p>\r\n<p>Among various outcomes achieved, the introduction of an incentive scheme (bonuses) for operational staff is worth emphasising. Acquiring new skills and competences resulting from changes in work organisation is also of importance. In order to address challenges, the board decided upon providing the staff of the shipment department with Transics software tools to support the operational process. In this context, the shipment department staff and drivers had to undergo training to learn to use the equipment and change their structure of operations. The use of modern information technologies in planning and freight forwarding enhanced the quality of services. Transics software also facilitated exchange of information among employees.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring measures protected the staff from dismissals, and since 2006, the number of staff has been growing steadily. In 2006, it reached 125, with 89 drivers, 6 involved in loading and unloading  and 30 others. Currently (2012), the company employs 155 people where 103 are drivers, 16 are loading team staff and make pallets, and 36 work elsewhere in the business. </p>\r\n<p>Positive outcomes of the restructuring measures, economic ones in particular, were not immediately apparent. It was a long-term process that is easier to assess from a longer perspective. A small improvement in the company’s financial situation was observed in 2007, when a loss smaller than in 2006 was recorded. In the second stage of restructuring, which took place between 2010 and 2012, net income was significantly better. In 2011 the company recorded a profit, which facilitated capital investments including purchase of new trucks.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>In general, the outcomes of restructuring were beneficial as market potential was extended. Employees’   career prospects improved, due to the acquisition of new skills, opportunities for professional development and new responsibilities. In its strategic plans, the company expects to enter into new markets and to enhance its market offering, and in terms of its staff, opportunities for further upgrading of their qualifications and new skills acquisition through vocational training and courses. </p>\r\n<p>Listing key differences between restructuring of SMEs and large enterprises, the owner stressed that in small and medium-sized enterprises, the restructuring process is faster than in large enterprises. </p>\r\n<p>Disadvantages for SMEs include the lack of relevant knowledge, know-how and funds to finance restructuring processes, while advantages include less company ‘inertia’ and accelerated decision-making process and execution of the decisions. </p>\r\n<p>The recent experience of Zet Transport indicates that restructuring should be implemented more dynamically. Introducing restructuring changes faster would save time and resources. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Załubski thinks that the key issue that should be recommended in terms of public support for planning and implementing restructuring by businesses is greater tax flexibility for restructuring enterprises and introducing ‘friendly’ procedures and service from public authorities. ‘Careful observation of the business environment, monitoring market trends, benchmarking and anticipating changes on the market’ were further recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Kogut, an employee (35 years of age), shared her opinion\r\non Zet Transport restructuring. Ms Kogut has worked for Zet Transport for five\r\nand a-half years as the board’s representative responsible for the quality\r\nmanagement system. (Before joining Zet Transport, she worked in a school and in\r\nthe brewery industry.) She took part in the restructuring process,  and had\r\ndirect contact with the staff of the freight forwarding, finance, IT and human\r\nresources departments as well as with the company’s board. Ms Kogut\r\nbenefited from the process by gaining restructuring-related know-how and\r\nexperience. Her role in the restructuring process involved dissemination of\r\ninformation, training and overseeing introduced changes. In connection with the\r\nquality management system, she took part in amending the existing procedures or\r\ndeveloping new ones. Drafts were developed in cooperation with representatives\r\nof the specific departments. Presenting new solutions and training in the field\r\nof new methodology of operations was another stage. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Ms Kogut thinks that due to the restructuring, the company gained benefits through insourcing of loading and unloading of goods and making pallets and packaging, which allowed it to keep its current customers. Similar benefits were gained as a result of the partial relocation to Slovakia, Ukraine and Austria. Implementation of the Transics IT system was another benefit. The system reorganised work of the company’s staff and additionally prepared the operational structure for additional vehicles, without the need of employing extra administrative staff.</p>\r\n<p>Employees were not involved in the decision on implementing restructuring. However, they were informed and familiarised with the restructuring projects planned. They were able to present their conclusions, comments and even doubts, which were considered by the management. That process took the form of consultations with the staff concerning operational potential in terms of implementation of restructuring plan. It was attempted to identify tools necessary to accomplish that objective – for example, access to data via remote desktop (in case of Zet Transport Ukraine or Zet Transport Slovakia), or a single programme to manage repairs in case of Truck Partner.  </p>\r\n<p>There were no staff dismissals or reductions. Employees received support to requalify in the form of training and courses. As a result of information meetings organised by the management, the employees started to understand the process and actively supported implementation of the changes. The company employed staff responsible for preparing and training new employees from the branches in Slovakia and Ukraine. Their stay in the company’s base in Nowy Sacz provided an opportunity to get familiar with the procedures and general operational rules enforced in the transport and freight forwarding company. The IT department received the task of developing a platform for sharing information about loads and vacant vehicles, which gave a competitive advantage of the company.  </p>\r\n<p>Mutual cooperation was also translated into other areas of the company’s operations, such as recruitment of drivers from Ukraine. Opening of European markets resulted in the migration of Polish drivers to the EU states, thus drivers from the east became an alternative. In this context, the HR department staff had to learn procedures of recruiting staff from non-EU states.  </p>\r\n<p>Staff showed creativity and entrepreneurial behaviours. They acquired new skills and competences. Rapid development of the company between 2004 and 2008 resulted in a problem of recruiting drivers holding required vocational qualifications. The changes were implemented in an optimum manner, during the process of planning and implementation. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gancarczyk, Jagiellonian University, Krakow,\r\nPoland</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Załubski, President and main shareholder</li>\r\n<li>Kogut, Quality Manager</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Zet Transport Sp. z o.o.

"Acropolis Dry Cleaners, Cyprus "~"Acropolis Dry Cleaners"~"<p>Founded in 1975, the family-run Acropolis Dry Cleaners is a market leader in the dry-cleaning sector in Cyprus. It comprises six micro-businesses, having expanded its operations and services over the years. Expansion however has been hampered by poor trade and pressure to cut costs. Striving for operational efficiency in the crisis, to cut costs the business had to close a retail unit and outsource services, as well as integrate a hybrid franchised workshop store into its network of retail shops. Yet the business has managed to retain 25 employees since 2007.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Eracleous &amp; Sons Ltd, trading as Acropolis Dry Cleaners, is one of the market leaders in the fragmented dry-cleaning sector, offering the highest standards of service, due to continuous investment in modern technologies. Today, the company employs 25 people (including owner/managers) and enjoys sustainable business success, steady growth and financial stability. It constitutes a group of micro-businesses that are integrated into Acropolis, which is the ‘parent firm’ and is wholly owned by the family owner/managers. The organisational structure of this small enterprise is very flat, managerial positions are held by family members and there is no works council.  </p>\r\n<p>Acropolis Dry Cleaners was founded in Larnaca in 1975 by the – now semi-retired – owner Zacharias Eracleous when he was aged 28 years, following a long apprenticeship (16 years) in the industry. In the early days, the original firm was a sole proprietorship, run by the founder, offering dry cleaning from a one-stop workshop and retail unit (often referred to as a store in the industry). Zacharias Eracleous established a loyal clientele in the town, but also used to organise the collection of clothing from nearby villages, notably Aradhippou, where the family is based. Following early growth, the firm progressed to the profitable stage of the business life cycle model, with no formal strategic plan to expand further. The emphasis has been on offering quality service to its loyal customer base. The store was profitable enough for the founder to buy out the freehold of the property and to be able to support the growing family of five sons. Family developments have proved the trigger for business growth in order to provide the expanding family with jobs.</p>\r\n<p>Thirty-six years after its establishment, Acropolis Dry Cleaners opened its second store in 2002, after buying another company in nearby Livadhia village, with a view to scaling up operations via horizontal integration. In 2004 and every year until 2008, they embarked on an ambitious expansion through horizontal integration by opening up stores in new locations in the suburban village towns of Aradippou, Kiti, Nissou and Anglisides around Larnaca town. The range of services has been expanded and now includes laundry cleaning and ironing, leather and carpet dry-cleaning, fabric repairs, curtain cleaning, specialist cleaning and pressing of wedding dresses and tuxedos. </p>\r\n<p>In recent years, the firm has triggered new business activities such as laundrettes, which also act as points-of-sale for the dry-cleaning operation, and a rental service offering table and chair covers. Acropolis Ltd evolved from one small retail workshop into a fully integrated owner-managed family business that dominates the dry-cleaning market in the Larnaca district. Following incremental growth, the firm today enjoys a leading market position, with a network of shops that are vertically integrated with a state-of-the art central production plant for the cleaning operations.</p>\r\n<p>Following its business expansion, Acropolis Dry Cleaners went through a series of restructurings and reorganisations, as part of a multi-dimensional strategic plan, addressing managerial, ownership and financial issues. </p>\r\n<p>In the context of the prolonged macro-economic-financial crisis, two major restructuring events are the focus of this case study. In its search for operational efficiency and sustainable competitiveness, Acropolis decided to close a retail unit operating on the high street and outsource the service to a local supermarket. The company also abandoned a hybrid franchising route by wholly acquiring a retail unit that involved a partnership with the managing director, and they have integrated the business unit into their network of shops that outsource the dry-cleaning to a central depot located in the industrial estate. </p>\r\n<p>Today, the firm does not suffer from a funding gap – a shortage of bank loans coupled with escalating late payment of trade debtors – that often hinders growth and jeopardises the survival of smaller firms. During recent tough times, the Eracleous have ‘shaken the tree’ and got rid of some business clients (such as hoteliers that fail to honour their terms of engagement by delaying settlement of their invoices). Today, Acropolis Dry Cleaners remains focused on developing high value added services to their loyal customers, as emphasised by their slogan: <i>Αlways offering clear solutions ! Πάντα , Καθaρές Δουλειές</i><i>! </i></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>In 2006, as a result of market development through the establishment of a network of workshops (retail units), the company embarked on an ambitious investment in a central production plant in Larnaca’s industrial estate to serve all of their shops. This was geared to standardise certain processes to achieve operational efficiency, reduce cost structures and ensure quality of service across the chain. </p>\r\n<p>This investment has been critical in the effective adoption of operations management systems across the integrated platform which allowed the building of sophisticated logistics (collection and delivery to the shops) and production systems employing state-of-the-art, ecologically friendly technologies and solutions. Through the standardisation of production and service across the network, training of staff and adoption of modern shop management techniques, the firm has achieved unparalleled success, offering high value added services to a growing customer base. However, the production plant has not managed to reach operational efficiency due to under-utilisation. Thus the firm is under pressure to expand and bring in greater volumes of apparel for cleaning.   </p>\r\n<p>In recent years, and in the context of the prolonged economic crisis, the owner/managers have pursued a restructuring process that primarily involved the closure of a retail store and outsourcing the service to a supermarket (cost-cutting), and the integration of a hybrid franchised workshop store into the network of retail shops (cost cutting and enhanced independence).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Given the predominance of Acropolis Dry Cleaners in Larnaca, the firm decided there was scope to expand geographically with partnering. It was imperative to grow in order to bring in more work for the central production plant seeking enhanced utilisation, but also to fence off any rivals entering the market. The owner/managers of the firm crafted the restructuring on an ad hoc basis, a step-by-step growth plan, which from time to time they discussed with their bankers and accountants. </p>\r\n<p>In 2008, the Eracleous set up an independent shop in Anglisides village, on the road to Limassol – a thriving metropolitan business centre. Basically, they took on a shop with a flexible lease to act as point-of-sale offering Acropolis services. In 2009, they established a limited company jointly (with a long-time associate who had also formerly been an employee) to acquire an existing dry-cleaning workshop venture in Nissou which is on the road to Nicosia – the capital city of Cyprus. Both shops have been equipped with their logistics systems and refurbished with their classic well branded model of operations. Given the small distance, experienced employees from the existing Acropolis operations were transferred to the new shops and then using word-of-mouth and networking they recruited additional staff, initially on a part-time basis and then, based on performance, on a full-time basis. </p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, their appetite for expansion has been hampered by poor trade and pressure to cut costs in order to cope with the recession. Thus the restructuring events as described below have been pursued.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Outsourcing </h3>\r\n<p>In the light of performance management, the Acropolis team decided to close the retail store (collection point, outsourcing the jobs to the central production plant) located on the high street in Anglisides village and relocate the service into a supermarket. Basically, this involved the closure of the store (capitalising on cost economies in terms of rentals, and saving on labour costs due to shedding a full-time job and a pro rata, part-time job). This action is effectively outsourcing, as the supermarket hosting the Acropolis service provides the counter for the collection and deliver of the treated apparel. Acropolis rewards the supermarket with a commission on the trade volume. This win-win partnering is proving fruitful for both parties. This model is under review in order for Acropolis to activate more collection points in other supermarkets in other locations. </p>\r\n<p>The Anglisides project, which took over a year to plan and implement, had to be re-engineered. Despite the fact that it has not violated their patient investment pay-back period, and there was optimism that through effective marketing the financial numbers would have picked up, after a year of running it the family decided to close the shop and simply outsource the operation as ‘a counter service’ in the leading supermarket in the village. The supermarket that hosts their service is adding value to their range of services, plus they get their commission from the Acropolis Cleaners. The new arrangements meant a lower cost structure because of savings on the rental payments, and a greater flow of people. The economic crisis has signalled a more conservative approach to growth. </p>\r\n<p>Thus, based on this business model innovation strategy, Acropolis Dry Cleaners now operates a partnership with the supermarket, considerably reducing its cost structure and offering its services to a higher flow of clients that are out shopping for essentials around the clock. As a result of this retrenchment, Acropolis continues to operate in the Anglisides area with a representative agent – who is rewarded by a commission on trade. Thus, Acropolis enjoys savings after exiting from the shop, saving on overheads and eliminating staff costs.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Acquisition of a sister firm </h3>\r\n<p>Acropolis acquired a sister firm by owning/managing a retail unit located in Nissou. Basically this store, which was owned by Acropolis and the managing director of the operation, was a type of hybrid franchising which was being investigated in order to expand further by establishing more units (based on partnership between Acropolis and the appointed managing directors). Unfortunately the economics of this workshop store (where production-dry cleaning was taking place on premises of the retail unit) were not very efficient. Thus this  restructuring is part of the strategic effort to consolidate the firm’s business model (and, for the owning family, to simplify the ownership and governance regime and consolidate control) in order to achieve cost savings essential to help reconfigure its business model to weather the crisis. </p>\r\n<p>The Nissou project, which involved geographic expansion with external growth strategies – the initial informal plan was to build a partnership via a franchising agreement with a few entrepreneurs in the region – also had to be revisited. More specifically, the Eracleous decided to buy out their Nissou partner with cash simply in order to save on management overheads and enhance their strategic independence to integrate the store into the network and make the operation more profitable. Again, in the context of the recession, the firm streamlined the Nissou workshop-store and fully integrated it as a point of sale store (collection and delivery of apparel) into their Larnaca network of shops, allowing the central production plant to do the cleaning.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Acropolis exemplifies the prolific small family business where the founding and/or successive generations of owners/managers play a protagonistic role in strategically navigating the family business across its development path. The Eracleous family have established a reputation as masters of the dry-cleaning trade. Acropolis Dry Cleaners is now synonymous with innovation and high value-added service. They have developed a cash-rich business model, enabling the Eracleous family to manage the classic challenge facing growing smaller firms: getting funding.  </p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the entrepreneurial family have managed to accommodate the aspirations of the new generation, kick-starting ventures to allow siblings to carry out entrepreneurial activities under the umbrella of the Acropolis confederation. As the siblings expand their own family units, it is envisaged that in the context of parallel strategic ‘family in business’ planning, each business unit will be matched to a family unit. Thus, the Eracleous have to master the challenge of building inter-generational goal congruence as the members of the second generation are taking more managerial positions in the firm and naturally want to impact on the decision-making process that governs venturing, growth and financing.</p>\r\n<p>As a result of the expansion of the network of workshop-stores as part of the integrated business network, the owner/managers have to cope with transitions and challenges overshadowing their evolving family and business organisation. More specifically, on the business axis, the firm has made a lot of progress and the quest for new growth horizons continues. They are mapping new ventures in order to fuel growth as the family has been growing faster than the business. </p>\r\n<p>On the family axis, the second generation (five sons) are working together with the founder who is acting as the executive chairman of the firm. Currently, there is inter-generational (father and sons) cooperation and intra-generational goal alignment – sons are working harmoniously to build business consolidation in the competitive market. The question is when/how will the next generation take over? How do they plan for the introduction of the third generation of family members?</p>\r\n<p>On the ownership axis, the father is still the controlling owner as he has the majority of the shareholding. Strategic succession planning is needed in order to ensure the smooth transfer of ownership rights, stewardship roles and responsibilities to the next generation. Currently they are all involved, working in the business, and there is a memorandum of understanding that shareholding will be distributed on <i>equal terms</i>. But already a son is exiting from the family business in order to pursue his own venture. This means that there is an emerging challenge concerning the ownership related succession, which is how to reorganise the shareholding on a more equitable terms, rather than an equal split of shares.  </p>\r\n<p>The managing director, Andreas Z. Eracleous, has been working tirelessly to develop a more effective organisation and governance structure, management and operations systems in order to master the company’s growing empire of small business units. Integrated into Acropolis are shops, laundrettes, a trading firm selling technology and chemical solutions (this helped them collect market intelligence), and another trading firm hiring linen such as table and chair covers to function halls, small hoteliers, etc. </p>\r\n<p>One of the challenges facing the Acropolis owner-management team is to safeguard goal alignment of the five brothers that represent the siblings’ partnership regime. They do not always agree on strategic goals and approaches, as they do not have a homogeneous entrepreneurial DNA. Occasionally, family issues do overshadow business management best practice, thus causing inertia, erosion of professionalisation and confused communication and blurred lines of command. Already one brother is seeking more entrepreneurial independence. </p>\r\n<p>There is growing pressure to re-evaluate the current business structure with a view to set up a holding group which can offer scope for better governance, better access to growth capital from the banks and make succession planning more systematic. Moreover, the new group structure allows members of the owning family to pursue their own ventures, in which the parent company can act as investor. This is why the family decided to buy out the Nissou partner in order to exercise full ownership control and thus embark on the new holding regime – which will involve the transfer of shares from operating companies to the new parent holding company. </p>\r\n<p>An emerging challenge is the banking crisis in Cyprus which resulted in reduced bank liquidity and subsequently credit rationing. Banks are seeking to renegotiate lending to SMEs using stringent collateral conditions. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The Eracleous family as artisan entrepreneurs have managed to master growth challenges, but now they are revisiting their strategic plan in order to survive in this ongoing recession. They have been learning from their mistakes, and somehow engineered entrepreneurial strategies with limited outside advisory support. Normally, they discuss strategic matters around the Sunday lunch table. The weekly management meeting is on Tuesday afternoon and the agenda mainly concerns operational matters. </p>\r\n<p>This forum was open to the non-family managers – when they were around in the jointly owned trading firm before the family decided to exit (to concentrate on their core business) and in the Nissou partnership venture which the family now wholly owns. Andreas Eracleous, as the CEO, often attends executive development seminars geared for smaller companies and tends to invite trainers/consultants to the family business meetings. This has helped the Eracleous to develop a consensus on the need to explore the strategic ‘family in business’ planning process which has to address multiple important business matters (such as leadership, management, taxation, funding, risk diversification) but also sensitive family issues such as succession which involves ownership and employment rights (governed by equality or meritocratic / equitable principles). </p>\r\n<p>With the support of their accountants-auditors and bankers, who act as the main source of advice, the Eracleous continue to strategically manage their integrated business model. They consult business advisors on an ad hoc basis on certain marketing tactics and strategic steps that focus on how to streamline operations in order to further improve the efficiency of the core business. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>In a nutshell, as a result of the restructuring process Acropolis has managed to keep its leading market positioning and level of employment to 25 people since 2007. Due to the restructuring, their network now has six stores. Jobs were lost in three stores, but three jobs were generated in the labour-intensive production plant. Normally, affected employees get an option to be relocated in other operations, in order to ease the impact of the restructuring. The company is proud that they have managed to sustain employment for their loyal employees. </p>\r\n<p>The outcome of the two restructuring events has impacted favourably on the bottom line, by saving on labour costs. Three employment posts have been cancelled: one full-time and one pro-rata, part-time sales assistant positions in Anglisides and one more supervisory post at Nissou workshop store. In addition to substantial labour cost savings, Acropolis have managed to enhance operational efficiency for the central production plant. </p>\r\n<p>In the words of the owner/managers ‘restructuring has been very positive as it has led to sustainable business success, stable sales performance and profitability’. In the short term, the restructuring events have resulted in the loss of jobs, but this is part of flexible entrepreneurial management, which can now allow the firm to embark on a coherent strategic plan to expand steadily.</p>\r\n<p>Next on the horizon, according to the CEO Andreas Eracleous (the eldest son of the founder) is further restructuring in the quest for efficiency. This involves the relocation of other retail shops to better positions and mapping out step-by-step growth via geographic expansion. Historically, the financing philosophy of the family owner/managers has been faithful to financial prudence and adherence to the pecking order principles of funding: retaining profits and securing short-term bank finance. Given the financial discipline of the owner/managers – as reflected in the systematic retention of profits – and in conjunction with the cash basis financial model of the business, the firm is weathering the current crisis and continues to enjoy an optimal capital base and sustainable bankability.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>It is axiomatic that the restructuring of Acropolis pursued by the Eracleous family, both in the context of internal and external growth, was initially driven by market opportunity; but with the crisis hitting Cyprus, they had to fend off market pressure in order to safeguard sustainability and financial stability. </p>\r\n<p>The owning family took the strategic decision not to simply grow the numbers, but to reconfigure operations with a view to getting better operational performance and profits which are imperative for long-term survival and step-by-step growth. Moreover, the brothers in business decided to exit from the company trading related to dry-cleaning technology and chemical solutions and to concentrate their efforts in the core business and fledgling ventures that enjoy a competitive advantage.  </p>\r\n<p>As Andreas Eracleous stated: ‘Growth has been healthy for us to identify our ‘fortes’; we are now keen to unfold growth opportunities for our family managers and other loyal staff to develop, by building on our successful business model; after consolidation, we envisage to generate “managerial partnerships<i>”</i>.’ In a nutshell, the company has mapped out their next growth horizon which will embrace next-generation family managers (and other loyal non-family insiders) who will be supported to set up new operating units in the metropolitan centres that can be served by the central Larnaka production plant. </p>\r\n<p>It is envisaged that the younger brothers will be incentivised to set up their own ventures in order to ‘franchise’ the Acropolis concept across the Larnaka region. This family confederation is necessary to test out the partnership formula which is based on the new retail units outsourcing the dry-cleaning of the apparel to the central production.</p>\r\n<p>In the context of strategic succession planning, the brothers, as a result of their renewed family independence, are now exploring how they can build integrated ‘family-in-business’ strategies balancing personal, familial and business goals. They aspire to match a business unit to each family unit, so that each brother can control one venture each. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Panikkos Poutziouris, UCLan Cyprus </p>\r\n<p>Elias Hadjielias, UCLan Cyprus </p>\r\n<p>Milena Marinova, Zateons Associates, Business Advisors </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Andreas Eracleous (CEO) and Lenos Eracleous (Production Manager), Eracleous and Sons </p>\r\n<p>Michalis Eracleous, family employee and entrepreneur</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.acropoliscleaners.com"">www.acropoliscleaners.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Cyprus"~"96 - other personal service activities"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"merger / acquisition*outsourcing*relocation"~"2012-01-10"
"ADV, Romania"~"ADV"~"<p>The downturn in 2009 meant that Romanian advertising production company ADV had to take on smaller contracts. Cost-cutting measures included not replacing temporary workers or those resigning, re-negotiating contract terms with suppliers, moving two departments to one single space, freezing wages, cutting senior staff salaries and not paying bonuses. ADV returned to profitability in 2010 and one year later the company moved to a new location, raised salaries and increased staff by 5%.</p>"~"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>ADV is an advertising production company. The company was started in 2000 by &lsquo;Mr T&rsquo;, who at the time was working as a cameraman for a Romanian TV channel. Mr T is the general manager of ADV advertising. The company employs 50 people and does not have a works council. In 2010, Mr T offered shares as an incentive to five of his senior staff. One person was promoted to the position of partner and given a separate line of business to run (Public Relations).</p>\r\n<p>Although Mr T did not consult anyone in this decision, he says that from own experience he felt that some people would react better to shares than to a salary raise. He says that he did not have any prior expectations but felt it was the only option at the time to motivate the staff. One deliberate decision he made was to choose people who had stuck with him over time, although others would have qualified also.</p>\r\n<p>Mr T had studied theology and film. He attended the EMBA Berlin School of Creative Leadership. He toyed with entrepreneurship since he was in school and while he was a student at the Buzau Theological Seminary he got to know the world of television, when he collaborated with a local station and also with the national TV station TVR on the Spiritual Life programme. He left in 2000 to establish ADV.</p>\r\n<p>In Romania, the name of Mr T and ADV are linked to successful campaigns for brands like Timisoreana, Alexandrion, Bucovina, Apa Nova, Boom, Cosmote, Monte Banato, Omo and Millennium Bank.</p>\r\n<p>Mr T coordinated a successful communication campaign in over 10 election campaigns, five for the current Romanian President.</p>\r\n<p>In recent years, ADV has crystallised its mission: &lsquo;We help brands to help people.&rsquo; Thus, people are the centre of most brand communication and most of the brands ADV deals with focus on values.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>ADV is 100% focused on clients that have their activity in Romania and thus target Romanian customers. In 2009, due to the deterioration of the economic conditions, the majority of firms in Romania cut their advertising budgets. Naturally, this affected most of ADV Advertising SR&rsquo;s clients. The advertising budgets were the first ones to be cut for the majority of companies in Romania. The only examples where budgets have remained similar to previous levels were a few multinationals in telecommunications and gasoline distribution, according to &lsquo;Ms I&rsquo;. But even in those cases the duration of the economic crisis has forced even those companies to cut their advertising budget in 2011.</p>\r\n<p>This meant in the first stage that for 2009 and 2010 the company had to accept smaller contracts and some clients gave up new advertising altogether. For 2009 Mr T was able to keep his entire staff and to pay them their salaries. In fact he hoped until the end of the year that the situation would turn around. But at the end of 2009 Mr T was facing a new year with fewer clients and much smaller advertising budgets. Thus at the end of 2009 he had to take some tough decisions.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>At the end of 2009, Mr T and his senior staff had to find ways to reduce costs. As in the case of other SMEs, the financial crisis took Mr T by surprise. Also, this was the first time he and his colleagues were facing a financial crisis as managers. They did not have a plan at first, they just had to cover &lsquo;holes&rsquo; as they appeared. Action needed to be taken as the turnover had been falling constantly throughout the year and the prospects for 2010 were not encouraging.</p>\r\n<p>Some decisions were more obvious than others and implied less management involvement, and thus were easier to take. As Mr T said, he had no formal management training and thus he tried to find decisions that were easy to take from this perspective but also fast to implement and with less trauma for the employees. For example, employees who resigned or were hired on temporary contracts were not replaced. The main costs besides salaries were identified as cost for supplies, rent and utilities. Mr T and his senior staff hoped that by looking at these costs first the economy will turn around and would not have to adjust any costs related to the personnel.</p>\r\n<p>Also, some suppliers agreed to re-negotiate the contract terms even though it was before the official negotiating date stipulated in the contract. These negotiations between the management of ADV and its suppliers did not have direct implications for the employed staff. However, as the company as a whole saved money and improved the cash flow the implications for the staff were long term as they kept their jobs. Among the suppliers that agreed to renegotiate were the phone provider, the internet provider and the office equipment provider. But further adjustments were needed. Until 2009 the PR and the Advertising side were renting two different spaces. In 2010 Mr T took the decision to move both of them in one single space, which was much cheaper. As the two business lines are connected, the new setup suited everyone. One added feature that was mentioned by Mr T and a favorite of the staff was that in the new location almost everyone had a parking space (parking is a serious problem in Bucharest).</p>\r\n<p>Mr T said that getting the suppliers to adjust their prices before the negotiating date stipulated in the contract was easier than he expected. On the one hand he had to deal with the same issue on his side as his clients demanded the same attitude from him. Thus, he used his own situation of being forced to cut revenues to bring his suppliers to the negotiation table. The contracts were rewritten to include the new prices for supplies and services. There are two main points here: the date of the contracts was extended and in some cases the quantities of the supplies were increased in the later years of the contract. Of course, the only costs that could not be reduced were those with the utilities and that was one of the main reasons for relocation. In this way the utilities bill was reduced and as mentioned before there were improved results from the business lines synergies.</p>\r\n<p>As the recession dragged on new decisions to cut costs were needed. These decisions were harder to take and, most importantly, more difficult to convey to the staff. The least painful was to freeze salaries for six months at first and then for another six months. At the same time senior staff&rsquo;s salaries were cut by 25% for six months. Also, no bonuses were paid for 2009 and 2010. Understandably, the reaction of employees to the salary freeze was at first bad. They all argued that their own bills have gone up and counted on higher wages. Unfortunately they did not have the same negotiating power to reduce their own costs as a big company has. However, Mr T and Ms I had meetings with all employees, explaining the financial situation of the company, the costs that were already cut and their view of the future of the company. They also presented scenarios with salaries increasing as before and salaries frozen (or cut as it was the case for senior staff). The staff attitude towards the salary freeze improved once all the information was presented to them. The alternative could have been that they all would have lost their jobs if they insisted on salary rises as in the boom years.</p>\r\n<p>Mr T completed the move to the new location in 2011. He also decided to share the space in the new location with another company, an internet developer who had worked with them before, to share the costs. The nature of Mr. T&rsquo;s business is that it relies quite heavily on internet development. Both business lines, advertising and PR, have been relying more and more in recent years on internet development. Therefore, besides the costs argument there was also the business interest to bring in the same location the internet provider company that it is being used for 90% of the ADV&rsquo;s projects.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>As the restructuring process involved cutting and freezing wages, there was a risk that some of the senior and professional staff would leave. Also, there was a risk that the quality of work would suffer. Thus Mr T had to get involved in the day-to-day business of the agency more than ever before to demonstrate to the staff that the measures were temporary and necessary. For example, any expense &ndash; lunch with a client or a pitch &ndash; had to be approved personally by him. He would participate at meetings with the most sensitive clients or senior staff. The purpose was twofold: to motivate his own staff but to make sure that he kept a personal relationship with clients in case one of his senior people would be offered an opportunity by a client or a competitor. He attended internal meetings with junior staff as well as senior staff. The staff were positive about this experience and took every opportunity to ask about the welfare of the company, about new projects, about the future direction or about how to respond to different moves made by the competition. Mr T said that he expected his staff to enjoy his visits and interest in the details of the projects but he did not expect it to be &lsquo;this much fun&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The other problem still faced by the agency was the still tough market conditions in a bad economic environment. In this environment Mr T was trying to acquire new clients to increase his business&rsquo; profitability. The challenge faced by Mr T was an obvious one and it is faced by all companies during economic crises: lower revenues due to lower budgets from clients (some going bankrupt) while costs were harder to cut. In this environment, after cutting costs as much as possible the only way to increase profitability was to acquire new clients (if he wanted to stay in business and not wither away). On top of everything his agency lost one of the most important clients to a competitor. Also, the next election year was 2012 and thus no short-term political project was in sight.</p>\r\n<p>In the end he managed to bring in new clients, including a beer company who has been one of the more consistent accounts.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Mr T did not use outside advice or support throughout the restructuring process. He said that there were two reasons for this: he knows his company best and in Romania restructuring consultants are expensive and tend to specialise in big companies and financial institutions.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Mr T had to implement some tough measures to keep his business alive. The crisis has hit the Romanian advertising market harder than anyone would have expected. Mr T knew that the measures were necessary to keep the company profitable. It was hard to get his staff on board but in the end he managed.</p>\r\n<p>As a result ADV was able to return to profitability in 2010. It kept its key people and is now again winning new clients. It is important to note that the company remained profitable while the rest of the industry is still in the red.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, the company moved to a new location, managed to increase salaries and to increase staff by 5%. The staff increase was related to a new account that the PR business line acquired at the beginning of 2011. Some of the staff hired for this project only had temporary work contracts. All of this was done even though 2012 was another a challenging year.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Without any outside help, Mr T has managed to survive and even improve the condition of his company during the ongoing economic crisis, based on a programme of cost-cutting that included a salary freeze. He claims it shows that he knows his business best, but most importantly that he knows his people.</p>\r\n<p>The main lessons here are: in times of crisis make sure you keep your staff informed and motivated. Also, it helps if top management gets involved in the day-to-day work of the different projects as the staff feel empowered by this attitude.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Florin Cite, SC GEA Strategy and Consulting SRL</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr T, Owner and Manager, ADV</p>\r\n<p>Ms I, PR Partner</p>"~"Romania"~"73 - advertising and market research"~"50-249"~"10-49"~NULL~"internal restructuring*relocation"~"2011-10-13"
"Aktis, Greece"~"Aktis S.A."~"<p>Employees of the Greek firm Aktis have been strongly involved in the process of setting up a joint venture with a Romanian partner. As their expertise was a crucial asset while the new production unit was set up in Romania, three or four employees had to move there in order to monitor the process and train their Romanian colleagues.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Aktis S.A. is a company that has been in the construction industry for more than 20 years. Its main operations involve the development and application of new technologies in the field of road construction and maintenance, both in Greece and in the Balkans. The company’s headquarters are located in Thessaloniki (northern Greece), while its production unit is in Romania. Another branch (administrative offices) of Aktis S.A. is also located in Romania, in the capital city Bucharest, in order to enable better monitoring of the local market (construction projects). The company operates a subsidiary firm in Bulgaria, with Aktis engaged in projects there since 1992, hence exhibiting a strong orientation to international activities during the last 20 years.</p>\r\n<p>Since its foundation, the company has continuously diversified its activities, based on a commitment to invest in research and technological development and in quality assurance systems. Aktis has established effective cooperation with universities and research centres in Greece, which have driven the expansion of its scope so as to include the following activities/fields:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Maintenance and improvement of road\r\npavement </li>\r\n<li>Traffic management and Intelligent Traffic Solutions\r\n(ITS) </li>\r\n<li>Routine Maintenance Management System (RMMS) using\r\ndigital video </li>\r\n<li>Ground Radar Applications for non-destructive\r\ndetermination of the various layers of thickness of the pavement or rail base.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The company’s history dates back to 1975 when the company Vitoumina S.A. was founded by Aktis’ current managing director’s father and partners. Vitoumina was initially engaged in asphalt, chemical and oil products processing and trading. In 1984, the owners decided to develop the technical department, and Aktis was founded as a subsidiary. The primary aim was to operate in the construction industry, particularly road construction, by utilising a core product that the parent firm was producing: a specialised emulsion. Since then, Aktis has focused on an  innovative technique for road construction and maintenance – ‘slurry-sealing’ or ‘micro-surfacing’ –becoming the only company in Greece capable of performing this technique (now widespread in several European countries including Germany, France and Spain). This competitive advantage enabled the company to participate in numerous public construction projects in Greece (for example, ‘Macedonia’ airport’s runway maintenance in 2010 and the construction of slurry seal micro-surfacing on the Alexandroupoli–Kipoi section of the Egnatia Odos motorway) and in the Balkan region (for example, the maintenance of the national road network of Romania during the last 25 years).</p>\r\n<p>In 1991 the founder of the company decided to sell his shares in Vitoumina but retained ownership (together with four other owners) and the position of General Manager in Aktis, which continued to operate autonomously, even though it still constituted one of Vitoumina’s main clients until 2007–8. In the meantime, his son entered the business and replaced him (as the new General Manager) in 2006, while the founder still holds a position in the company’s managing board, together with the four other owners. His son holds a PhD in economics in the field of economics of innovation and knowledge and worked in Brussels from 1998 to 2003 in the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Science, Research and Development, before returning to Greece as Managing Director of Aktis S.A.</p>\r\n<p>The company has shown stable growth over the last 20 years, with annual turnover during the last five years of €3 million. Almost 30 people are employed in Greece, with up to 50 when projects require it, especially during the summer period. However, this number was recently reduced significantly, as company performance was severely affected by the ongoing economic recession in Greece. There is no collective employee representation; the majority of employees are highly specialised and well-experienced engineers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>Aktis S.A’s innovative technique for road construction and maintenance is based on the utilisation of a specialised emulsion that constitutes the major raw material. This emulsion was exclusively produced by Vitoumina S.A. until 2007. Since then, however, Vitoumina experienced poor financial performance and extended debts, and discontinued its operations after 2009. The current manager of Aktis was aware of this situation by 2004–5 and started worrying about the main supplier’s ability to produce this emulsion. Aktis examined alternative solutions to overcome this barrier – which could constitute an extremely significant problem in the near future, since more than 1,000 tonnes were needed on an annual basis. At the same time, the company had acquired the knowledge and the skills required to produce this emulsion. </p>\r\n<p>During 2008, the company undertook the completion of large-scale construction projects in Romania, where the particular technique of ‘micro-surfacing’ is also known and used, after tendering the lowest bid. The company’s collaborators in Romania had also informed the manager of Aktis that several other projects were to be put out to tender, as there were some ongoing discussions and preparations regarding the public assignment of construction projects to the lowest tenders. </p>\r\n<p>It was then obvious that Aktis should fully ensure access to the specialised emulsion if it was to participate in these tenders, given that the company’s intention was to expand further in the Balkan region. The performance of the main supplier was a major barrier and, thus, the managing board decided that the best solution was to expand production of the emulsion through a vertical integration strategy. This decision was taken in 2008 during a meeting of the managing board, in which alternative options were discussed. The company acquired the specialised mechanical equipment needed to produce the emulsion. There remained the problem of where to install it. </p>\r\n<p>Alternatives were assessed, as the managing board initially decided to install the equipment on land the company owns in the neighbouring Thessaloniki area (35 km from Aktis’ headquarters). However, previous participation in numerous projects in Romania has shown that transportation costs could significantly raise total costs and in this case transportation of the emulsion to Romania would represent an additional cost of 75%, which the company could not bear. Given the emerging opportunities in Romania, as well as the extensive experience gained through participation in several projects there, it was decided that installing the production unit there would constitute the most suitable solution, since the business environment in Greece was deteriorating and prospects were less encouraging compared with Romania. Thus, the company presents an example of a combination of restructuring events, namely internal restructuring (that is insourcing and vertical integration), as well as business expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring decision was taken in 2008, and it was further advanced after Aktis made the lowest bid for another construction project in Romania in April 2009. As soon as the owners realised the extremely positive prospects in the Romanian market and calculated the costs of the emulsion’s transportation there, the managing board decided to install the recently acquired equipment, which was a transportable production unit, close to Bucharest, where Aktis had located a type of office premises in early 2009.</p>\r\n<p>The plan was to set up the production unit there in the next four months (April–July 2009), since the company had to complete a project in August 2009. The managing board decided that the production unit should be fully operational by that time, in order to enable the company to fully take advantage of it for this specific project and avoid additional (transportation) costs. Then the managing board decided that it was in the company’s interests to establish this production unit as a ‘separate’ company and different options were assessed. </p>\r\n<p>The company soon reached an agreement with a Romanian partner, long engaged in subcontracting assignments and familiar to the managing director and his father since the early years of Aktis’ operations in this market. Thus, a type of ‘consortium’ or ‘joint venture’ was founded, in which Aktis and the Romanian partner contributed 50%. Aktis’ know-how, as well as the recently acquired mechanical equipment, formed the new company’s main assets, while the Romanian partner offered land and the containers needed to produce the specialised emulsion. </p>\r\n<p>This decision proved to be extremely helpful, according to the Managing Director, since the existence of the Romanian partner ensured that legal procedures would be followed without any problems, while the two partners shared a common understanding owing to their extensive collaboration in the past, enhancing trust between the two sides. <a HREF=""_GoBack""></a></p>\r\n<p>As soon as the decision was taken, the managing director informed all employees about the process. There were no reactions from employees, as most were used to travelling back and forth quite often during projects in Greece and abroad and the majority of employees were aware of the emerging opportunities in the Romanian market. As a result, no significant problems were reported, since there would be no reductions in employment. On the contrary, employees were extremely active participants during the implementation of the restructuring event, since their expertise was a crucial asset during the period April–July 2009 when the new production unit was set up in Romania. During this period, some 3–4 employees had to move to Romania, in order to monitor the whole process and train their Romanian colleagues in the production of the specialised emulsion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Despite extensive experience of operating in a foreign market, there were some important challenges and constraints evident during the restructuring process. The first one was time – given that the production unit had to be set up in less than four months, due to the company’s obligation to start working there in August 2009. As the managing director stated, this constituted a significant source of pressure for everyone, including the Romanian partner, given the increased workload imposed by the tight time schedule. </p>\r\n<p>Apart from the legal procedures that were necessary in order to form this joint venture in Romania, which in the end did not constitute a problem, given the involvement of the Romanian partner, Aktis also had to ensure that the production unit and related equipment would be fully operational from the outset, a fact that constituted a form of technical constraint. This was a major challenge, since the Romanian partner lacked the skills and knowledge regarding the setting up and use of the acquired equipment. As a result, several employees from Greece, mainly technical staff, had to visit the new production unit, in order to monitor the process and train their Romanian colleagues. As one employee involved in this process stated, this was not an easy task to perform, since it required different skills and adaptation to a different working mentality for both parties. However, their expertise proved to be a critical success factor since, as the managing director admits, the procedure would pose several additional barriers if there was no valuable support from personnel employed in Greece.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, a financial constraint was also apparent, since the company already had extended loan debts, owing to the recent acquisition of other specialised equipment necessary to participate in projects outside Greece. However, the managing board reached an agreement with a Greek bank to finance the investment through an equipment leasing scheme; this proved to be extremely helpful during the restructuring process and the general manager reported it to be a rather smooth process, since the Greek banks were more supportive back then, compared to the current situation, in which a general reluctance to finance Greek SMEs is evident.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The case study findings confirm the informal and internal character of restructuring events in Greek SMEs. The whole planning and execution process mainly involved the managing board, the managing director and the employees. No external support was received in this case for two reasons: first, public support instruments are not able to cover the needs of most Greek SMEs, especially when a company decides to delocalise (parts of) its activities abroad. On the contrary, this decision is considered a negative form of exit from the country, as it usually results in decreasing employment. Second, both the members of the managing board as well as the company’s employees (including those in Greece and the Romanian partner) have extensive experience through an active engagement in the sector in recent past years. As a result, taking up private external assistance was not considered at all, at least in the sense of consulting services.</p>\r\n<p>Financial support received through the banking sector, involving the equipment leasing agreement, was an extremely significant factor for the successful implementation of restructuring. Despite that, though, the managing director holds a negative view of the banking sector’s functioning in Greece, especially nowadays, during the ongoing financial crisis. The agreement his company was able to reach in 2009 would not have been possible today, owing to the banks’ reluctance to support Greek SMEs even though they have received valuable financial support from the Greek government. </p>\r\n<p>The company managed to implement restructuring successfully by relying primarily on employees. This involved Greek employees commuting and training staff employed in Romania, and reliance on employees whose expertise proved to be of crucial importance during the whole period of restructuring. An indicative example refers to a person previously employed on a contractual basis in Romania, who is a chemical engineer and was actively involved in the process of setting up the production unit there. As the managing director of Aktis reported, even though this collaboration pre-existed, it was significantly intensified during the implementation period, in terms of workload and payment levels. The expertise of this chemical engineer was essential in order to complete the installation of the new mechanical equipment in Romania.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The outcomes of restructuring are evaluated positively by both the managing director and by a representative of the employees, since the number of employees remained the same in Greece and some 10 jobs have been created in Romania. Even though Aktis was not able to implement restructuring during the scheduled period, this did not affect the evaluation of the process as a whole. The company was forced to continue with the transport of the specialised emulsion during the first half of the project in Romania, while the remaining part was completed by using emulsion produced there. Obviously, this has increased the total costs of the project, but, as the general manager stated, this shift proved to be of crucial importance for the company's growth in the long run. Thus, these costs were covered by the savings achieved through the projects that followed.</p>\r\n<p>This shift proved to be of crucial importance, since turnover enhanced financial performance and allowed the company to remain active and competitive. As the managing director argued, the company would not have been able to survive in the current economic recession if it had not been for the internationalisation of the production process to Romania. Indicatively, some 50% of turnover during 2011 was produced in this market, while achieving 30% reductions in total operating costs. These facts illustrate the successful implementation of restructuring and its positive outcomes for company performance.</p>\r\n<p>Future prospects in Romania create a certain level of optimism among the managing board of Aktis, given that market opportunities are far less promising in Greece. The existence of the production unit in Romania, and the establishment of the company’s branch there, are likely to enhance future growth, given their participation in several construction projects there. As a result, the company can reap the benefits of specific competitive advantages in the neighbouring market, a goal less achievable in Greece, since Aktis’ techniques are not always considered to form an advantage in the national market.</p>\r\n<p>A significant employment impact was recorded in Greece. On the one hand, Greek workers were able to enjoy higher wage incomes, given additional pay for working abroad. Added to that, the company’s restructuring created some positive outcomes as far as skills and expertise are concerned. As one employee interviewed noted, they had to turn themselves into trainers overnight in order to help their colleagues in Romania. This was a major challenge, but one in which they proved to be successful, thus representing a form of workforce upgrading.</p>\r\n<p>Equally important are the experiences gained and the managerial lessons learned throughout the whole process. Specifically, the managing director argued that, despite extensive experience from working and collaborating with international companies, the experience gained through restructuring is valuable. He is now aware of the legal procedures regarding the preparation of consolidated balance sheets, and he is also able to monitor the operation of a branch located in another country. The outcomes of the process are extremely positive for company operations and on a personal level as well.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The case of Aktis illustrates a successful instance of vertical integration and expansion by Greek SMEs. This company has managed to fully implement the planned restructuring activities mostly owing to its extensive experience from operating in international markets, the skills and abilities of employees, and by exploiting its competitive advantage in a foreign market, namely specialisation in an innovative technique. Hence, this case seems to highlight that SMEs with a (previous) international orientation are more likely to establish their presence abroad through foreign direct investment, due to the extensive networks of collaborators. Moreover, a high educational level and expertise of the owner/managing director and employees seem to form another critical success factor for companies that wish to expand their activities in international markets.</p>\r\n<p>The main reasons behind the decision to restructure were mostly associated with market specificities, such as restricted access to raw materials, and the lower operational costs of Balkan countries, compared to Greece. Hence, these findings confirm the motivating role of cost differences in internationalisation.</p>\r\n<p>Added to that, this case study highlights, once more, the informal and internal nature of restructuring among Greek SMEs. Most firms that implement a restructuring event rely primarily on their own strengths, while the whole process is usually managed without a detailed plan, as small firms are forced to seize any emerging opportunity. Receiving external assistance to reorganise an SME’s activity is rather unusual among Greek firms, since, as this case also illustrates, the role of the owner and employees are central in this process.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, even though Aktis has managed to implement these radical changes successfully in a very short time and despite the fact that the main goals have been achieved, the company faces difficulties accessing finance. This fact, mainly due to the current economic crisis in Greece, confirms that financing constitutes one of the most significant barriers to growth in Greek SMEs. Restructuring cannot always succeed if this barrier is not removed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Lois Labrianidis and Nikos Vogiatzis, University of Macedonia</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Managing director and an employee from the technical division, Aktis S.A.</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.aktis-sa.gr/en"">http://www.aktis-sa.gr/en</a> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Greece"~"42 - civil engineering"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"globalisation"~"business expansion"~"2012-03-02"
"Amirro, Czech Republic"~"Amirro, s.r.o."~"<p>Since 1997, the Czech company Amirro operates in floating glass processing and manufactures mirrors. Due to an outdated information system and the crisis, the company has endured reduced sales, being forced out by cheaper products from China. Responding to market change, in 2009 the company outsourced IT services to implement a new information system in 2010. Short-term workers were transferred to a temporary agency in 2009–2010 to increase flexibility and reduce costs. Production was shifted from one site to another and streamlined. With two manufacturing plants and a company store, Amirro had 100 employees in 2012.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Amirro s.r.o. was established as a limited liability company in 1997 through a split-off from the Czech-German APPL Spiegel s.r.o., in which Pavel Holejšovský – Amirro’s current owner – and Mr Appl were partners. APPL Spiegel’s main business activity consisted of the distribution of the mirrors produced at the Czech plant in Zeleneč to Germany. Although APPL Spiegel was growing at a rate of 200% annually, Mr Holejšovský withdrew from the company because of deteriorating cash flow and in order to improve the financial situation. Now, Amirro no longer cooperates with APPL Spiegel. However, the positive aspect of this Czech–German cooperative effort was that, despite splitting off, Amirro retained its supplier relationships with German manufacturers of furniture, bathrooms, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Currently Amirro is involved in floating glass processing and the manufacture of mirrors for company interiors, households, bathrooms, and decorative purposes. It is the largest producer of interior mirrors in the Czech Republic. The input materials consist of high-quality floating glass and mirror panels. The company’s primary activities consist of glass-cutting (regular and irregular shapes), grinding, polishing, engraving, and faceting. The manufacturing plant is equipped with machinery for sanding, varnishing, screen-printing, and tempering glass.</p>\r\n<p>Pavel Holejšovský, one of the case study interviewees, is one of the company’s owners and executive officers. The company has a flat management structure, with the owners and executive officers, Pavel Holejšovský and Zdenka Holejšovská (a relative of Mr Holejšovský), at the top, and the general director and the finance and production director at the level beneath them. The restructuring processes are organised centrally, that is, directly by the owners.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Holejšovský has a university education and was originally employed as a technologist at the Kavalier Glassworks. Between 1985 and 1990, he was a state administrative employee. He later established his own mirror manufacturing company, which later merged with APPL Spiegel. At that time, the company (still operating under the name of APPL Spiegel) was based in Zeleneč. It expanded its operations to the former machine and tractor station in Uhlířské Janovice. There are 25 employees at that particular location. The company also purchased premises in Čelákovice, which is the current site of its headquarters and where 72 individuals are currently employed. In 2004, manufacturing operations were transferred to the Čelákovice location from the rented premises in Zeleneč. In addition to the manufacturing plants, the company also owns a company store in Prague-Horní Počernice with three employees. Altogether the company had 100 employees at the beginning of 2012.</p>\r\n<p>As far as the company’s employee structure is concerned, 70% are women. Overall, the employees fall into the older age groups, as the company’s executive officer believes that these individuals have a better work ethic than the younger age group. With regard to potential young employees, the company’s owner mentions that they are frequently uninterested in working in a manufacturing company. In addition, competition in the labour market in Prague is quite high, and therefore young people either take on jobs where the requirements for manual labour are lower or, as the owner mentions, choose to remain unemployed. The educational background of the employees differs according to gender. The female employees tend to have a secondary school education, whilst the male employees generally have lower qualifications. In the case of upper management, the proportion of employees with a university education is higher. As concerns nationality, approximately 10% of the employees are of foreign origin – mostly from Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p>Employee turnover is higher at the Čelákovice plant due to the influence of Prague’s more competitive labour market within the region. (In December 2011, the unemployment rate in Prague-East, the district in which Čelákovice is located, was at 3.3%) In Uhlířské Janovice, which is located further from Prague, the work team is much more stable. (In December 2011, unemployment in the Kutná Hora district was at a level of 9.2%) In spite of the fact that the Ukrainian employees are agency workers, they are more stable and almost irreplaceable within the manufacturing process and hold higher positions, usually as technicians, tool setters, and machine operators. Employee turnover has in fact displayed a certain degree of stabilisation, primarily in relation to the economic crisis.</p>\r\n<p>The company does not have a documented human resource development strategy. According to the executive officer, a company such as Amirro does not need this type of strategy because training needs are met at the moment when they occur. As a result, the company does not organise any external training for its employees. However, as the company’s executive officer claims, the employees learn internally within the company with the assistance of their supervisors and thus ensure their career progress (as can be proven in the case of several production employees). There have been no unions established at the company and there is no works council; however, an effort is made to hold open discussions and information meetings (bi-weekly), at which everyone has the opportunity to voice their personal opinions.</p>\r\n<p>Amirro’s executive officer defines his company as an international enterprise and emphasises that, within the current environment, maintaining a nationalist perspective and opinions does not serve any purpose. The deliveries of glass are provided by a Czech manufacturer; however, that manufacturing plant is owned by the international concern AGC Glass Europe. As far as sales are concerned, approximately 60% of production output is exported. The main Czech customers consist of international DIY chains; however, the company is being forced out by cheaper (and lower quality) products imported from China. As a result, Amirro no longer does business with Baumax and Globus. Further expansion to the German market is planned for the future, aimed specifically at intermediate consumption. At the beginning of 2012, the company began searching for a German partner, as the company’s executive officer believes that his products are not as marketable under the Czech image. In addition, the large German market was the least impacted by the economic crisis.</p>\r\n<p>On the domestic market, specifically through its company store in Prague, Amirro does not achieve even 1% of its total sales turnover. It delivers 40% of its production nationally and the remainder is exported, with 95% of the exports going to European Union countries. In the period 2009–2011, turnover was stable at a level of CZK 90-95 million (€3.6-3.8 million). Prior to the economic crisis, however, turnover was approximately CZK 115 million (€4.6 million in 2008). The company estimated a turnover of CZK 120 million (€4.8 million) for 2009, but many planned contracts were called off. An even larger drop in sales was prevented through the acquisition of new contracts. The company’s profits over the long term have been in the positive numbers, with the exception of 2011, when there was a CZK 2 million (€80,000) loss. In that particular year, the company relied on one large customer who promised a turnover of CZK 15 million (€600,000), but in the end the total was only CZK 7 million (€280,000) and during the interim period, the company’s smaller customers found different suppliers.</p>\r\n<p>In this crisis situation, the company was looking for solutions which would increase its competitiveness. It focused on its weaknesses – an obsolete information system, inflexible employment of workers and low profitability of the plant in Uhlířské Janovice. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>Up to 2009 Amirro used a simple management system designed using Microsoft Access, which collected data separately for production, warehousing and accounting management. This data administration was performed internally. The way the system was set up caused many problems. In addition to the separate data flows, the main problem was the inability to access instant information about production, warehousing and despatching, which made it impossible to react immediately to developments on the market. According to Mr Holejšovský, in today’s fast-moving environment, rapid access to information is invaluable, particularly in relation to further production planning. In this respect, it is possible to say that the restructuring was a flexible response to changes in the market.</p>\r\n<p>The company has had employees working on the basis of short-term contracts since the very beginning (approximately 10% of the employees have such contracts, while the rest of the staff have permanent contracts). However, most of the short-term workers have been of foreign origin (mostly from Ukraine) and this fact caused some difficulties concerning the administration of these workers which required work permits, complicated billing, and other issues. Also the employment of such workers did not allow Amirro’s managers enough flexibility. When there was a lack of contracts, there was not enough work for all the employees, but some of them could not be made redundant immediately as the notice period in the Czech Republic is two months. </p>\r\n<p>Prior to 2008 products produced in Uhlířské Janovice were very similar to those manufactured at the plant in Čelákovice. However, the profitability of this production was low, up to the point of loss, due to the frequent flow of materials and information between this location and the central site in Čelákovice. Originally, the company planned to shut down this manufacturing plant, but due to a fairly capable work team and the lower wages in the region, a decision was made to maintain the production at the site with the condition that it would be rationalised. Therefore the managers of Amirro started to look for a new business opportunity for the plant in Uhlířské Janovice.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Two types of restructuring have taken place within the company. The first type, outsourcing, was accomplished in two different ways: outsourcing IT services and workforce outsourcing. The company also underwent internal restructuring by means of shifting production between Čelákovice and Uhlířské Janovice and rationalising production.</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, the company started cooperating with a Nymburk-based company with regard to the implementation of a new information system. The IT company was contracted on the basis of a recommendation of a friend of Mr Holejšovský. The existing hardware was, however, inadequate and a new server had to be purchased. By chance, at the same time CzechInvest (the investment and business development agency of the Czech Republic) published a call for projects which promoted ICT services in enterprises. The company decided to apply for a subsidy. The subsidy application was prepared in cooperation with an external company. It was subsequently approved and new hardware and software were installed in 2010. This made it possible to establish online interconnectivity between the production and the accounting modules for all three of the company’s sections (the production plants in Čelákovice and Uhlířské Janovice and the company store in Prague). </p>\r\n<p>The second form of outsourcing involved temporary agency workers. In 2009–2010 the company’s management decided to transfer all short-term workers to a temporary agency. The reason for taking this step was to ensure greater workforce flexibility, to decrease the administrative demands associated with the employment of these workers, and, no less importantly, to attain certain financial benefits as the use of agency workers is somewhat less expensive for the company. There was no written plan for implementation of this measure. The entire procedure took a few months from the date of the management announcement as only five people were transferred under the temporary work agencies. Concerning the opinion of the employees on the transfer, their reactions were negative, because their salary decreased after the transfer. Later, all of the temporary workers who experienced the transfer left the company because of various reasons (return to their home countries, death of one worker) and now there are approximately 10 people in the company whose jobs are mediated by the temporary work agencies.</p>\r\n<p>As regards the internal restructuring or more specifically the rationalisation of the business activities of Amirro, thanks to the acquisition of a contract to grind glass nail files for Blažek Glass s.r.o. in 2008, the company was able to place this order in Uhlířské Janovice, where there is no other activity now. After a switch in staff, when an older less ambitious worker was replaced with a very capable younger employee (the older worker retired although he could have continued to work in Amirro in another position), work productivity increased greatly at this branch and the plant currently grinds approximately 150,000 nail files a month. This fact has allowed the production plant to be maintained, and thereby also the jobs in Uhlířské Janovice. The number of employees has not, however, changed significantly since the acquisition of the contract because, as explained above, productivity increased both in Uhlířské Janovice and Čelákovice.</p>\r\n<p>The project for implementing the information system was completed in 2010, although the preparations for this project were started in cooperation with an external firm in 2009 and the running-in period for the system lasted several months after the project was physically completed at the end of 2010. The transfer of all hired personnel to the employment agency took place at the end of 2009 and the start of 2010. These workers continue to be hired also in 2012. The process of rationalising production at the Uhlířské Janovice plant took place from approximately 2008 to mid-2009. There was no precise plan for the above-mentioned restructuring steps – only several key points were documented. Mr Holejšovský believes that in the case of a company as small as this one, a very detailed plan is not necessary. </p>\r\n<p>The company’s employees certainly had to be informed about the implementation of the new information system in order to ensure a smooth conversion to the new system. In this regard, the company cooperated with an external company for providing employee training. In addition, there was one member of the work team who already had experience with the new system. Because the short-term workers have been working at the company since it was established, the introduction of the new working arrangement which caused their transfer under the temporary work agencies, was not anything new as far as the permanent staff was concerned. For this reason, it was not necessary to provide extensive information about this change. Mr Holejšovský describes the relationships between the regular employees and the agency workers (who are Ukrainians for the most part) as peaceful and without animosity. The workers were informed in advance of the new focus of the production at Uhlířské Janovice in order to facilitate their preparation for the new production activities. In fact, this information was gratefully received as, at that time, some employees were feeling very uncertain about the future of operations in Uhlířské Janovice.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The company did not encounter any of the major problems sometimes associated with restructuring. In spite of a drop in salaries of workers who were transferred to a temporary work agency, Mr Holejšovský did not notice any decrease in the productivity of workers. There was only an error made by the consultancy firm at the time the subsidy application was prepared, when it did not take note of a change in the methodological instructions for holding a tender and thus the correct procedure was not followed during the tender for the information system and, as a result, the tender process had to be completed at a later date. Otherwise Mr Holejšovský is not aware of any serious errors that affected the restructuring. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>A subsidy from the Industry and Enterprise Operational Programme provided 60% of the financing for the purchase of the hardware and the software required for implementing the company’s new information system. The total subsidy received was CZK 1,615,844 (approximately €64,000). A loan corresponding to the amount of the subsidy was used for the advance financing for the project. It was not a big problem (concerning negotiations with a bank) to obtain it. The remaining restructuring steps either did not require any financing or the company financed them from its standard operational loan.</p>\r\n<p>Other than the financial support, which Mr Holejšovský considers to have been very beneficial, the company’s executive officer did not feel the need for any special support for the restructuring processes. The company did, however, take advantage of support provided in the form of information at the time the subsidy application was prepared, both from the firm that actually prepared the application as well as from the firm that is currently responsible for administering the company’s information system and which also defined the system requirements for the subsidy application. However, for future cooperation with consultancy firms, Mr Holejšovský recommends selecting only a firm with a good reputation on the market in the interest of preventing any possible misunderstandings. There was a slight problem with the subsidy application for the implementation of the information system, when the consultancy firm did not take note of a change in the methodological instructions for the tender proceedings and, as a result, the proper procedure was not followed in the tender for the information system. Fortunately this problem did not evoke the necessity of resubmitting the application; however, the provided subsidy had to be cut correspondingly. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The benefit of the new information system was summarised by the company’s accountant, Jitka Müllerová (almost ten years employed in Amirro). As an accountant, she has abundant experience with the new information system as well as with the situation prior to the time it was implemented. Mrs Müllerová mentions that the new information system has made her job much easier. Before, she had to complete analyses using data from numerous sources, which was demanding from the perspective of time and also very stressful. Thanks to the interconnectivity between the production and accounting modules, she can export the required data almost instantaneously. The implementation of a barcode system made it possible to obtain immediate data and the company switched over to a just-in-time manufacturing strategy. Another benefit of the barcode system was the introduction of a motivational programme for employees which is based on observation of the employee performance. </p>\r\n<p>Although the search for an ideal setting of the motivation system is still in progress, this change enabled growth of the productivity of work and also most of the workers perceived it positively. There are various reasons for this. Firstly, no punishment for defective work has been implemented. Secondly, the whole production process is better arranged now. The workers can immediately control the amount of already completed products and they do not need to rely on lists on paper or in the head of a foreman.</p>\r\n<p>Outsourcing of temporary agency workers will lead to significantly high savings in labour costs during periods when there is a lack of orders. As far as the hired workers are concerned, from the point of view of Mrs Müllerová, the fact that they are hired through an employment agency has made her administrative tasks much easier (before, the company had to obtain work permits, pay withholding tax, deal with complicated billing, etc.).</p>\r\n<p>Internal restructuring in the form of rationalisation and redeployment of production has created a clear division of tasks between the two Amirro plants in Čelákovice and Uhlířské Janovice. This led to significant savings in the costs associated with transporting materials and preservation of approximately 25 jobs in Uhlířské Janovice. </p>\r\n<p>Although there was no written restructuring plan and all the restructuring steps proceeded on the base of verbal communication, Mr Holejšovský says that it is advisable for the communications between members of the management involved in the restructuring to be documented at least in the e-mail system in order to prevent possible misunderstandings.</p>\r\n<p>According to Mr Holejšovský, the restructuring steps that were completed fulfilled their purpose. At the time they were implemented, the aim of the restructuring measures was not to guarantee immediate growth, but rather to stabilise the company during the economic crisis and to prepare it for future growth. The individual forms of restructuring that were selected made a significant contribution towards this objective. The new information system made it possible to improve the effectiveness of production thanks to setting up a motivational programme for employees (bonuses based on employee performance). In addition, it was possible to preserve the production operations at the Uhlířské Janovice location. Production is now managed in a much more sophisticated manner, material flows in particular, and the company is prepared for further expansion.</p>\r\n<p>Although the number of employees continues to be more or less the same, if the production programme for the Uhlířské Janovice plant had not been modified, it is most likely that production operations would have been completely terminated at this location and all the employees would have been made redundant.</p>\r\n<p>Mrs Müllerová was trained to use the new information system without any problems. The changes associated with the hiring of agency workers became more apparent in the company’s administrative section. The individual permanent employees and agency workers were not affected in any way, as the regular employees were already accustomed to hired workers from the Ukraine (in addition, many of these workers have been at the company for a long time). As far as Uhlířské Janovice is concerned, Mrs Müllerová is glad that production operations were maintained – all in all, she also benefits from this.</p>\r\n<p>No employees were let go as a result of the restructuring if they were performing their work obligations conscientiously. All the redundancies in the period of restructuring related to the natural turnover of employees. The employees’ reactions to the restructuring processes were therefore all positive (especially in Uhlířské Janovice) and the restructuring changes were only for the better.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Mr Holejšovský claims that small and medium-sized enterprises are much more flexible during the restructuring process than is the case with larger companies because SMEs are not as bound by various regulations, directives, etc. during the restructuring process. On the other hand, SMEs lack the expert personnel who would be able to draw attention to the possible risks associated with restructuring steps. As a result, large enterprises can more easily determine the expected results of the restructuring. In addition, they have fewer problems with access to bank loans (the bank that provides Amirro with its operational loan is starting to have more concerns with regard to providing credit to the company for future years, in spite of the company’s almost completely stable financial results). </p>\r\n<p>Mrs Müllerová shares the same opinion as Mr Holejšovský concerning the flexibility of SMEs which is the main advantage of small and medium-sized enterprises due to their flat organisational structure. Many agreements can be reached ‘over lunch’. On the other hand, admits the accountant, certain decisions made within such a small group can be too hasty.</p>\r\n<p>When asked if he has any recommendations for other small and medium-sized enterprises, Mr Holejšovský referred to the current turbulent global economic environment. He said that certainty is required, as uncertainty will require further restructuring. In this regard, he mentioned such things as currency exchange fluctuations, which have a great impact on business success (in the past, the company exported products valued at almost CZK 40 million (approximately €1.6 million) to Russia, but when the dollar weakened in relation to the crown, this was no longer worthwhile and now hardly any products are exported to Russia). For this reason, Mr Holejšovský supports the implementation of the euro in the Czech Republic and has already partially converted to using this particular currency – other than for employee salaries and sales, he conducts all business only in euros. Mr Holejšovský also notes that it is necessary to always be flexible and to respond quickly to market requirements – it is necessary to remain consistently active with regard to seeking out investment companies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Vladan Hruška and Petr Bučina, RegioPartner s.r.o.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Pavel Holejšovský (owner and executive officer of Amirro s.r.o.) and Jitka Müllerová (employee)</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.amirro.cz/cz/index.php"">http://www.amirro.cz/cz/index.php</a></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Czech Republic"~"23 - manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products"~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"internal restructuring*outsourcing"~"2012-03-06"
"Bairaktaris Marble, Greece"~"Bairaktaris Marble S.A."~"<p>Bairaktaris Marble S.A. began operations in Greece in 1987 as a wholesale and retail company in marble processing. Family-run and export-oriented, the company employs 27 high-skilled workers. To expand into the artistic marble processing market, the company bought out PARMO S.A. in 2010 to build a new production unit. The firm had to introduce cutbacks in expenses, let some workers go and take on others, train unskilled workers and cut wages, all at a time when the crisis was affecting export sales and product prices. Yet the company maintains a strong competitive advantage.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Bairaktaris Marble S.A. (BM) is a wholesale and retail company engaged in marble processing. Its main products include columns, bollards, tiles, monuments and the resurfacing of fireplaces. The company holds a competitive advantage in the artistic marble processing market. It is one of only two Greek firms currently operating in this market, owing to the owners’ high skills and the technical equipment it owns. BM is housed in privately owned facilities of 22,000 square metres in the industrial area of Drama, close to the border with Bulgaria in the north-eastern part of Greece. Customers include commercial companies from the Greek and foreign market, and individual clients seeking customised products.</p>\r\n<p>Bairaktaris Marble S.A. was founded in 1987 by the current managing director’s father, who had worked for a long time in the marble processing industry. Despite its legal status, BM is a family business, since the shareholders include three family members (a father and his two sons), and a German entrepreneur who has worked with the company in the past, being the owner of another SME himself. The founder’s two sons are now in charge of the company (as managing director and production manager); the founder remains on as chairman. Sales reached €1.6 million in 2011. There are 27 employees, the majority of whom are higher education graduates and skilled craftsmen with numerous years of experience; however, there is no works council or trade union at the workplace.</p>\r\n<p>BM has a strong orientation towards exporting and has established a dynamic international presence since its early years of operation, since some 60% of the production is for sale to export clients. However, given that large quantities are exported through wholesalers, the general manager was not able to provide accurate figures regarding the countries to which the products are shipped. The company was engaged in an international agreement in 2009, which involved the construction of an impressive convention centre in Uzbekistan, where 4,500 people from Europe were employed for the nine months taken to complete the project. Participation in this project arose out of previous cooperation with the German company that undertook to construct this building, while it allowed BM to diversify its production by acquiring specialised machinery that can be used in artistic marble processing. At the same time, it enhanced the company’s experience of international collaboration, while it also contributed to a significant increase in cash flow. This constituted one of the major drivers of restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>Management of the company is undertaken by the three family members, reflecting a centralised structure. The company founder retains an advisory role, owing to his extensive experience in the sector, while the two sons are in charge. One of them, the managing director, received a degree in business economics after his studies in Germany, while the other, the production manager, is a sculptor, with a degree in fine art. Hence, it could be argued that their joint expertise constitutes a competitive advantage for the company.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Following the Uzbekistan project, the owners realised the potential in the artistic marble processing market, given that two specialised machines which had been bought to cover project needs remained idle mainly due to space restrictions, as the area of the company's production unit was not large enough to install them. At the end of 2009, the family considered investing in a new production unit, in which this specialised equipment could be fully operational. At the same time, it was obvious that access to raw materials should be further enhanced, given that local suppliers had reached extensive agreements, mainly with international wholesalers and the vast majority of quarried marble was exported to countries such as China.</p>\r\n<p>The family examined three alternative solutions to overcome these barriers to growth. The first involved building a new production unit in a rented area, so that the owners could take advantage of the subsidies available through the National Investment Law. The second referred to a buy-out of an existing company, since the area presents an extremely strong concentration of marble industry firms. According to various estimates, the prefectures of Drama and Kavala represent almost 70% of the total volumes of exported marble from Greece. Unsurprisingly, this area presents a strong concentration of Greek firms engaged in the sector, the majority of which have undertaken significant exporting activities mainly to the Balkan region, Italy, Spain, China and Hong-Kong. The third alternative included moving the production unit to Bulgaria, where a strong concentration of Greek-owned firms has occurred during the last 20 years, mostly owing to lower labour costs, geographical proximity and the favourable business environment. The first solution appealed most to the family and, thus, the necessary procedures were followed in order to submit a proposal and receive funding through the Greek State under investment law.</p>\r\n<p>The third solution was rejected, mostly for emotional reasons, as the family preferred to retain the company’s activities fully within Greece. However, despite initial efforts to build a new production unit in Drama, the owners were concerned with reported delays in project approvals and funding under the Greek Development Law. This is why the family decided to keep an eye, as the managing director stated, on a possible merger/acquisition with an existing company in Greece.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, during the first months of 2010, the family realised the potential of a possible buy-out of a company in the industrial area of Drama, namely PARMO S.A. Negotiations were initiated, while an examination of company financial data was carried out, in order to evaluate past performance and future prospects. The family was soon convinced that this option constituted the most suitable solution to expand in the artistic marble processing market, while retaining the standard production line, meaning that an efficient combination could be achieved. Hence, the first option, of building a new production unit, was rejected and the family decided to proceed with the acquisition of PARMO S.A. as soon as possible, in order to grab the opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The family moved fast regarding the acquisition and, as a result, a detailed plan was not set out, apart from some general goals, such as to complete the acquisition and implement the necessary changes within the same year. Thus, the buy-out was officially completed on 1 July 2010, meaning that it was finalised two to three months after the opportunity arose. The procedure was entirely managed by the three family members, along with the company tax consultant. The expanded company was now renamed ‘Bairaktaris Marble S.A.’. At the same time, the owners decided to implement a vertical integration process, which involved renting a quarry 35 km from the production unit, in order to secure access to raw materials.</p>\r\n<p>The new owners identified several weaknesses in the new company such as low productivity, high wages, a different working mentality evident among some of the workforce and wide-ranging expenses. These factors constituted a barrier to accomplishing the main goals of the acquisition and, hence, the owners chose to implement further restructuring measures, such as a major cut-back in expenses, operations and labour, which included redundancies and the replacement of four to five employees. Thus, even though total employment remained roughly the same, the managing director believed that an increase in productivity rates could be achieved. Moreover, training schemes were implemented, especially for the unskilled workforce, which involved familiarisation with the new technologies, and the specialised machines installed in the processing unit. Lastly, negotiations with the company’s bank took place in order to reach a new agreement about loan repayments, and a final agreement was reached regarding the renting of the quarry. The general manager stated that they were lucky enough to initiate negotiations before the ‘real’ impacts of the current economic crisis appeared, in the sense that Greek banks are nowadays more reluctant to offer loans to SMEs, owing to the negative economic climate in the country. Thus, this process was rather smooth.</p>\r\n<p>These measures were announced by the management as soon as the new owners came into business, by informing PARMO's employees that these procedures would be executed during the next two months. This raised employee concern and caused some reactions (mainly a legal dispute between a particular worker and the new management – see below), which were partially counterbalanced by the fact  that all legal procedures would be followed, such as the provision of compensation (for example, redundancy payments). The absence of collective employee representation further enhanced the success of these procedures, which were implemented during the scheduled period. At the same time, BM's original employees were also informed about these plans during this stage, even though there was no direct impact on them.</p>\r\n<p>By applying a combination of restructuring measures, such as acquisition, business expansion, internal restructuring and insourcing, the owners felt that company performance would be significantly improved, while the major goal of focusing on artistic marble processing could be secured. However, a detailed plan and timetable was not prepared, owing to the new owners not being fully aware of several problems emerging after acquisition. Hence, efforts were undertaken, during the family’s meetings, to set milestones for each procedure and implement the necessary changes until the end of the year. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>A major challenge in these restructuring events centred on the managing board’s ability and experience to perform such a combination of radical changes in the newly formed company. As the managing director stated, things proved to be more difficult and complex at the end than they seemed at first. Specifically, one significant challenge was the legal status of the company (S.A. – unlimited liability), whose management is different and requires enhanced skills and capabilities, compared to a ‘general partnership’ (that is, limited liability type of business). As the general manager reported, the expenses related to the publication of annual financial data – which is obligatory for an S.A. – are much higher than expected, while the same is true for other operational expenses. The managing board was not fully aware of these specificities and this proved a hindrance to the successful implementation of restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>The owners were also not fully aware of the work mentality and the productivity rates among the acquired company’s personnel. As a result, they were forced to implement some changes related to the number of employees (firings and hirings), which resulted in some unexpected expenses in the form of compensation. However, the total number of employees remained roughly the same, as five people left the company and four new employees came into the business. These changes prolonged the restructuring event, given they were not planned from the outset. Additionally, it created some psychological pressures among the remaining workforce and the owners had to (re)establish an effective communication link in order to improve their relationship with employees. Specifically, as one employee mentioned, there was a 'certain air of tension' between the new owners and the employees, given that the new measures (firings, hirings, and wage reductions) were announced as soon as the former took over the management of the company. Hence, an anxiety was evident as well as a rather negative attitude towards the new management, which led the owners to apply some measures to mitigate the negative results (for example, daily communication with the employees in order to confirm that no more firings would be made).</p>\r\n<p>Another constraint involved the absence of any type of ‘external’ assistance regarding the management of the whole process. As the managing director admitted, the lack of an efficient advisory service constituted a major problem, given that the owners lacked the expertise or previous restructuring experience. Both the scope and the intensity of the implemented changes, combined with the strategic reorientation that was necessary, rendered the utilisation of external assistance extremely significant, especially in terms of legal and strategic management consulting services. However, this could not be achieved either through the public or the (local) private sector. This is why the managing director is seeking cooperation with a consultancy company in Thessaloniki, even though he believes this will be extremely difficult, owing to the peculiarities of the marble processing industry, which should be taken into account in order to plan and execute a programme with realistic and achievable goals.</p>\r\n<p>The timing of the restructuring event constituted another major constraint in two different ways. First, the deteriorating business environment, due to the economic crisis in Greece, put extended pressures on sales, as regards the standardised production line in particular (for example tiles). On the one hand, it caused a reduction in sales in the national market (in the firm’s particular market segment), while, on the other hand, it affected levels of trust among foreign clients and created pressures regarding price levels. As the managing director stated, orders would be completed through a single phone call or fax before the crisis, but now the procedure has become much more complex, since international companies have become more ‘suspicious’ of Greek companies. Obviously, this has affected implementation and the success of restructuring, in that it harmed the particular market segment that the owners believed would support diversification into artistic marble processing. Specifically, the general manager stated that his family believed that sales of the company (referring to exports to wholesalers, that is 'standardised production') would provide the necessary capital to invest in the 'artistic marble processing industry', something that was not achieved, given the economic downturn that affected export sales after 2010.</p>\r\n<p>Second, the rental of the quarry to ensure access to raw materials has not yet proved to be a suitable solution, for environmental reasons. Specifically, the winter of 2011 was one of the worst recorded in Drama and heavy snow hampered the quarrying of marble in satisfactory quantities due to heavy snow. Hence, the owners are not in a position to predict the volume of future production. As the general manager reported, some two or three fully operational months of quarrying are needed in order to be able to predict the future levels of extracted raw materials.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was exclusively developed and managed by the three family members. This is attributed to the lack of public or private sector support, at least in the type of consultancy or financing mechanisms that were essential in the specific case. Hence, the owners relied primarily on their own skills and experience, while support was received internally from an employee, the company's accountant, who has worked for BM during the past years. His help was valuable, according to our interlocutor, in the sense of providing advice and support related to the evaluation of the financial performance of the target company, even though a relative lack of expertise was evident in this case as well, as this person has been working with the family in their previous business (that is a ‘limited liability’ type) and he was not always able to assist them in the management of the acquired company, due to differences (in the legislative framework) between the two types of companies.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, apart from the necessity of a specialist consultant who could advise the owners as regards the strategic reorientation of the company as a whole, a significant need emerged <i>vis-à-vis </i> the procedure of buy-out and management of the acquired firm. The managing director identified several differences with regard to expenses in a company of this specific legal type (S.A.) that were not foreseen. This lack of experience constituted a significant barrier to restructuring that has augmented the need for an external consultant, for whom the firm would pay. This need is related to management and the evaluation of alternative growth strategies that can be implemented and executed in the near future. However, as previously mentioned, the company has not had access to this particular type of support, either through the public or the private sector.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding public support, the instruments available at national level primarily target the establishment or restructuring of larger companies and, as a result, the managing director stated that alternative options were assessed (such as building a new production unit). However, once more, the extended delays and the bureaucratic procedures that characterise the Greek administrative system as regards the business environment were reported as being the greatest obstacle. Thus, even though financial assistance was required during the restructuring event, the owners decided to rely mainly on family backing in the form of private capital injections. The major concern reported relates to the means that could assist – especially the smaller – Greek firms to overcome the barriers created by the recession and deteriorating business opportunities. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The assessment of financial results during the first year after restructuring produces a mixed picture. The managing director stated that none of the  goals have  been entirely met, for various reasons. First, the economic crisis has severely affected the company’s annual sales in the standardised products market. Moreover, it has also created enormous pressures for price discounts mainly from foreign customers, such as international trading companies. Given the undifferentiated nature of products in this market, their demand exhibits a strong price elasticity, which has also increased competition from neighbouring producers, such as those in Bulgaria. The general manager stated that, partially as a result of the crisis, competition from Bulgarian competitors has increased, as they have been able to enter the local and national market. This rising competition has undoubtedly affected restructuring outcomes, at least in this market segment, which was not fully appreciated prior to restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>Restructuring has also affected the employment side: five employees of the acquired firm have been made redundant, while a wage reduction scheme was also brought in for inexperienced or less skilled employees. On the one hand, these procedures have improved financial performance, but, on the other, have created anxiety among the remaining workforce. It is worth mentioning that there is a continuing legal dispute between the company and a dismissed employee over the compensation offered to him. Even though this was a single incident, it illustrates the negative impacts, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, restructuring can pose to employment. On the other hand, there have not been any direct impacts on the initial employees of BM.</p>\r\n<p>The vertical integration efforts, which involved quarry rental to ensure access to raw materials, cannot be assessed positively so far. However, given declining orders in the standardised products’ market, it might have not constituted a major problem until today, as customer demand could be covered by relying on long term supplier networks. Indeed, though, a certain level of worry was observed regarding the outcome of this decision, particularly about the exact levels of materials to be extracted, since the owners are not yet able to estimate them. </p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, the outcomes of the restructuring  are evaluated in a more optimistic manner by both the managing director and an employee who was also interviewed, regarding productivity rates and employees’ working mentality. Specifically, the owners have successfully implemented changes involving the knowledge and skills of the personnel by clearly demonstrating a different management culture that can also enhance the upgrading of the workforce. This is related to the new machinery in the production unit, whose operation requires new employee skills, as well as to the different environment in which the company functions, which is more internationalised but also more family-orientated, thus ensuring a more favourable working environment. As one employee said: ‘It feels good to see a family working here all day long, even on Saturdays, compared to the previous situation. The previous owners were almost invisible here. Hence, the current situation certainly creates a family-like atmosphere for all of us working here’.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, outcomes are more promising as regards the artistic marble processing segment. A major goal, which involved the installation and exploitation of previously idle mechanical equipment, was met, offering the company a major opportunity to expand in this market, where competition is less intense and profit margins are considerably higher. This area constitutes a strong competitive advantage, while it has also allowed the owners to fully take advantage of their experience and expertise, a fact that constitutes a major positive impact of the restructuring process.</p>\r\n<p>Hence, the owners are currently in the phase of inducing further changes in the future, which illustrate the ‘learning by doing’ fashion in the case of this particular case of restructuring. The outcomes so far could be characterised as moderate and even though certain goals have not been achieved, the owners are optimistic they will manage to overcome the barriers, even if the process is prolonged.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The case of Bairaktaris Marble S.A. constitutes a good example of restructuring among smaller firms in Greece. It is characterised by an extended mix of actions and types of restructuring events (that is internal restructuring, insourcing, acquisition), combined with the relatively small size of the firm and the low levels of experience related to implementing radical changes. It clearly demonstrates the need for external assistance (especially in the form of consulting services) and possible barriers for smaller firms, such as restricted  access to finance and lack of consultancy experts specialised in particular sectors.</p>\r\n<p>Partially as a result, the process is managed by the owners, which confirms the general argument regarding their ‘hegemonic’ role in the management of smaller firms. At the same time, lack of expertise and experience does not seem to hinder the restructuring efforts <i>per se</i>, but rather their efficiency. Concretely, as the case of BM illustrates, owners and managers in these smaller firms are often forced to implement radical changes in their businesses even though they lack the experience. However, they are able to proceed by employing a ‘learning by doing’ approach and by relying on the company’s internal strengths, even in the absence of a well-defined and accurate plan, given that there are often  factors that cannot be foreseen.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, the case of BM showcases the vulnerability of smaller firms to the deteriorating business environment, such as the one currently prevailing in Greece during times of economic crisis. In turn, this can affect employment severely, in the form of redundancies or wage reductions, which seem to be the only solution, especially for labour-intensive firms, to remain active, given their limited access to finance that is further restricted during this financial recession mainly by the banking sector.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Lois Labrianidis and Nikos Vogiatzis, University of Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Managing Director and an employee in the Human Resources Department, Bairaktaris Marble S.A.</p>\r\n<p><b>Company address</b></p>\r\n<p>Bairaktaris Marble S.A.</p>\r\n<p>Industrial Area of Drama66100 Drama </p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.marmaro.eu/"">http://www.marmaro.eu/</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Greece"~"8 - other mining and quarrying"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring*merger / acquisition"~"2012-03-01"
"Boutiquehotel Stadthalle Wien, Austria"~"Boutiquehotel Stadthalle Wien"~"<p>The owner/manager of the Austrian Boutiquehotel Stadthalle Wien was surprised by the media interest that was sparked when she expanded her premises to make it the first zero-energy-balance hotel in Vienna. By taking advantage of this, she achieved national and international awareness for her hotel. Two to three years after the restructuring, her company’s performance is not only considerably higher than anticipated, but the hotel has also received several awards and has been the subject of numerous national and international press articles.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The Viennese three-star Boutiquehotel Stadthalle Wien is the world’s first zero-energy balance (ZEB) hotel in urban areas. The hotel has 80 rooms, 38 of which are located in a new building, the construction of which is the subject of this case study.</p>\r\n<p>Respect for nature and its resources can be seen in all the company’s activities. For example, the hotel uses solar energy for heating and rain water for toilet flushes. Guests are also offered a 10% reduction on their room price if they travel by train or bike. If they have electric cars they can charge them for free at the hotel’s electric fuel station. Also, the substantial breakfast buffet consists, as far as possible, of organic food.</p>\r\n<p>Michaela Reitterer is the sole owner and manager of the HS Hotelbetriebs GmbH of the  Boutiquehotel Stadthalle Wien which administers the hotel and the real estate. Furthermore, she is the chair of the Österreichischen Hotelvereinigung (ÖHV), the Austrian association of hotels. Before she bought her parents’ business in 2002, she ran a travel agency and worked as assistant to the chief executive officer of a catering company.</p>\r\n<p>The Boutiquehotel Stadthalle Wien employs 32 staff members, which corresponds to 26 full time equivalents. Skilled and unskilled workers as well as administrative staff are active in four areas: housekeeping, breakfast service, reception and utilities management. There is no works council in the company.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In 2002, Michaela Reitterer bought the hotel ‘Zur Stadthalle‘ from her parents and decided to consider ‘environmental awareness’ as the main vision of the company. Her parents were already interested in this issue and their hotel had been certified with the Austrian ‘Ecolabel’. Michaela Reitterer wanted to follow this route. Just after taking over the hotel in 2002 she had a solar energy plant installed. It is important personally for her to use natural resources and environmentally friendly and protective measures as far as possible, even if this does not immediately result in financial savings for the business.</p>\r\n<p>In spite of the fact that, with the solar energy plant and the other environmentally friendly measures, the hotel was already the leading hotel with regard to the environment and sustainability in Vienna at this time, Ms Reitterer did not feel these measures were sufficient. Consequently, in 2007 she started planning a ZEB hotel which was to be an expansion of the initial company. At the same time, the original hotel was to be renovated to guarantee a coherent character of the whole company.</p>\r\n<p>The aim of the restructuring was to increase the level of ecological sustainability the company was already embracing. Michaela Reitterer was more inspired by her personal interest in using natural resources than by the business idea.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Next door to the hotel which Ms Reitterer had bought from her parents, there was a residential building in a poor structural condition, which she also owned. She decided to have this demolished and a new hotel building erected in its place to expand the existing company. This new building was planned as a ZEB hotel.</p>\r\n<p>When Ms Reitterer started in 2007 to develop her idea for a ZEB hotel, she soon realised that this was nationally and internationally an innovative issue. Environmental considerations were not yet very widespread in tourism or the economy in general, but there was increasing interest. Accordingly, there were hardly any experts available for her to approach.</p>\r\n<p>As a consequence, it was mainly Michaela Reitterer who planned the new building, in cooperation with a technical planner and an architect. She describes the development of the ideas as a joint process. In the beginning, she pinpointed her objectives and received feedback from the technical planner and the architect regarding the feasibility and implementation of  her ideas. However, the two soon realised what Michaela Reitterer wanted and made suggestions themselves. Some of them were incorporated, some rejected. In the later process – during the construction site meetings – other craftsmen and specialists involved in the construction of the new building also made suggestions that were jointly evaluated.</p>\r\n<p>The planning phase took about one year, during which Michaela Reitterer met the technical planner and the architect about every two to four weeks. The entrepreneur describes this process as ‘intensive’.</p>\r\n<p>During this year, the required construction and operating approvals were applied for and received. Long waiting periods were experienced. However, this did not delay the progress of the project.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of 2008, the construction of hotel began. The new six-storey building had 38 guest rooms. It was concrete with a façade specific to a ZEB house. The new building is a stand-alone structure, linked to the initial hotel only in the cellar and the ground floor. Plastic pipes through which water is circulated were installed in the massive ceilings and walls, enabling controlled heating and cooling. Furthermore, a photovoltaic plant was installed.</p>\r\n<p>During the construction of the new building, the original hotel was also renovated (being given for example, a new heating system, new windows, and LED lighting) to ensure a coherent and authentic link between the existing hotel and the new building. At the beginning of the renovation, the original hotel was completely closed. During this period guests were accommodated in a nearby little boarding house also belonging to Ms Reitterer. One of the rooms of the boarding house was temporarily used as an office to administer sales and reception.</p>\r\n<p>Of the 18 staff members working at this time at the hotel, about six or seven were employed in the boarding house during the renovation. These were mainly receptionists and cleaners. The other employees were temporarily dismissed (for differing durations, but with a maximum of four months), but given a written offer of reemployment. After completion of the renovation, all of them were reemployed. The employees could freely choose whether they wanted to be employed during the renovation or not, and the majority opted for a brief break which was, for example, used for travel or child care.</p>\r\n<p>The atmosphere within the staff was positive, even somewhat euphoric due to the opportunity of participating in such an innovative project. This can, for example, be shown by the fact that the temporarily dismissed workers repeatedly visited the construction site to see the progress.</p>\r\n<p>As the renovation progressed an increasing number of rooms were rented in the original hotel, and hence the business activity and employee number increased. Potential guests were clearly informed that construction was taking place and prices were adjusted accordingly. These ‘facelift prices’ were favourable for the guests and also cost-effective for the hotel. With the progress of the construction – and the quieter it became – prices were increased again.</p>\r\n<p>The construction of the new building, for which Ms Reitterer herself conducted the site supervision, lasted about 11 months. The opening of the new building took place on 27 November 2009.</p>\r\n<p>When Michaela Reitterer developed her restructuring idea in 2007, she was aware that her ZEB hotel would be the first in Vienna, but she was not aware that she would also take a leading role in city tourism internationally. Accordingly, as soon as her idea became public she was surprised about the media interest. Nevertheless, she immediately took advantage of this for marketing purposes, to achieve national and international awareness for her hotel.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring was financed by a leasing company which drew up an agreement relatively quickly, and without major difficulties. The leasing company recognised the innovation and appreciated it, and it saw some potential for know-how and knowledge transfer for itself.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>A challenge in the restructuring process was the novelty of the idea. Michaela Reitterer repeatedly encountered people who made statements like ‘this cannot be done, as such a thing does not yet exist’. This resulted, for example, in long durations before required authorisations were granted as the authorities had to be convinced about the new ideas first, or there were no any standardised procedures for authorisation. Other challenges were the refusal of the banks to finance the project as the innovative concept was considered as unrealistic or too optimistic, and the very limited access to public financial support.</p>\r\n<p>Another aspect of the novelty of the idea was that there were no or hardly any experts in the field for Ms Reitterer to consult. This situation has since improved, and due to her experience the entrepreneur now knows specialists in various fields who can support her in the further development of her ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Michaela Reitterer involved a technical planner and an architect in the planning of the ZEB building. The technical planner was recommended to her by the environmental advisor who awarded her the Austrian Ecolabel. The technical planner, in turn, recommended an architect with whom he had already built a ZEB building.</p>\r\n<p>She was very satisfied with this cooperation and would happily work again with this team, despite the fact that there are now more experts in this field.</p>\r\n<p>Further support from private consultants was not used. Ms Reitterer carried out all meetings/discussions with banks or authorities herself and conducted the construction site supervision.</p>\r\n<p>She received a small financial grant from the city of Vienna for the erection of the photovoltaic plant. However, this was paid for two years after it was built. Furthermore, she received a small grant from the climate energy fund, stemming from EU funds.</p>\r\n<p>With regard to public support the entrepreneur wishes, first of all, that she could have had better understanding and open-mindedness from the authorities, followed by financial support and technical advice.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The new building not only expands the original hotel but also offers a zero-energy balance. The hotel heating uses water heated by a 130 m2 solar energy plant. A ground-water heating pump, three wind wheels and the more than 80 m2 of large photovoltaic plant create so much energy that not only can the energy needs of new hotel be entirely served, but energy can also be emitted to the original hotel and the ecological electric supply network. The filling of the toilets’ flushing tanks as well as the watering of the garden is done through a rain water collection system. The fresh air for the controlled air conditioning is warmed by a solar energy plant, and during the summer the building can be cooled by cold ground water which is pumped through the concrete ceiling. Thereby, the company does not have to use energy-consuming air conditioning, and energy consumption is also reduced by the use of LED and energy saving lighting reduces.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, more than two years after the restructuring, company performance (guest numbers and sales) is about 20% higher than initially expected. The new building and the renovation of the initial hotel resulted in a doubling of the hotel’s capacity which also led to an increase of the number of employees from 18 to 32. New positions were also created, such as a quality manager and a person responsible for dealing with social media.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, it has to be mentioned that the company restructuring brought about changes for the employees which were not thought of as positive by all of them. There were, for example, staff members who could not cope with the higher pressures related to the now larger hotel. Two of the initial workers left the company for this reason, which can be seen as negligible, bearing in mind the generally high staff fluctuation in tourism. However, there are also employees who feel the current hectic business activity is inspiring and for whom the visits from ministers or EU clerks as well as the media spotlight on the hotel is motivating and rewarding.</p>\r\n<p>Before the restructuring, the entrepreneur expected the changes to improve business. However, she did not expect that the results would be so positive. Business development and progress are now also closely monitored (sales, number of guests), and marketing is strategically conducted.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring was carried out according to the initial concept, but went beyond this in some fields as it was only during construction that some aspects materialised which the entrepreneur could not have foreseen. For example, it became gradually apparent that the guests expected breakfast to be organic, although this is only in a wider context related to the ecologically sustainable concept of the hotel. Nevertheless, this concept was developed in a flexible way, based on demand. To a certain extent also diversification can be seen to have taken place, as next to the hotel’s day to day business activities now there are also activities related to ecological sustainability. For example there are daily tours of the hotel to show the innovations to interested people.</p>\r\n<p>From a personal point of view, the process of planning and implementing the restructuring was a very intensive process for the entrepreneur. However, she did not experience this as such, as she worked towards her objective in a very concentrated way. Only at the end did she realise how exhausting the process had been.</p>\r\n<p>The company is the role model for environmental friendliness and sustainability in tourism in Vienna and has been awarded the EU Ecolabel as well as with numerous Austrian eco awards (for example, Ecolabel of the Republic of Austria, eco award of the city of Vienna, climate protection award, Green Brands Certificate). Furthermore, the hotel is showcased in numerous national and international press articles and events as a successful practical example of what can be done in this field. Ms Reitterer presumes that the reason for this interest from institutions and media is based on the tangibility and the success of her project. Her example shows that measures for ecological sustainability are not only theoretical scenarios, but can be realised in practice and work well.</p>\r\n<p>Together with her team, Michaela Reitterer again and again initiates new projects, particularly to raise awareness among international guests on the topic of sustainability and environment. As a sign of success the entrepreneur would like to further expand the hotel..</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring of the company was a very ambitious undertaking as there were no national or international reference projects for the entrepreneur to follow. However, Michaela Reitterer was of the opinion that somebody needed to make the first step and was willing to take this role. She wanted to show colleagues in the industry, guests, banks and supporting authorities that such an undertaking not only is ecologically valuable and economically sound, but can also set an example for Austrian tourism. To other people thinking of following her example, Ms Reitterer recommends not getting diverted by scepticism from authorities or banks about innovative entrepreneurial ideas, but to question this scepticism in order to arrive at a situation in which arguments and discussions are purely factual.</p>\r\n<p>The entrepreneur mentions the support and motivation of her employees as an important success factor for the restructuring. In this respect, it is important to communicate to the staff from the very beginning the reasons and plans for the restructuring and to get their commitment. A personal management style, as well as the personal commitment by the entrepreneur, are good ways of achieving this. At the same time, the individual needs of employees need to be considered, for example by offering job security if such is necessary while finding other motivators (such as the possibility to participate in innovative developments) if this is more suitable.</p>\r\n<p>Also the optimal timing – to be involved from the very beginning in a new development which later on proved to be seminal – considerably contributed to the success of the new idea.</p>\r\n<p>The entrepreneur sees an important difference between SMEs and large companies: on account of their small scale, SMEs can present their concepts and visions in a way that is more authentic, practical and closer to the needs of its customers, which is a big advantage..  </p>\r\n<p>Michaela Reitterer is very willing to share her experiences, participate in national and international discussions of the topic and advise sectoral colleagues in Austria and abroad. She does not think that this could harm her business due to increased competition as she thinks that the market is large enough and can further benefit from increased customer awareness.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, she applauds the recent trend of including successful entrepreneurs in think tanks, thereby leading to a better liaison of economy, science and policy. In her opinion, this is advantageous for the creation and implementation of innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Irene Mandl, Eurofound</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Michaela Reitterer, owner and manager, Boutiquehotel Stadthalle Wien </p>\r\n<p><b>Company address</b></p>\r\n<p>Boutiquehotel Stadthalle WienHackengasse 201150 Wien</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.hotelstadthalle.at/en"">http://www.hotelstadthalle.at/en</a></p>\r\n<p><i>Practical company examples</i></p>\r\n<p>respACT –- austrian business council for sustainable development: http://www.respact.at/site/projekte/praxisbeispiele/database/359.html (10 August 2012)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Austria"~"55 - accommodation"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"greening"~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2012-03-26"
"Brian Mordaunt & Sons, Ireland"~"Brian Mordaunt & Sons"~"<p>Started up in 1982, the Irish car retail business of Brian Mordaunt & Sons went from selling second-hand cars to having four dealerships under their control by 2007. Helped by the government’s ‘scrappage scheme’, employment grew to 53 people. In 2008, the banking system collapse meant fallen demand for new cars. The company was forced to cut wages, make redundancies and sell cars at a loss to reduce stock. Major financial difficulties meant the company finally closing down in 2011. The owner since started up a smaller venture of selling cars online and employs nine people.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Brian Mordaunt, George Mordaunt&rsquo;s father, started his car retail business, Brian Mordaunt Limited, in August 1982 in Clonmel, the county town of South Tipperary, which has a population of approximately 17,000.</p>\r\n<p>Brian Mordaunt initially focused on selling second-hand cars and in January 1987 invited his eldest son, George, to join the business as a general runner and car polisher. George had been dismissed from two jobs before he started in the family business.</p>\r\n<p>In 1988, the Mordaunts secured the Nissan franchise for the area; Japanese car manufacturers such as Nissan and Toyota had been making a sustained assault on the Irish car market and were perceived to be brands with good sales potential.</p>\r\n<p>Later that year, the family became the local dealership for another car franchise, Daewoo, the Irish franchise of which was owned by Nissan Ireland. The Mordaunts opened the Daewoo dealership as a separate company, Daewoo Clonmel, in a separate location to their Nissan garage. Initially, the family rented the premises for their Daewoo operation but later built a purpose-built showroom.</p>\r\n<p>Between 1989 and 2007, employment in the businesses controlled by the Mordaunt family grew to 53 people. The majority of employees were male in their 20s and 30s and worked in sales, marketing, financial and technical positions. The employees were not members of any trade union.</p>\r\n<p>The Mordaunt group of companies was renowned for its innovative approach to sales and marketing; however, despite the fact that the number of employees had grown to over 50 and involved a considerable recruitment and training process, there was no formal HR policy.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The car market grew strongly in the early 1990s following the introduction of the &lsquo;scrappage scheme&rsquo; under which the Irish Government gave a financial incentive for people owning a car of ten years old or older to trade in for a newer model.</p>\r\n<p>The expansion in the car market prompted a recruitment drive by Brian and George Mordaunt (who were joined in the business by George&rsquo;s younger brother, Brian) to take on more sales staff to handle the extra business. Reflecting the involvement of the two brothers in the business, the company name was changed to Brian Mordaunt &amp; Sons Limited (BMS).</p>\r\n<p>Not everything was rosy: the Mordaunt family had concerns for the future of Daewoo Clonmel following the bankruptcy of the Daewoo conglomerate in 1999 (General Motors acquired Daewoo&rsquo;s motor division in 2001). The Mordaunts later changed the name of their company from Daewoo Clonmel to Mordaunt Chevrolet in 2005.</p>\r\n<p>Tensions arose between George and his father over the future direction of the company: the former wanted to expand quickly while the latter was more cautious. The strained relations between George and his father escalated following the 9/11 crisis when car sales plummeted with the result that the Mordaunts were left carrying a large amount of stock. However, George&rsquo;s flair for advertising meant that the business was able to reduce this to a manageable level.</p>\r\n<p>George&rsquo;s parents had given him 24% of the family business in 1993 but he was frustrated by his lack of control of the business and his father&rsquo;s cautious approach. Following a tense and heated meeting in October 2001, Brian Mordaunt agreed to cede control of the original family company, BMS, to George but, under the deal, retained control of Daewoo Clonmel.</p>\r\n<p>In 2003, a Block Exemption Regulation (BER) was introduced by the European Commission to promote competition in the automobile retail sector by giving car owners the freedom to have their vehicles serviced and repaired at a workshop of their choice. The BER also sought to increase competition between dealers of the same brand and strengthen the dealer&rsquo;s position vis-&agrave;-vis the manufacturers.</p>\r\n<p>One outcome of the BER was that car dealers would be required to build large &mdash; and expensive &mdash; showrooms. The new regulations also specified that garages had to employ a ratio of 1.25 sales staff for every 100 new cars sold.</p>\r\n<p>A more fundamental and immediate impact was that dealers had to re-apply for their franchises and with some existing dealers wanting to retire or being unwilling to make the investment in new facilities, it was inevitable that there would be franchises changing hands.</p>\r\n<p>Aware that there might be a risk that he would lose the Nissan contract, George wrote to the other main car franchise holders in Ireland. He was rewarded with a phone call from Renault who following negotiations awarded him the Renault franchise contract for Clonmel and the neighbouring town of Kilkenny. The new Renault contract required the acquisition of new premises and the recruitment of staff in both locations. George set up a new company, GBM (George Brian Mordaunt), to operate the Renault franchise in Clonmel. He secured loans from three banks to fund the new development, which opened in 2004.</p>\r\n<p>George then opened a Renault dealership in Kilkenny even though he was required to make a substantial investment in the Nissan garage in Clonmel to meet the new showroom requirements; the added complication was that the site was subject to flooding necessitating a complete rebuild.</p>\r\n<p>Using Mordaunt Chevrolet as security, George was able to secure finance for both projects. It resulted, however, in three of the four dealerships controlled by the family having a debt attached to them. The new Kilkenny venture, GBM Cityside, was scheduled to open in December 2006. Renault was keen to involve their existing financial partner in the new arrangement even though George would have preferred to stick with his banks.</p>\r\n<p>With four dealerships under his control at the start of 2007 and though the car market had grown strongly up to that point, George was concerned with his high stock levels of used cars. The major manufacturers dominate the car market in Ireland for whom a key market performance indicator is the number of cars registered (it is important to note that the number of new cars registered does not equate to the number of new cars sold). Dealers were given lucrative incentives to hold new cars and they in turn incentivised customers to buy new cars, often by taking used cars as part-payment.</p>\r\n<p>Two years previously, he had begun to worry about the lack of cash that his dealerships were generating. He consoled himself at the time that this was a common feature in fast-growing businesses and would be temporary.</p>\r\n<p>The growth in the Irish economy resulted in competition for staff and consequently salaries and wages rose as employers vied with each other to recruit sales people to take advantage of the booming consumer market. George Mordaunt found that it was increasingly difficult &mdash; and expensive &mdash; to recruit experienced car sales people and consequently had to put considerable investment in staff training.</p>\r\n<p>Towards the end of 2006, there were signs that sales growth within the Mordaunt group of companies was beginning to tail off. Stock levels of used cars were proving difficult to shift and profits were proving illusory. Despite the rebranding of Mordaunt Chevrolet, the marque never recovered, internationally, nationally or locally. George Mordaunt sought another franchise to attract customers to Chevrolet.</p>\r\n<p>Purchasers of new cars in Ireland must pay two taxes: Value Added Tax (VAT) and a Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT). In 2008, the Government, prompted by its minority partner, the Green Party, changed the basis on which VRT was charged from engine size to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; cars with high emissions would pay a higher VRT while those with lower emissions would pay less. While laudable in intent, from a dealer&rsquo;s perspective the new tax meant that every car had a price adjustment, some up, some down, depending on its emission level. A combination of VAT and the new CO<sub>2</sub> emissions-based VRT changes pushed a number of cars into a higher price bracket. Additionally, high emission cars also incurred a higher level of road tax. The impact for dealers of these developments was that they were now carrying stocks of cars that were substantially more difficult to sell.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>At the end of 2007, while there were storm clouds looming on the horizon, the Mordaunts&rsquo; group of companies had sold over 3,000 cars during the year, generating a turnover of &euro;34 million. George was concerned, however, that the business was not generating any profits nor did it have any cash cushion if there was any downturn in sales.</p>\r\n<p>The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and the full extent of the disastrous lending policies of Irish banks became apparent and sent shockwaves through not only the banking system but also throughout the economy.</p>\r\n<p>Customers stopped visiting George Mordaunt&rsquo;s dealerships, which at the time had large stocks of high emission cars that were proving almost impossible to sell because of the changes in VRT. George developed a new innovative radio advertising campaign that helped to restore customer footfall. This improved cash flow but did result in any profits; in fact, some losses were incurred.</p>\r\n<p>George&rsquo;s employees were aware of the difficulties within the business but it was only afterwards with the publication of his book, <em>Shepherd&rsquo;s Pie: Family Business, Recession and Recovery</em>, that they realised the full extent of the problems he was grappling with. His employees could see that the lack of customer footfall signified a fall in demand for car sales. Sales staff saw their overall income fall because of reduced commissions.</p>\r\n<p>Junior staff had more reasons to worry because they would have known that when a company downsizes it was usually the last in who are the first to be made redundant.</p>\r\n<p>The Mordaunts held review meetings with staff to brief them on the evolving situation; George addressed all employees together approximately four times during the restructuring process. He told them that it was a fight for survival and that nothing should be taken for granted.</p>\r\n<p>As the company&rsquo;s difficulties increased, the salaries of employees were cut (reductions ranged from a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 50%, though in the case of the latter there was a corresponding reduction in responsibility) and a new method for calculating sales commissions was introduced.</p>\r\n<p>George realised that a plan was needed to pilot the business through the crisis; he saw it as his responsibility to develop and implement the plan. One element of the plan involved the closure of the Chevrolet showroom and its relocation to his main Nissan premises. Another element of the plan saw cars being sold at a loss to reduce stock levels.</p>\r\n<p>Despite his strategy for dealing with the difficulties facing his business, George was not prepared for the next thunderbolt: a demand from one of his banking partners to either return the &euro;2 million they had lent him or secure it. To placate this bank, George agreed to secure it on a property that the company owned in Clonmel.</p>\r\n<p>Another shock followed shortly afterwards: the decision of a second banking partner to terminate its relationship with George Mordaunt and to seek the return of their money. They demanded their money back (&euro;0.9 million) within a month.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, George was facing his own personal financial difficulties; his investments in the stock market &mdash; particularly in bank shares &mdash; were showing significant losses. He lost &euro;0.3 million on shares in one bank alone.</p>\r\n<p>In late 2008, George approached Kia Ireland and secured the franchise for Clonmel. He tried to operate the Kia brand in the vacant Clonmel Chevrolet showrooms but the lack of sales and profits forced him to relocate it to his main showroom. He then closed the Chevrolet showrooms for good.</p>\r\n<p>With the business losing money every month, more employees had to be made redundant. These were difficult decisions for George Mordaunt because he soon realised that one round of redundancies was not sufficient, and more redundancies followed (from the first redundancies in September 2008 to the final round in 2011, the Mordaunts let all 53 of their employees go).</p>\r\n<p>The redundancy programme operated initially on a last-in&ndash;first-out basis but then the Mordaunts introduced a points system which evaluated senior employees on past performance and future ability. As noted above, George organised four major briefing sessions for staff to apprise them of the difficult situation facing the business. The employees could see for themselves that sales were falling and therefore knew the business was in trouble, and because of the dynamics of small towns they also had to contend with rumours circulating about the impending closure of their employer&rsquo;s business. Employees experienced a shock when following the company&rsquo;s decision to change its redundancy selection method from a last in-first out to a points-based system a senior manager was let go. This change brought home to long-serving employees that their jobs might not be as safe as they previously had thought.</p>\r\n<p>The employees noticed that George was constantly closeted away in meetings with managers, suppliers and bankers. With these meetings taking place behind closed doors and in the absence of any communication from management, the internal rumour mill went into overdrive, further adding to the employees&rsquo; sense of anxiety. As mentioned above, it was only after the publication of George&rsquo;s book that they became aware of the full extent of the challenges he was facing to keep the business alive.</p>\r\n<p>It soon became apparent to George that he did not have enough working capital to keep all four dealerships operational. He decided to close the newest one, GBM Cityside in Kilkenny. He discussed the matter with the bank that had financed the property but following their advice decided not to follow through with the decision. The bank advocated holding onto the business to see if the market would recover.</p>\r\n<p>Six months later, he followed through on his original decision and closed the Kilkenny operation. He realised he should not have discussed strategy with the bank; if he had followed his own instinct he could have saved money &mdash; money which was needed to support his other dealerships.</p>\r\n<p>Trading conditions continued to worsen and the business continued to haemorrhage cash. George had to deal with relentless pressures from distributors, banks and the tax authorities, all of which were simultaneously seeking reports on the business, particularly in terms of its ability to pay its debts.</p>\r\n<p>High levels of car stocks proved stubbornly difficult to shift but George managed, between March 2008 and July 2009, to reduce these from a value of &euro;6.7 million to &euro;1.2 million. Reducing the level of stocks was important &mdash; even though George incurred huge losses in doing so &mdash; in persuading his bank in 2009 to provide working capital. The bank took six months to finally approve the loan. There were a number of conditions attached to the new finance and all of the business&rsquo;s assets (bar the family home) were now used as collateral for the new finance.</p>\r\n<p>George and his brother, Brian, had made a number of trips to the UK to examine the feasibility of importing second-hand cars into Ireland. They hired a UK consultant to open doors to them in the UK car trade.</p>\r\n<p>The Mordaunts took the decision in 2009 to wind down their second oldest company, Mordaunt Chevrolet.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, as part of the process of closing the Kilkenny dealership, George Mordaunt had to put two companies, GBM Motors and GBM Cityside, associated with it, into voluntary liquidation. These liquidations took place in January 2010 and unfortunately for him attracted the attention of the national press. One national newspaper, the <em>Irish Independent</em>, featured a story on the two liquidations and, more damagingly, used the Renault logo and the logo of GBM Cityside in its detailed article.</p>\r\n<p>Two days later, Renault summoned George Mordaunt to its head office and told him that their relationship was ending. George was devastated by the news as he had planned to base his recovery on the Renault franchise which was experiencing good sales. He closed the Renault operation in Clonmel in March 2010.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, the Mordaunt family closed their last remaining company, Brian Mordaunt &amp; Sons, and made all of their remaining employees redundant. The Mordaunts also handed back their two last remaining franchises, Nissan and Kia.</p>\r\n<p>With new external funding, George Mordaunt and his brother, Brian, set up a new company, wesourcenecar.com, trading as the Mordaunt Group, in 2011 to source new and second-hand cars for customers. Their new company now employs nine people (including two part-time employees).</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>George Mordaunt faced a number of challenges in restructuring his business. Firstly, he had to make a number of employees redundant. In a small town such as Clonmel, making employees redundant was difficult, both personally and professionally. George and his family socialised in the same circles as the families of the employees being made redundant which created its own tensions.</p>\r\n<p>The very public liquidation of his two newest companies brought a host of unwelcome local and national media attention. Additionally, the dynamics of small towns is such that news &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; circulates quickly and also gives rise to a particular Irish trait of taking pleasure in others&rsquo; misfortune. A number of rumours about the business began to circulate Clonmel &mdash; one even suggested that George had left the country.</p>\r\n<p>More ominously for George, the negative publicity reached Renault which was not happy to see its logo in an article on the closure of George&rsquo;s garages in Clonmel and Kilkenny in Ireland&rsquo;s largest selling newspaper. The unfavourable publicity was one of the factors that precipitated Renault&rsquo;s decision to end its business relationship with the Mordaunts.</p>\r\n<p>A major constraint on George&rsquo;s efforts to restructure his businesses were the banks who were facing a significant business crisis of their own &mdash; namely, an inability to raise funds largely because of the huge losses they were carrying &mdash; and thus many were not in a position to provide funding for the changes that he planned in the business. Additionally, the banks that did have access to funds took a long time to make up their mind.</p>\r\n<p>The extent of borrowing by his various businesses was also an impediment to the restructuring process, as was the lack of cash reserves. As George&rsquo;s business had grown from one dealership to four, so too had the level of external borrowing. The lack of attention to car stocks also had a negative impact on profitability, with the result that the business was poorly resourced internally to fund the restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>George&rsquo;s own personal resources that he might have been able to contribute to the re-structuring of the business were already depleted as a consequence of his ill-judged investments on the stock market.</p>\r\n<p>George says that, if he is brutally honest, in retrospect he should have reduced his staff count quicker and he should not have made any redundancy payments because this decreased his working capital that he needed for his business to survive. He says he would have told all of his employees being made redundant to seek redundancy payments from the State (the very last group of his employees did not, in fact, receive any redundancy payments from the company). If an employer cannot afford to pay the full statutory redundancy lump sum payment to their employees the Department (Ministry) of Social Protection &mdash; which is responsible for the social security system in Ireland &mdash; will make payment out of the Social Insurance Fund, provided that the employer provides evidence that they are not in a position to pay. Recently audited accounts, or a statement of affairs signed by accountant/auditor would be accepted as evidence of the employer&rsquo;s inability to pay.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The Irish economy had, up until 2006, been on an uphill growth curve since the mid-1990s &mdash; even though it is now realised that the latter years of the so-called &lsquo;Celtic Tiger&rsquo; were built on a credit-fuelled boom. This period of continuous economic growth meant that many Irish entrepreneurs had never experienced a severe business downturn and thus were ill prepared for dealing with adverse market conditions &mdash; and, more importantly, with a dysfunctional banking system. For the same reason, there were no external advisers who could provide advice and support to George in the restructuring of his business &mdash;particularly in terms of his dealings with the banks who were going through a severe funding crisis of their own.</p>\r\n<p>At one stage in the restructuring process, George sought the advice of one of his banks on what he should do with his newest dealership, the Renault operation in Kilkenny; his own inclination was to shut it down. The bank counselled that he should wait to see if the market would recover. George realised after a few months that it had been a mistake to rely on the bank&rsquo;s advice and he closed the Kilkenny branch. He said that if he had closed the branch earlier he could have saved a lot of money. This was an important lesson to George: don&rsquo;t discuss strategy with banks. He felt it was bizarre that a bank would talk a customer into a decision that, potentially, could have brought down the whole business.</p>\r\n<p>George believes that the banks were not experienced enough in dealing with their own liquidity issues arising from the collapse in the Irish property bubble and the global financial crisis. The banks&rsquo; immediate and panicked response to the evolving situation was to demand their loans back, which created undue pressures on businesses who themselves were struggling to survive.</p>\r\n<p>However, George has since identified a number of experts in helping businesses and owners of distressed assets to communicate and to negotiate with the banks, particularly in the context of the new rules and regulations governing the financial services sector. These experts are skilled in:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>identifying the problems between borrowers and lenders;</li>\r\n<li>presenting the solution to lenders.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>His family were an important source of advice and support. However, his father was pre-occupied with his own financial difficulties and, additionally, the difficult transfer of the family business from father to son had fractured relationships. Perhaps because of these issues his father was not in a position to advise George.</p>\r\n<p>Though it was not directly intended as a support for SMEs within the motor retail industry going through a restructuring, the decision in 2010 by the Irish tax authorities, the Revenue Commissioners, to make adjustments to the VAT administration system helped dealers to reduce their VAT bill and thus improve their profitability and cash flow. Additionally, the government introduced a new scrappage scheme in 2010, allowing people to claim a rebate of up to &euro;1,500 for trading in their old car.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Despite having to cope with three empty buildings, all with significant mortgages, George was determined to press ahead with his new venture of selling second-hand cars from the UK via the internet. Virtual car sales, that is selling cars via a web site, was a brand new concept and, more importantly, did not eat cash.</p>\r\n<p>He and Brian had made a number of visits to the UK and had linked up with a UK consultant to open doors to large dealers who could provide them with second hand cars that they could sell via their new website.</p>\r\n<p>One of the many lessons that George had learnt was that the old business model &ndash; of selling cars in volume &ndash; was no longer going to be sustainable in Ireland in the short and medium-term future. He realised that a new business model, such as virtual car sales, was the way forward even though it might mean a smaller number of employees. His new online business, wesourcenecar.com, allows purchasers to choose the model, the make, the year, the specification, the mileage, the colour and, finally, the price. George or his brother Brian personally signed off on all cars purchased by customers.</p>\r\n<p>The negative outcome of the restructuring for the employees of the four companies controlled by George and his family was that they all lost their jobs. However, seven former employees have been recruited by George and his brother&rsquo;s new internet company, which in 2012 employs seven full-time and two part-time employees.</p>\r\n<p>It is understood that most of the Mordaunts&rsquo; other former employees have managed to find alternative employment and in many cases were assisted to do so with references provided by George Mordaunt.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>One of the issues that George Mordaunt had to grapple with during the restructuring process was communication with the banks. He had to deal with a situation where the banks were panicking because of the collapse in the property sector and their lack of access to wholesale funds. Their anxiety was manifested in their demand to George Mordaunt to return the loans they had provided to him and in delays in sanctioning new funding for the restructuring of the business.</p>\r\n<p>Finding experts to help businesses negotiate with the banks was very difficult but George Mordaunt has subsequently managed to identify two experts who were skilled in helping him and other borrowers in a similar position. Since the publication of his book, George has become an unofficial mentor to many SMEs who are in difficulties with their banks and his main advice to them is to get in touch with these experts. He explains to them that these experts are skilled in identifying how to present their case to the banks, and how to use their contacts within a bank to influence its key decision-makers.</p>\r\n<p>Surprisingly, George Mordaunt says the whole restructuring experience has been hugely beneficial to him. He asserts that he will never lose money again on a business venture (he will focus on his key business strengths and will put greater emphasis on digital social media, creativity and low overheads) and says the process has changed his perspective on life.</p>\r\n<p>He also predicts that, within the new business model of using the web to reach customers and keeping overheads down, staff will have to multi-task.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process &mdash; which resulted in 53 people losing their jobs &mdash; was traumatic for both the Mordaunts and the employees concerned. It is understood that the vast majority have now found alternative employment and some of these now work in the Mordaunts&rsquo; new virtual car sales company. Reference has been made to the fact that, in a small town such as Clonmel, news &mdash; good and bad &mdash; travels fast. While George Mordaunt had to deal with rumours regarding the fate of his business, employees too had to cope with a work environment in which rumours were circulating that they or a colleague were losing their jobs. Though George held group meetings throughout the restructuring process to keep employees abreast of the perilous situation facing the company, this was not enough to keep the rumours at bay. It is speculated that in a larger company with more structured HR processes, there might have been clearer communication processes between management and staff.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Tom Martin, Tom Martin &amp; Associates (TMA), Ireland.</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>Mordaunt, G., (2011) <em>Shepherd&rsquo;s Pie: Family Business, Recession and Recovery &mdash; The Real Story</em>, Mercier Press, Cork.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>George Mordaunt, wesourcenecars.com and formerly shareholder and director of BMS, Mordaunt Chevrolet, GBM and GBM Cityside</p>\r\n<p>Sara Power and Ciaran Hayes, employees of wesourcenecars.com and previously of Brian Mordaunt &amp; Sons Limited</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company address</strong></p>\r\n<p>Davis Road,</p>\r\n<p>Clonmel,</p>\r\n<p>Co.

"Camilleri Group of Companies, Malta"~"Camilleri Group of Companies"~"<p>Business expansion has always been a key strategy for Maltese import/export and retail family firm Camilleri. Each restructuring in this process is a lengthy process, requiring detailed planning, involving a formal business plan that sets out objectives and actions needed to reach them, as well as a financial assessment of the project. A project schedule is constantly monitored to ensure progress. All members of staff are informed of any restructuring activities that may affect them, a vital factor in ensuring the smooth running of the project. The group continues to experience growth in both turnover and employment.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The Camilleri Group of Companies operates in the import/export and retail of clothing and household goods; the import/retail and wholesale of confectionary products; and outside catering including fresh products for its confectionery retail outlets.</p>\r\n<p>Calcedonio Camilleri started the family business as C. Camilleri &amp; Sons in 1843 when he opened a small confectionary shop in the heart of Valletta. It did not take long before the shop started to attract customers from all corners of the island, whose visit to the capital city would include a stop at the popular sweet shop in Merchants Street. Consequently, the Camilleris have been nicknamed ‘Camilleri tal-Ħelu’ (Camilleri the sweet people). </p>\r\n<p>Since then, the company has been passed on to four successive generations of the Camilleri family. In 1980, the business was acquired by the current owners: Charles, Anthony, Joseph and André Camilleri. Charles acts as managing director of the company. Anthony, Joseph and André are also directors in the company and participate actively in the management of Camilleri Group. In 1981, C. Camilleri &amp; Sons became a Limited Liability Company.</p>\r\n<p>For many years, the Camilleri family was associated exclusively in Malta with the confectionary trade.<i> </i> Over the years however, the family-owned business diversified into outside catering, clothing, home furnishings and the mother-to-be and baby products sector. Together with its renowned confectionary outlet, this business has grown to the extent that it has become known as Camilleri Group of Companies which today owns the BHS, Mothercare and Golden Point franchises. It is also the pioneer for the popular Pick ‘n’ Mix sweets outlets and ice-cream parlours. </p>\r\n<p>In 2003, the company acquired the management of a reception venue. The following year, the catering division set up in 1983 was incorporated into the business as C. Camilleri &amp; Sons (Catering) Ltd. The catering division caters for all types of functions, receptions and parties at both the private and corporate level, and supplies its products to the company’s confectionery retail outlets. </p>\r\n<p>Up to 2002, the educational background of family members within the business was very traditional and business was conducted mainly through the valued experience passed on from generation to generation.</p>\r\n<p>The new fifth generation of family members have now started to integrate themselves into the Group. The younger generation all hold university degrees in business management.</p>\r\n<p>The Camilleri Group of Companies benefits from a long-standing history in the local market with a track record of achievement which has received considerable acclaim both in Malta and overseas.</p>\r\n<p>The Group comprises:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>C. Camilleri &amp; Sons Ltd. </li>\r\n<li>C. Camilleri &amp; Sons (Catering) Ltd.</li>\r\n<li>Camilleri Establishments Ltd.</li>\r\n<li>Camilleri Trading Ltd.</li>\r\n<li>Camilleri Trends Ltd.</li>\r\n<li>Camilleri Holdings Ltd.</li>\r\n<li>House of Fashion Ltd.</li>\r\n<li>Camilleri Import &amp; Export Ltd.</li>\r\n<li>World Vision Travelling Ltd. (50%)</li>\r\n<li>Treat &amp; Taste Ltd. (50%)</li>\r\n<li>Re-Store Ltd (50%).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All companies are 100% family-owned except where indicated. </p>\r\n<p>In 1988, Camilleri Establishments Ltd. was formed to act as a franchise for BHS. Another company bearing the name Camilleri Trading Ltd. was formed in 1997, to act as a franchise for Mothercare. The year 2000 saw the inception of Camilleri Holdings Ltd. which mainly acts as the holding company for all operations. In 2004, the company centralised all its operations in Tal-Handaq, Qormi. The catering division, which was set up in 1983, was separated from C. Camilleri &amp; Sons Ltd. in 2004 and renamed as C. Camilleri &amp; Sons (Catering) Ltd. House of Fashion Ltd. was formed in 2009 to deal with the BHS franchise in Libya. </p>\r\n<p>In 2009, Camilleri Trends Ltd. was formed to act as franchisee for GoldenPoint. Camilleri Import &amp; Export Ltd. was set up to take the responsibility for Prémaman in Libya. World Vision Travel Ltd., Treat &amp; Taste Ltd. and Re-Store Ltd. are all companies formed with third parties as joint ventures and Camilleri Group holds a 50% share in each. </p>\r\n<p>A total of 16 retail outlets were opened between 1988 and 2012 (12 in Malta and four in Libya); together with the flagship confectionary outlet, which is still in operation till today. </p>\r\n<p>The company has one director responsible for a particular brand and a brand manager and a deputy brand manager who is responsible for the running of the brand. Each shop has its own supervisors and shop assistants. Within this organisational set-up, everyone has his/her share of responsibility in the running of a particular brand.</p>\r\n<p>An equal proportion of the group’s sales output is generated between local and foreign customers. The company has a workforce of 115 full-time employees, of which 45 are male and 70 are female. </p>\r\n<p>The company has recently appointed a consultant to prepare a risk management report for the whole group. The objective of the report, which is tailored to meet EU policy standards, is to map out risks and uncertainties within the business environment and analyse how such factors could influence business performance. By identifying and proactively addressing risks and opportunities, the company will be better able to address its policies and strategies in favour of the employee by strengthening positive influences on the workforce. </p>\r\n<p>The human resource policies adopted by the company ensure that employees are well respected and motivated. Together with its young employees, the management boasts of having people who have been working with the company for almost 30 years, a reality which is considered to be a reflection of the good working practices adopted by the company.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>The Camilleris have been exposed to the business world since their early childhood and thus believe themselves to have an almost inherent predisposition for trading. </p>\r\n<p>Camilleri Group considers business expansion to be the best way forward for any business that is performing well and delivering sound results. In fact, business expansion has always featured as an integral process in the management of the group and came about initially from the desire to increase the company’s market share locally. Business expansion has also allowed the company to remain sustainable within a highly competitive market, securing employment for a growing number of employees which also includes family members who are now gradually taking over the management of the business. </p>\r\n<p>This said, the decision to extend its operations beyond the catering sector dates back to 1988, when a business opportunity presented itself to open the first BHS store in Valletta. Another two stores were later opened in Sliema (1993) and Birkirkara (2004). In 1997, having successfully managed the BHS franchise for almost a decade, Camilleri Group was appointed franchisee of Mothercare in Malta, with brands specialising in mothers-to-be and children’s products. Four outlets have been opened since – Valletta (1997), Sliema (2003), Birkirkara (2008) and recently Victoria Gozo (2011). </p>\r\n<p>As part of its most recent restructuring activities which is the focus of this study, Camilleri Group has continued to expand its business both locally and abroad. In 2009, Camilleri Group opened its first BHS store in Libya. It also inaugurated the first Golden Point store in the town of Sliema, with the latter specialising in hosiery, lingerie, beachwear and underwear brands. The idea to launch Golden Point in Malta was one based on the experience already gained through the operation of its BHS lingerie and sleepwear departments.</p>\r\n<p>In 2010, the group opened its second outlet in Tripoli, Libya for BHS. In 2011, another two sweet shops were opened in Birkirkara and Rabat, Malta. In the same year, the second Golden Point was opened in Valletta and Mothercare was launched in Gozo. </p>\r\n<p>Apart from the opening of its new stores, in 2008, Camilleri Group also carried out a complete refurbishment of its flagship sweet shop situated in Valletta; and in 2011, the company undertook the refurbishment of its BHS store in Sliema.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Business expansion has always occupied a strategic function within Camilleri Group’s development strategy. Over the years, the company’s reputation with the confectionary trade has evolved and extended to other areas such as the outside catering service, clothing, home furnishings and mother-to-be and baby products. </p>\r\n<p>Forecasting and planning for growth can be a challenge. The study that goes behind each and every project is a lengthy process which requires thoughtful and meticulous planning. Generally, the idea to tap into new business opportunities stems from management’s own extensive experience in the field of importation, retailing and catering business, together with its understanding of the local market. The company aims to maintain continuous strategic investment in activities that will help it become more competitive. </p>\r\n<p>Management considers the planning stage to be the most crucial phase within any project. As a first step, management would undertake an initial assessment of the potential of its anticipated investment within the context of the economic environment at the time and the consumers’ response to that activity. If the results are favourable, it would then proceed with carrying out the necessary consultations with key individuals from within the company who would need to be involved in the realisation of the project.</p>\r\n<p>Once the vision is set, management proceeds with setting out a formal business plan that clearly maps out the objectives to be pursued, and the actions needed to be taken in order to reach those objectives. The business plan would also include an assessment of the financial sustainability and profitability of the project. </p>\r\n<p>A decision is also taken with regard to the financing of the project. If company funds are insufficient then negotiations commence with the company’s bankers in order to secure a bank loan. Once negotiations are concluded and all legal requirements are satisfied (contracts/agreements), management proceeds with preparing a Gantt chart to map out the project schedule and work structure of the project. Project monitoring is consistent throughout the project to ensure both timing and quality.</p>\r\n<p>Although timeframes are key to project management, the so-called bargaining stages of the process are generally followed by a period of reflection and careful projection which does not necessarily take place within strict timeframes. Such projections would also involve the preparation of a feasibility study, together with discussions and consultations concerning management.</p>\r\n<p>The planning stage also provides a means to involve other personnel from within the company in the management of the project. Management emphasises the importance of ensuring that all members of staff are well informed and prepared in advance of any restructuring activities which may require either their direct support or which can influence their work indirectly. Involvement in planning also fosters a greater personal commitment to the plan and to the company. These positive attitudes are found to improve the overall organisational morale and enthusiasm within the company. </p>\r\n<p>Due to unforeseen events which may crop up during the restructuring process – such as changing market conditions – the company is sometimes confronted with the need to revise its plans as it goes along. Nevertheless, there have been instances where the company would decide to push forward with its plans, despite unfavourable conditions. For example, when the refurbishment of one of its leading brand stores was being carried out, management took into consideration the enduring credit crunch which had impacted largely on the economy at the time. It decided however to take advantage of this somewhat destructive reality and push forward with its works as planned, thereby obtaining a competitive advantage once the critical period was over.</p>\r\n<p>Partners and suppliers are informed of the company’s expansion plans on a need-to-know basis only. Where this is not the case, disclosure of business expansion plans are usually limited to the board of directors, management and consultants (when involved), together with the company’s bankers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Management did not encounter any major challenges or constraints which could have disrupted the restructuring process. The smooth manner in which restructuring is carried out is mainly attributed to the time invested in the planning and consultation stage which would ensure that all key players – both internal and external (including consultants, when involved) – are on board and committed to the successful delivery of the established targets once the implementation phase kicks in. </p>\r\n<p>Business expansion does, however, bring about a considerable increase in workload. The pressures that come with this are mainly taken on by the directors and managerial staff. In order to mitigate this situation, store managers are instructed to delegate parts of their work to other members of staff – resulting in a sharing of work responsibility – or to look into the recruitment of additional support. If the former approach is considered the preferred option, work is delegated to individuals that display the necessary abilities and skills to perform any new tasks effectively. This uptake of responsibility will effectively lead to a better remuneration package for the employee. </p>\r\n<p>Management emphasises the importance of ensuring that in-house operations are functioning smoothly prior to being able to assess the external impact of any project.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Business expansion requires thoughtful planning and research which would help determine market conditions and gauge consumer market response prior to moving forward with restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>All decisions concerning business expansion are taken by the board of directors, following consultation with the respective brand managers. Management believes, however, that given the investment which goes into such projects, it is advisable that external support be sought by economic and legal consultants who would be able to assess the financial and economic implications of the project and gauge the risks/benefits of the new venture.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Camilleri Group has always dealt with business expansion as a normal process within the evolution of the business. The management team at Camilleri Group looks positively on the outcome of the restructuring carried out to date and envisages business expansion as an integral part of its future business plans. </p>\r\n<p>The group has reportedly continued to register positive growth in turnover, which is the result of the continued investment injected into the company and into business expansion.</p>\r\n<p>Management claims that it has always sought ways in which to shelter its workforce from any adverse effects which may arise from restructuring. Having said this, business expansion has reportedly resulted in employment growth for the company. Since 2008, Camilleri Group has inaugurated over eight new shops both locally and abroad. Prior to the business expansion after 2008, the total number of full-time employees within the Group stood at 95. Today, the company has a total of 115 full-time workers.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier in the report, business expansion generally brings about an increase in workload which is duly alleviated through the distribution of work amongst employees and where necessary, the recruitment of additional staff. Both management and employees feel that restructuring activities instil a sense of motivation on the job and bring about an opportunity for the owners / management and staff to work together towards reaching the desired company goals. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The management at Camilleri Group feels that SMEs in Malta tend to garner less support than larger companies given that the latter represent a larger workforce. At the same time, the SME sector is also seen to be disadvantaged when it comes to EU funding opportunities which are largely targeted towards assisting micro enterprises employing less than ten employees.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, management claims that companies operating in the retail sector are also disadvantaged when compared with the manufacturing industry, which qualify for greater assistance when compared to retail operators. </p>\r\n<p>When it comes to financing, management claims that access to bank loans is less daunting for large companies given their financial projections. SMEs are allegedly faced with more bureaucratic and stringent procedures by bankers in comparison to large companies, which is allegedly due to the misconception that SMEs may not hold enough security for their loans.</p>\r\n<p>Management believes that in order to alleviate these disadvantages, SMEs operating in the retail industry should benefit, at the least, from tax-rebates on investments and employment, while efforts should be made to reduce bureaucracy and related excess costs.</p>\r\n<p>The success of Camilleri Group is largely attributed to its ability to anticipate and adapt to change, which is considered crucial if one intends to stay ahead in the business. Although it is considered important to invest in the planning of any restructuring project, management insists that once a decision is taken there should be no looking back and every effort should be made to implement those plans into a successful outcome for the company. </p>\r\n<p>Another crucial element within the restructuring process is that of keeping employees well informed of any development plans. Maintaining good communication channels with employees is a vital factor which helps to ensure the smooth implementation of a project. Employees may express different reactions to the restructuring project, depending on their different character types, however, management stresses that, in the end, reason prevails and employees are able to see that such decisions are taken in the interest of all parties. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Claudine Borg, Europa Research and Consultancy Services Ltd., Malta</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Charles Camilleri, Managing Director</p>\r\n<p>Administration and Finance Officer</p>\r\n<p><b>Company address</b></p>\r\n<p>Camilleri Holdings Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>13-20 Manoel Borg Gauci Street,</p>\r\n<p>Qormi,</p>\r\n<p>Malta</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.camillerigroup.com"">www.camillerigroup.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Malta"~"47 - retail trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"business expansion"~"2012-04-10"
"Company AS, Romania"~"AS"~"<p>Set up in 1997, Company AS operates in the film and advertising production business in Romania. The current owner acquired a loan to buy out the company in 2008 but this coincided with the economic slowdown. Due to delays in payments, fewer new contracts and competition from neighbouring countries, the company had to cut temporary contracts, outsource half the post-production jobs and look for alternative financing from other banks. In 2011, the company was again able to expand, stop outsourcing jobs and increase the workforce from 40 to 50.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Company AS is involved in the film and advertising production business. Currently it has only one shareholder, Mr G.  The company does not have a works council. Many of the clients are from overseas (40%), and the rest are from Romania. Also, some of the production is done in Romania but, since 2009, more and more is done in locations outside the country, for example South Africa. </p>\r\n<p>The company scouts locations and hires extras, prepares and organises the shootings of the film or commercial and then does post-production filming and editing. In 2011 it also began to offer vision effects and 3D animation. </p>\r\n<p>The owner is Mr G, who has been in this business for almost 20 years, starting on the sales side. The company was established in 1997. In 2008, when Mr G’s partner wanted to sell his shares, Mr G borrowed the money from a bank to buy them, and thus became the sole owner of the company. </p>\r\n<p>Company AS is a privately owned company, and in December 2011 employed 50 people. Part-time help is hired during filming. On these days catering and security companies are also hired. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The Romanian economy was dealt a tough blow in 1990. The shock of liberalising prices, and attempts to introduce market practices after the 1989 revolution, pushed the economy into recession. The first private TV station, PRO TV, appeared in 1995. About the same time, the local TV advertising industry was starting to take off. </p>\r\n<p>In the beginning, Mr G and his partner were just using commercials shot outside Romania and dubbed them into Romanian. At the same time they were able to win a few accounts for the post-production of films and commercials shot outside Romania. </p>\r\n<p>Around 2000 the company upgraded its equipment and expanded its area of services with the most important being the production of foreign films in Romania. The company has expanded, hired people (up to 40) and built new offices. </p>\r\n<p>In 2008 Mr G’s partner wanted to exit the company and Mr G had to take out a substantial loan in order to buy his part of the shares. The following year the global crisis hit Romania. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The acquisition of the loan coincided unfortunately with the global economic slowdown. Payments for the company’s services were delayed and there were fewer new contracts. At the same time competition from neighbouring countries exacerbated the situation, as companies there dramatically decreased their prices. </p>\r\n<p>In this environment it was not surprising that the cash position of Company AS deteriorated, and this led to the bank downgrading the company’s credit score, and asking Mr G to repay the entire amount of the loan.</p>\r\n<p>Faced with this difficulty, Mr G chose two paths to solve the problem. The first was internal restructuring and the second was looking for alternative financing solutions. As he had never done this before he did not have a well laid out plan, or a time frame. He looked to solve the problem one step at a time and he leaned towards solutions that would relieve some of the immediate cash flow problems. As restructuring would take some time he used most of his efforts to find short-term financing. </p>\r\n<p>Regarding the internal restructuring, Mr G first informed employees one month in advance about his decision not to renew four temporary contracts for the production team. At the same time he temporarily outsourced half the post-production jobs which would otherwise have required investment in new equipment.The outsourcing was done by contracting some of the post production process to the only other company in the market doing similar work. This was the first time the two competitors shared a working relationship. He did not have to get rid of any of the other workers as he outsourced the post-production part of the business which could be done more efficiently by another company. The remaining part of the post production process was done by his team. </p>\r\n<p>On the second front, Mr G asked for financing offers from a few different banks in an attempt to retain the amount of credit, while lowering the cost. As Company AS is an SME, and it was this particular sector that got hit the most during the 2009–2010 crisis, negotiating a new deal with a different bank was not easy. More specifically, it was easy to get their attention but the terms and conditions they offered were worse than those offered by his original bank. However, he did get offers from three other banks and started advanced negotiations with just one of them. </p>\r\n<p>With the cash problem solved, Mr G could return to his previous plans of expansion. He was able, in 2011, to acquire the equipment needed for post-production and thus stopped outsourcing his business to his competitors. Also, he was able to increase the number of employees from 40 to 50. </p>\r\n<p>The internal restructuring process lasted 18 months.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenge for Mr G was finding new financing to replace his previous credit line. His bank, under pressure from its headquarters, was continuously decreasing the amount available. Under those conditions Mr G was finding it difficult to pay for his monthly costs, such as bank loans, salaries, utilities, rent, production and maintenance. </p>\r\n<p>The other major challenge was due to a surprising turn of events in the market for film production and advertising. All of a sudden there was a need for 3D production and there was increased demand for advertising production from outside Romania. However, Mr G could not immediately respond as he was still dealing with the financing issue. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>After waiting for few weeks Mr G received a few financing offers from different banks. He asked the help of a former bank employee, a family friend, to identify the best terms. At the same time he told his bank that he was thinking of changing banks. This forced it to offer new loan conditions. </p>\r\n<p>With the help of the family friend, Mr G was able to choose between offers from a new bank and one from his current bank. He chose to stay with the current bank but with better terms; he was also able to keep the original amount of his credit line. </p>\r\n<p>Mr G has followed the advice of the family friend on cutting costs first. They first cut the easiest one, temporary contracts, and then looked at other flexible parts of the business (for example, the part of the post-production that could be outsourced). He also he left the renegotiation of the loan terms to the end in order to reduce this interest cost to his business. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Company AS has always been a successful company. It grew organically into a leader in post-production for films and commercials but also lately film and commercial productions. </p>\r\n<p>Throughout 2010, it had to deal with a cash flow problem which was finally resolved. With this out of the way Mr G was able to invest more and expand the business in 2011. It increased the number of employees from 40 to 50. Also, the overall turnover increased by 12%. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>It is interesting to note that Mr G, like most entrepreneurs in Romania, was taken by surprise by the current economic crisis. The reaction to the slowdown in demand for his services was unsurprising, as he turned first towards the easiest costs to cut. As he did this without outside help it shows that, for small companies, managers/owners react naturally to adverse shocks and they look at minimising costs first. One other aspect to mention is that Mr G was able very quickly to switch his focus to growing the business as soon as the cash flow problem was solved. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Florin Citu, GEA Strategy and Consulting</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Mr G, owner and manager of Company AS</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Romania"~"59 - motion picture, video and television programme production, sound recording and music publishing activities"~"10-49"~"50-249"~NULL~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2011-12-14"
"Cordovan Group, Sweden"~"Cordovan"~"<p>In the restructuring of the Swedish company Cordovan Group AB the board created a management team of 12 employees, who cancelled the initial strategic plan and then developed an alternative pathway.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Cordovan Group AB is a communication and consultancy company with experts in public relations, advertising, design and web-strategists, psychologists, business developers and management consultants. Its clients consist of large global corporations as well as small local businesses and start-ups.</p>\r\n<p>The company was founded in 1983 under the name Adera. In the beginning, the company carried out public relations management for large industrial companies. However, as the industrial companies did not need much publicity, it developed its business idea into a communications consultancy agency. The company was launched on the Stockholm stock exchange in 1995. Of course, it was difficult to compete with already established firms though the aim was to use the comparative advantages within the company and create something new. The customers for the firm&rsquo;s public relations management work have always been large industrial companies.</p>\r\n<p>During the 1980s, the company had branches and offices in different places in Europe. The reason for this was to be able to give services to the customers at different locations. The idea was to work with international segments instead of administering everything from Sweden. The recession in the early 1990s impacted greatly on the company leading to several problems. The company decided to introduce more tools in IT for their customers in order to provide better IT solutions.</p>\r\n<p>Since the burst of the dot-com bubble at the beginning of 2000, it has been increasingly hard to sustain profitability. In 2000 the company had over 700 employees. After the peak in 2001&ndash;2002 the company struggled to survive, and consequently both turnover and employment declined. Because of this the firm was forced to sell parts of the business, including its offices in Europe. Nevertheless, its main customers stayed with the company and in 2004 the firm decided to &lsquo;start-over&rsquo; and renew its business, with a new name &ndash; Cordovan, also organised as public limited company.</p>\r\n<p>The core division of the company is situated in Gothenburg. The company is divided into three parts, forming the company group. The first one is <em>Chamber Business Network</em> (CBN), which is a meeting place/venue for corporate leaders of listed companies where HR managers, CEOs and communication managers meet in groups of eight to ten people to discuss different issues. For instance, they can use this platform to discuss how to navigate foreign arenas, looking for possible business partners and share working strategies to enter new markets, for example, the African market. The purpose is to develop and strengthen leadership abilities within small and medium sized enterprises.</p>\r\n<p>The second part of the company is <em>Cordovan Performance</em>. This part works more with organisational development, how to get employees in companies involved and understand the vision of their company. Performance assists companies in developing the trademark from the inside out, from employee to customer.</p>\r\n<p>The third part is <em>Cordovan Communications</em>. This is the largest branch of the company and consists of consultants in communication. Web strategy, advertising and system-building for companies are their main services.</p>\r\n<p>Today about 75 people are employed at Cordovan and their average age is 35. The Performance group has seven senior consultants employed full-time and within this group the majority of employees have an academic background. Cordovan Communications has fewer academics and the average age is closer to 30. Some employees have several degrees while others are self-taught. Previously, the company employed workers for their attitude and skill-level without demanding an academic background. However, recently Cordovan acquired a smaller company with employees who generally have a less academic background. This might cause a lack of innovation capacity and the firm therefore is thinking about perhaps demanding higher educational attainment from future employees.</p>\r\n<p>Today, Cordovan has no offices abroad although almost everything it does is directed towards the international market. Cordovan&rsquo;s customers have their offices and headquarters in Gothenburg though almost none of Cordovan&rsquo;s services are targeted at the Swedish market.</p>\r\n<p>There is no written strategy for Human Resources or Corporate Social Responsibility, although Cordovan assists other companies with writing their own policies and strategies in this area. Cordovan is not connected to any works council; however about 75 % of employees are trade union members.</p>\r\n<p>Rolf Jansson is the retiring chief executive officer of Cordovan Group AB, a company founder, and has a degree in business administration. He was chief executive officer of Cordovan Group AB when the restructuring event took place. Today there is a new executive board in the company and Mr Jansson&rsquo;s position is chief executive officer within the Cordovan Performance branch where he is a consultant. His position change is not a consequence of the restructuring event, rather it is due to a generation shift.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring event took place during 2010&ndash;2011 and consisted of an internal restructuring whereby 15 employees were given notice.</p>\r\n<p>During 2010, plans were made on which paths to take and which ideas to invest in. One important question was whether or not Cordovan would acquire another company about to go bankrupt, Jerlov. One central group within Cordovan during this period was working on digital solutions for customers, Cordovan Digital. It was strongly opposed to the acquisition so when the board decided to acquire Jerlov 20 of the 40 employees in Cordovan Digital group decided to leave, taking their customers with them to start a business of their own. They were upset because the board took the decision, despite knowing these key employees had been against the decision from the beginning. As a consequence, Cordovan lost employees, clients and competence. The board said it decided to acquire the other company because it felt the other company would complement Cordovan as it had much experience within social media and access to different networks, therefore opening up the possibility of finding new clients together.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The trigger for the restructuring event (the Cordovan Digital group leaving the company) took place in March 2010. For about nine months afterwards the company tried to regain its strength, trying to make up for the lost competence and clients. The idea of solving the problem by giving notice to a few employees was difficult to carry out quickly because of contractual arrangements. At the end of November, the decision was made after serious talks with the company accountant concerning the 2010 statement for accounts. In January 2011, 15 employees were given notice following a meeting where the announcement was made.</p>\r\n<p>One incentive for restructuring was to show clients that Cordovan would be back in business and start afresh in 2011. For big clients the process was very transparent and they knew about the restructuring before it took place. At times the clients were even informed before the employees. Since the company is official and its customers demand openness from it, Cordovan issued a press release concerning the restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>The actors involved in the decision were the members of the Cordovan board. They created a management team with 12 employees to work on finding a strategy. The idea to freeze wages was cancelled and instead the decision to dismiss 15 consultants emerged. The reason for giving notice instead of freezing wages was, according to Rolf Jansson, that the workers given notice were talented and would soon be offered new jobs; therefore, it would be a better solution for everyone to let them go.</p>\r\n<p>During the process some adjustments were made. One employee chose to leave in addition to the 15 who had been given notice. Some of the 15 people concerned took voluntary retirement (that is, some of the workers close to retirement volunteered to be the ones to be given notice) and the rest were asked to leave.</p>\r\n<p>For the workers the restructuring was difficult. No one knew whether or not they would still have jobs in the morning according to Rolf Jansson. Loyalty made them stay under uncertain circumstances. This uncertainty was present up until the decision to restructure the company was made. There was no shortening of working hours, rather the opposite. For a time, everyone worked more, except two women who volunteered to work part time (60% and 70%, respectively). The employees given notice left the company right away after the decision was taken and, according to Mr Jansson, all employees were very satisfied with the final decision to remove 15 employees. This created a more secure work environment for the remaining employees. The company gave no direct support to those leaving except to tell others in the business that skilled labour from Cordovan was looking for employment and also to inform its former employees if it saw any openings at other businesses.</p>\r\n<p>The Jerlov CEO, the company Cordovan had recently acquired, left Cordovan as a part of the restructuring event due to her lack of insight in the business and client contact according to Rolf Jansson. Also, it sent a signal to employees that jobs were being cut at every level, including management.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>One challenge was to find a solution to retain the younger workers. These workers had key competences, though they had less experience working for the company. The company had to follow Swedish law on employment security (<em>Lagen om anst&auml;llningsskydd)</em> which ensures that long-service employees cannot be dismissed before those who have been working for a shorter period. Cordovan avoided parts of this rule by dividing the company into different teams. It used the team classification strategy in order to clarify the skills within the company and to create a separate rotation list which defined who was next in line to leave the company in case of scarcity of work. This was linked to clearer role descriptions and made it easier to keep the employees the firm wanted to keep. The teams were &lsquo;interactive&rsquo;, &lsquo;creative&rsquo; and &lsquo;PR and social media&rsquo;, where younger employees were placed, while the team &lsquo;graphical production&rsquo; included older employees. During the restructuring most people given notice were employed within the &lsquo;graphical production&rsquo; team. This raised voices from older staff who believed this action was taken to dismiss specific people for personal reasons and let others stay.</p>\r\n<p>The company brought in a lawyer to define the roles within Cordovan and see how the restructuring would be performed legally. The lawyer made sure the actions taken were legitimate. However, some employees had a different opinion about this, and called their trade union for advice. The plan was explained and employees who were affected got the chance to be involved and share their thoughts and ideas concerning the restructuring. Two employees were very dissatisfied with the restructuring and hired lawyers to help them solve the situation. They questioned whether or not Cordovan had avoided Swedish law on employment security. Cordovan had to grant a settlement with the employees who hired lawyers to solve this disagreement. These two employees were given twelve months payment plus payment for the time it took to settle this.</p>\r\n<p>After the acquisition, the loss of 20 employees and the internal restructuring, Cordovan felt it was lacking a clear plan for the company. The management team of 12 were given the mission to map the organisation&rsquo;s competences. They had to create a specific strategy in order to deal with the restructuring. They divided themselves into teams to handle the restructuring process. The organisation became clearer and they had discussions on, &lsquo;What do we want to become?&rsquo; and, &lsquo;How will we get there?&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>During this period of uncertainty, the shareholders, among them Rolf Jansson, were not able to sell their stocks easily. This created the need to dilute the stocks in order to finance restructuring expenses (such as severance payments and legal fees) and therefore Rolf Jansson&rsquo;s stocks became less valuable. Rolf Jansson concludes that perhaps he could have become wealthier by selling his shares sooner or investing differently though he says it has been an interesting and challenging journey and fortunately he has been able to keep his job.</p>\r\n<p>Another challenge during restructuring is how to keep the competence within a company without going against any regulations. The advantage for SMEs in Sweden, according to Mr Jansson, is that SMEs can more easily navigate around the Swedish law concerning employment security by using different solutions that aren&rsquo;t possible in large companies. In large companies one has to think more carefully before hiring anyone, while SMEs can be slightly more flexible. If Cordovan had had one trade union negotiating for all employees, it might have thought twice before employing.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company used advice from a lawyer during the restructuring in order to ensure that the process was legitimate. However, in Cordovan there has never been any question of looking for any kind of financial or other support from actors other than the company itself, its clients or risk capitalists. The reasoning is this: if the company does not have enough customers to provide work and sufficient turnover it should not exist. A company like Cordovan is driven by competition and should live from its comparative advantages, and not be dependent upon financial support from the government, says Rolf Jansson.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Cordovan Digital left the company and this triggered the restructuring, although these employees have now been replaced. During the restructuring a few left voluntarily since they were offered new jobs. None of the older employees about to retire within a few years accepted early retirement since they wanted to keep working for the company until retirement age. The employees that were given notice were offered the chance to freelance from their old desks, partly as compensation for making them unemployed. A few of them are still making use of this opportunity today.</p>\r\n<p>Rolf Jansson concludes that a few mistakes were made. Some competence was lost during restructuring. Before the restructuring the working process within the company was not as clear as it was to become later. Afterwards, a few employees were replaced with more suitable employees. Up to May 2012, Cordovan had to pay salaries to some employees given notice. To do this, the company has had to dilute its stock capital in order to survive.</p>\r\n<p>After Cordovan Digital left the group there was no money left to finance the costs of managing the merger with the other company. The acquired company, Jerlov, had no money since it was on the edge of bankruptcy. As a consequence, Cordovan had to deal with all the expenses themselves. Also the chief executive officer who left the company wished to sell her shares in the company. The company brought in many investors who could invest and they had to dilute their shares on the stock market. Today Cordovan is 50% owned by a risk capitalist.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring caused a delay in the company&rsquo;s orders. Cordovan had difficulties performing its consultancy work within the time demanded by clients. Large clients have large demands and if Cordovan had lost a few large clients this could have jeopardised the entire business. It was also difficult since it had won a few large procurements which it struggled to complete on time.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the Cordovan reputation became tarnished since it had difficulties in paying suppliers. Some suppliers turned to Cordovan&rsquo;s clients to share their dissatisfaction with the company. This was one of the motives for the restructuring: employees and clients understood that the situation wasn&rsquo;t sustainable.</p>\r\n<p>Today the clientele is stable. Cordovan works with employees and managers that want to be part of the company. The harmony within the company is different today according to Mr Jansson. It is better off after the crisis than before and the workers seem more motivated today when everything is working. One outcome of the restructuring was the four teams mentioned: &lsquo;interactive&rsquo;, &lsquo;creative&rsquo;, &lsquo;PR and social media&rsquo;, and &lsquo;graphical production&rsquo;. After the restructuring event, most employees and the board concluded that the division into these teams has made the roles within the company clearer.</p>\r\n<p>Further outcomes from the restructuring are that there have been plans to introduce a bonus system in order to increase employee loyalty. All the firm&rsquo;s employees are very competent and could start their own businesses to compete with Cordovan if they wanted to. They would also have some advantage with clients, since client-relationships are personal. Some employees have expressed a wish to start their own business and invited Rolf Jansson to join them. This bonus system has therefore been discussed to give incentives to stay with the company. The company has previously also offered shares to key employees to convince them to stay.</p>\r\n<p>One recommendation is to create a management group that will stand behind the decisions. In Cordovan&rsquo;s case, its management group was too large and should have been smaller and stricter. It consisted of 12 people which made it difficult to hold anyone accountable for the actions taken. Mr Jansson concludes that four or five people would make a more effective team in both handling this sort of process and in being held responsible. The reason Cordovan decided to have 12 was because it had just acquired a new company and roles weren&rsquo;t clear yet.</p>\r\n<p>Rolf Jansson still has contact with the Cordovan Digital employees who left the company, triggering the restructuring. He has a meeting scheduled with them soon and there are no hard feelings between them, according to Mr Jansson.</p>\r\n<h4>Outcome of restructuring according to an employee</h4>\r\n<p>Rolf Stridh has worked for Cordovan since 2006 when the company he worked for merged with Cordovan Group AB. He is a 55-year-old copywriter and has experience of working in small companies with five to six employees but also in larger companies with 90 employees. Mr Stridh wasn&rsquo;t personally affected by the redundancies. He is a senior in the company and therefore felt safe in his position. However, during the restructuring planning, Rolf Stridh was part of the management group at Cordovan. This meant he was one of the 12 responsible for planning the changes within the business. Within this group he was involved in evaluating employee competence and length of service in order to decide which employees would be asked to leave. This was difficult and stressful and the atmosphere in the company became affected by this.</p>\r\n<p>The company has been built on a number of mergers and acquisitions with other companies in the business and has grown with every merger. This has created a structure where the company has not been so careful with checking which competences already exist within the company and which competences should be recruited. The restructuring event has led to the insight that this is not the best way to build the business. According to Mr Stridh, perhaps the restructuring can be seen as a positive thing for the organisation of the work crew. The restructuring made the firm evaluate which workers were the key individuals within the company, although on an individual level the restructuring did not benefit anyone, he says.</p>\r\n<p>The employees connected to a trade union always had a representative present during the restructuring negotiations. This representative made sure nothing inappropriate was done that would affect the workers in a way that could be prevented. While the situation was very tough, according to Rolf Stridh employees felt that the situation was handled correctly. Of course, employees felt angry and disappointed though they didn&rsquo;t feel inappropriately treated. The trade union representatives involved made sure above all that the priority rules were respected when deciding which employees to let go. One employee got advice from his union that if he were given notice this would be wrong, according to the priority rules. Therefore, he got to stay. Though this was the only exception, according to Mr Stridh, since the firm hired a lawyer to ensure the right actions were taken.</p>\r\n<p>There have been no specific actions taken to support the affected employees although business networking might identify job vacancies in other companies in order to help them.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring has improved the firm in general, according to Rolf Stridh. The economy is stable and the working atmosphere is positive. Unfortunately, however, searching for the company on the internet produces links to local newspaper articles on the redundancy notices as one of the top search results. This affects the clients&rsquo; image of the company and reminds employees of the hard times they experienced, even though two years has passed since the event.</p>\r\n<p>Rolf Stridh emphasises the importance of creating a company culture where the most important values are developed and shared between all employees in order to be able to handle this kind of situation. In times of uncertainty, there are always procedures that can be improved, although the restructuring was probably inevitable. In future, it may be possible to be more aware and prevent a situation like this from emerging so fast without having control over it. Many in the management group were surprised by the situation when it happened and perhaps they could have been better prepared for it. In Mr Stridh&rsquo;s opinion, for businesses such as Cordovan, it is not size that matters concerning whether or not a company can plan and implement restructuring events. In the communication and public relations business where Cordovan is active there are rarely any formal contracts with clients. This creates an insecure environment where situations can change fast regardless of company size.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>In highly skilled service industries, employees usually have a high competence level which makes them quite independent of the company where they work. Therefore, managers in such enterprises need, to a greater extent, to be aware of this condition and prevent competent labour leaving the company. This situation can be contrasted with the manufacturing industry where workers are generally less flexible and more dependent on their workplace.</p>\r\n<p>In Sweden, the legal implications also create challenges for many SMEs facing restructuring with job cuts as a consequence. Swedish law concerning employment security (<em>Lagen om anst&auml;llningsskydd</em>) is supposed to ensure long-service employees that they can&rsquo;t be dismissed before those employed for a shorter period. This creates challenges for SMEs with a small workforce where obeying the &lsquo;last in first out&rsquo; system laid down by law means that a few workers with vital competence can&rsquo;t be given preferment. . In SMEs the loss of one important employee can really affect the business in a negative way, much more than in larger companies. In Cordovan&rsquo;s case it was able to get around this rule. It seems to be easier for SMEs to navigate around the system since they can be more flexible and more ad hoc solutions can be formed than is possible in larger companies.</p>\r\n<p>The main differences between restructuring in SMEs compared with large companies is, according to Rolf Jansson, that in large companies a lot more people are affected by a restructuring event. The chief executive officer for such a company has a greater responsibility for many families and it is probably not easy for large companies to make this kind of decision. Also, large companies are often listed on the stock exchange and when they decide to give notice to employees, the stocks usually go up and the restructuring is cheered even though it has caused difficulties for many families. It is different in an SME where the contact is much more personal concerning redundancy. Many affected employees take out their aggression against the board in SMEs. However, MrJansson concludes that in his position as a chief executive officer during the restructuring event he hasn&rsquo;t suffered a great deal because the employees given notice are very talented and will soon be back on track.</p>\r\n<p>One disadvantage for SMEs is that large companies are connected with trade unions that negotiate the conditions for everyone. Cordovan had to negotiate the dismissals on an individual level with different trade unions which made the process less open.</p>\r\n<p>Another difference between the highly skilled service sector and the manufacturing sector is that public support seems to be irrelevant. If a highly skilled service company cannot compete with their comparative advantages, it has failed with its services and public support is something that would distort the market economy for this industry. In comparison, the general idea in manufacturing industry seems to be more support-oriented. When demand is low, public support appears to be regarded as relevant and sometimes necessary in order to stimulate the business and to make it survive.</p>\r\n<p>The main lesson Cordovan has learnt is that it should have done everything faster and sooner instead of waiting and drawing out the process. Other experiences, shared by Rolf Jansson, is that the company Cordovan acquired, which spurred the internal disagreement within Cordovan, tried to save itself by getting more clients instead of going through a restructuring. This made it almost bankrupt and if it had not been acquired by Cordovan it would have had to close. So this case shows that restructuring can save jobs by cutting jobs, an important lesson to learn as a company.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Jan Persson and Ingrid Broman, Oxford Research</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>Rolf Jansson, chief executive officer, Cordovan</p>\r\n<p>Rolf Stridh, copywriter, Cordovan</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company address</strong></p>\r\n<p>Cordovan</p>\r\n<p>Kungstorget 7</p>\r\n<p>411 17 G&ouml;teborg</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company website</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.cordovan.se/"">http://www.cordovan.se/</a></p>"~"Sweden"~"73 - advertising and market research"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2012-02-17"
"EMS Technical Personnel, United Kingdom"~"EMS Technical Personnel Ltd"~"<p>This company is a recruitment services provider for the broadcast engineering sector. Previously, as a systems integrator, it employed technical personnel, but fluctuations in business persuaded management to diversify into recruitment services; otherwise, the company ran the risk of closing. Initially combining the two functions, EMS decided that the profile of the company was insufficiently clear and hence specialised solely in recruitment. It was important that this sole focus on recruitment be clearly communicated to prospective clients. Given that the directors had engineering backgrounds but lacked business management experience, an external business consultant was hired to guide the transition.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>EMS Technical Personnel Limited is a specialised recruitment services provider for the broadcast engineering sector. The company places contract and permanent engineers with client broadcasting companies, including Sky, BBC, and ITV, mainly in the UK, but occasionally abroad to broadcasters in Scandinavia, Asia, the middle East, and Ireland. </p>\r\n<p>The company, based in London, started in 1993, as EMS Limited (Electronic Media Systems), providing engineering services as a systems integrator. This involved the design and building of television facilities for large broadcasters. In 1998, the owners decided to diversify into recruitment and EMS Technical Personnel Limited was set up, as a separate company, to supply broadcast engineers, programme and project managers, and maintenance staff to the industry. The two companies ran in tandem until 2007 when a decision was made to close EMS Limited. </p>\r\n<p>EMS Technical Personnel has two owners. Dermot Casey is the major shareholder and managing director of the company. The second owner is a part-time business development director who is semi-retired and not involved in decision-making. Initially, EMS Ltd had four business owners/directors. When one director retired, Mr Casey acquired the shares. Moreover, when the recruitment service was introduced, the technical director decided to leave the business. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Casey began his career as an engineering apprentice. After taking his college exams, he worked as a draughtsman. Being a contractor was the most profitable way of working and so Mr Casey became a contractor through an agency. He learned how the agency worked in practice, organising contracts and getting a fee from placing contractors, an experience that has influenced his future business. In 1986, Mr Casey was offered a position with ITN, a UK broadcaster, as head of the drawing office where he worked for eight years before leaving to set up EMS with three ITN colleagues. </p>\r\n<p>EMS Technical Personnel employs six permanent office staff, including the two directors, an office manager, a senior recruiter, and two recruitment consultants. Additionally, it is able to draw on a large pool of engineers and professionals in the industry to work on a contract basis or to be placed permanently with clients. The company has grown rapidly from 45 contract staff in 2009 to 140 by 2012. Most workers have experience of working in broadcasting. </p>\r\n<p>The company follows a written set of ethical values, or a philosophy, when doing business. Its staff handbook provides general company information, including its vision and values, the equal opportunities policy, company rules and regulations, policy and procedures, and benefits. The company used external business advice to implement this. </p>\r\n<p>EMS Technical Personnel does not have any relationships with trade unions, nor an existing works council. It is, however, a member of the Association of Professional Staffing Companies (APSCo); the Association offers training programmes for its members which was utilised when one employee attended its weekly course in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>As a systems integrator, EMS Ltd tendered for work and employed engineers, programme and project managers to carry out the work. The nature of its work was to set up a facility to build and design infrastructure for a new television station. This operated successfully for a number of years; however, a new broadcast facility is required only every five to ten years. </p>\r\n<p>The business went through peaks and troughs and eventually looked into diversifying. The decision to diversify into recruitment was instigated by the managing director who had been considering the idea for years ever since working for an agency as a draughtsman. It was clear to the managing director that clients are not busy at all times and require greater flexibility over resources. A client may want to staff-up or staff-down, depending on how busy it is. The managing director realised that, by operating as a recruitment agency, EMS could fill that gap for the clients. </p>\r\n<p>When EMS Technical Personnel was set up in 1998, recruitment was seen as only one part of the business but subsequently it started to grow and employ more people. In 2007, while the company made profits of over £200,000 (approximately €250,000) from recruitment, the systems integration business made a loss of over £300,000 (approximately €380,000). In addition to this, running systems integration and recruitment at the same time was confusing its clients; it needed to send a clear message out to the industry to present themselves as a recruitment firm.  </p>\r\n<p>The case study describes the decline and closure of EMS Ltd, the growth of EMS Technical Personnel, and the changes to employment associated with the event. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In 2006, the systems integration side saw a downturn in business and the company had to reduce its permanent staff numbers. This resulted in two people retiring, including one director/owner of the business, and four people being made redundant. This left seven permanent employees, including three owner/directors with equal shares. </p>\r\n<p>By 2007, EMS Technical Personnel Ltd had grown steadily to be a successful small company and it became obvious that this was the way forward from a business perspective. This coincided with a further downturn in systems work. </p>\r\n<p>Staff could see that work was not coming in on the systems side and were informed of this fact. The directors explained that the business was not viable and could not continue running sustainably for very long. The directors had not taken a salary for three or four months and staff understood that the company would go under if there were no cut backs. </p>\r\n<p>The decision was made to focus on recruitment, which resulted in one of the three owners leaving.  The remaining six employees were given the choice of joining the recruitment side or carry on with the dwindling systems work. </p>\r\n<p>This resulted in a team of four, including two owner directors, working on recruitment for EMS Technical Personnel Ltd and two employees on the systems side. As this work dried up, one person found a position at different company through EMS Technical Personnel while the other one joined the recruitment team. At this point, in October 2008, EMS Ltd was closed. The company did not have a restructuring plan.  </p>\r\n<p>The remaining staff were happy with the changes and as the business grew they gained a new sense of achievement in working for a successful company. </p>\r\n<p>At the same time, the company hired a new senior recruitment consultant who concentrates on the recruitment of permanent staff. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The company faced a number of challenges prior to and following the restructuring events. One major challenge was that while the owner directors all had engineering backgrounds and a passion for engineering, they had little experience of business management. Being the only business-minded person in the company, Mr Casey’s proposal to diversify company services into recruitment in order to survive met with some resistance as the others wanted to carry on doing engineering work. However the bottom line was that the engineering systems business was no longer profitable and so Mr Casey’s proposal prevailed. Since then, two of the original owners have left the company, but Mr Casey did not report any challenges or constraints experienced during the closure of EMS Ltd.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company did not seek any business advice or support during the restructuring but as the recruitment business started to grow, Mr Casey felt that it would be difficult for someone with little experience to move forward without having the business basics in place. The company started to use the services of a business consultant on a regular basis. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Casey met a business consultant at a seminar organised by the Royal Bank of Scotland at the end of 2009. He decided to use his services for three months but subsequently extended his involvement in EMS. The consultant comes in once a month to advise on planning and all aspects of business. This has so far proved very successful. </p>\r\n<p>The business consultant identified what is important to the company and put actions in place to enable EMS to achieve its aims. The consultant suggested the invoice finance facility as well as outsourcing the back office work in order that the company could focus on core activities. Implementing these actions costs the company a lot of money as these practices are costly to maintain, but they allow EMS to concentrate on what it does best. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The decline of the systems integration work, the decision to focus fully on recruitment, and the closure of EMS Ltd had several employment effects. Four employees were made redundant and one of the three owners decided to leave the company. The remaining six employees, including two owners, were given the choice to join the recruitment side or continue with the declining systems integration work. Two employees continued with systems integration, but as all work dried up one of them joined the recruitment side and the other one got a position through the recruitment business. With the remaining five staff, Technical Personnel Ltd hired a new recruitment consultant reflecting its focus on recruitment services. </p>\r\n<p>The management took a number of actions as a result of internal reorganisation within the company, the closure of EMS Ltd, and the increased focus on recruitment. This included changes to premises, financing and work organisation. In 2009, the company moved into a smaller office to reflect the smaller, permanently employed workforce. It decided to change its bank and to implement an invoice finance facility. This costs ann annual fee of £20,000 (approximately €26,000), plus a charge of 2% above base rate for sums drawn down on the facility, so it is expensive but vital. All contractors now submit a time sheet every week and EMS pays them whilst invoicing the client. Because clients can take 30–60 days to pay, invoice finance provides the funds to pay salaries on time every week. Moreover, payments to contractors have been outsourced to another company. Having all these back office facilities in place allowed EMS to focus on recruitment and the expansion of the business from a turnover of £3.5 million (approximately €4.5 million) in 2009 to a projected turnover of £8.5 million (approximately €11 million) in 2012. </p>\r\n<p>In 2010, the company focused more on the promotion of recruitment services. Previously, it was sending out mixed messages. People in the industry knew EMS as a system integrator and also as a recruiter. The sole focus of the company on recruitment had to be clearly communicated to prospective clients. Its unique selling point is industry knowledge: it knows the best contractors. The message was communicated through the new website, new corporate identity, new stationary, advertising in trade journals and by attending trade exhibitions and meetings. Consequently, the size of the business has grown from recruiting (contracting) on average 45 people in 2009 to 92 in 2011 and 140 in 2012. </p>\r\n<p>EMS has also introduced changes to the payment system. Recruitment services differ from systems integration and so the company decided to set targets and a bonus scheme for its employees. The recruitment consultants receive a bonus if they reach the target. As a result, they became more sales oriented. This change was instigated by the external business consultant who proposed that the company offers financial incentives to staff in order to increase sales. </p>\r\n<p>In 2008, turnover and profits were strong. Both 2009 and 2010 were also good years: turnover increased but profits remained stable because of the investments and changes made in the business. Turnover in 2011 was over £5.5 million (approximately €7 million) and profit approximately £145,000 (€185,000). In 2012, the intention is that the turnover goes up to £8 million (€10.3 million) and profit will be £500,000 (€640,000). At half year point the company is on course for this. Its overheads stay roughly the same. Mr Casey interprets turnover growth to be a result of employing staff who focus exclusively on recruitment. Previously, in 2008/9, recruitment was mostly his personal responsibility in addition to doing other things.</p>\r\n<p>Alan Hatvany, recruitment consultant, joined EMS in 1995 as a draughtsman, and worked on systems integration as a designer for projects with large broadcasters such as Channel 4 and ITV. When the company introduced recruitment services and the systems integration closed, Mr Hatvany was offered the choice to move into the recruitment side of the business or to be sent out on contract through EMS Technical Personnel. He decided to become a recruiter in late 2008. Mr Hatvany felt that while he might not have the right personality for the job he understood the industry and the market well, which is a great advantage. Moreover, following his transfer into recruitment, he underwent recruitment training in 2011. This was a very intense three-day course where he learnt a lot of new recruitment techniques and ideas which he brought back to the team. Switching from systems integration to recruitment has been a positive experience in terms of financial rewards. He feels the company has benefited from the change: as a recruitment agency it is not subject to as many highs and lows as it experienced previously and is more profitable.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The case study of EMS Technical Personnel Ltd is an example of a company that was able to realise the shortcomings of its business model on time and identify new market opportunities that would keep the business afloat. EMS originally started as a small group of engineers providing systems integration services to the broadcasting industry. Mr Casey, the owner and director of EMS, had initiated major restructuring of the company by setting up a recruitment business to run along the existing systems integration services. Despite being an engineer with little experience of business management, he has been the driving force behind the efforts to diversify into recruitment. Eventually, EMS Limited, which was no longer profitable, stopped trading. The focus of EMS Technical Personnel Limited is fully on the recruitment of broadcast engineers and professionals. Consequently, the company has grown and currently has 140 contract staff working for clients, which outstrips its targets for 2012. </p>\r\n<p>The company has expanded into the post-production and operational areas of broadcasting and its long-term strategy is to expand the business further. With hindsight, Mr Casey would like to have implemented the changes earlier; he held back on this decision  because of loyalty to staff and the fact that he would have to make a number redundant. He feels that the advice and support received from the business consultant has been invaluable and would highly recommend such professional help to anyone wishing to start a business. </p>\r\n<p>Besides the implemented changes, EMS Technical Personnel has benefited from being in the industry that is going through a ‘boom time’. With the rise of the new technologies such as high definition and 3D, there is a lack of expertise in the industry. The company has been able to complement this with its services. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Eva Kašperová, John Kitching and David Smallbone, Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Dermot Casey, Owner and Director, EMS Technical Personnel Ltd</p>\r\n<p>Alan Hatvany, Recruitment Consultant, EMS Technical Personnel Ltd</p>\r\n<p><b>Company address</b></p>\r\n<p>EMS Technical Personnel Ltd</p>\r\n<p>Unit 113, The Light Box</p>\r\n<p>111 Power Road</p>\r\n<p>London W4 5PY</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p> <a HREF=""http://www.ems-tp.com/"">http://www.ems-tp.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"United Kingdom"~"78 - employment activities"~"10-49"~"0-9"~NULL~"closure*internal restructuring"~"2012-02-21"
"Eurodecal, France"~"Eurodecal"~"<p>The decision by its main client to cut all its orders caused this company specialising in the design of luxury ceramic goods to decide on restructuring; this entailed job losses, and freezes on promotion and pay. The company went into administration and filed for bankruptcy. A group of external consultants was contracted to assist staff who lost their jobs and provide them with training, skills assessment and assistance in finding employment; the costs being covered by local government. Following the restructuring, Eurodecal is diversifying its business, and seeks to avoid over-reliance on big clients.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Eurodecal is part of a group of companies under a holding company called LMA (employing 78 people overall prior to the restructuring of Eurodecal). The other companies are Albert Landgraf (Charleroi, Belgium) with 19 employees and Dekora (Méreau, France) with five employees. The core business of Albert Landgraf is indirect serigraphy and it mainly produces chromolithography for glass. Dekora was set up in 2005 and now sells enamel paints for porcelain on behalf of a German group called Ferro which had closed its two sites in France (employing 180 people) and relocated part of its activities to Germany in 2008. With the creation of Dekora, the group started a diversification strategy expanding the business to other markets. Until February 2010, Dekora was a subsidiary of Eurodecal; they then became sister companies and continue to develop synergies in relation to the decoration of ceramics.</p>\r\n<p>Eurodecal has two production sites in France located at Méreau and Limoges. Eurodecal specialises in printing on Limoges porcelain and luxury glass products (added value products). They are almost wholly dependent on other local firms, most of them with big export businesses (for example, Hermès). After the recent restructuring, the company has diversified its activities to cover direct serigraphy as well. However, the main business still remains the indirect serigraphy (accounting for 80% of the business). They do not export themselves though they have linkages both with their Belgian partner company and also with some German companies. </p>\r\n<p>The managing director of Eurodecal is Jean-Paul Maignan who, together with five other people, is one of the owners of LMA. He bought into the business in the late 1990s. He bought Centre Decal, based in Méreau, some 12 years ago and then took over other companies in the Limousin region and set up Eurodecal. Prior to these acquisitions, he worked in a bank and later as a consultant. He is also part of the ceramic ‘competitiveness pole’ (Pôle de competitivité de la ceramique), which is a specialised sectoral development cluster bringing together local business actors. He lives in Paris and has no family links in Méreau and Limoges, where Eurodecal has its office and production sites. He commutes regularly.</p>\r\n<p>Eurodecal is the biggest employer in the group. It employed 54 at the sites in Méreau and Limoges in 2008. After the most recent restructuring, it employs 34 people (two on temporary contract). The average age of Eurodecal employees is 42 years in Limoges and 50 years in Méreau. Of the 54 people working in Eurodecal prior to the restructuring, only four or five were managers <i>(‘cadres’</i>) / professionals. There are also some very specialised technical production staff, computer graphics artists and machine operators. More than a third of the workforce are naturalised French (of Arab and Portuguese origins).  </p>\r\n<p>The staff is represented by two unions: the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (Confédération française démocratique du travail, CFDT) and the General Confederation of Labour (Confédération générale du travail, CGT). There are four trade union representatives: one represents the professionals / managers and the other three represent the workers / employees. </p>\r\n<p>Before the most recent restructuring in 2009, Eurodecal was restructured in 2000–2001 with a social plan affecting 10 jobs, and again in 2005 when the company implemented a collective redundancy plan involving eight jobs. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring of Eurodecal was occasioned by a sharp fall in turnover in 2008–9 (turnover dropped from €4.6m in 2008 to €3.45m in 2010), itself brought about by a decision of a principal client (Hermès, accounting for 30% of Eurodecal’s business) to cut all orders from January 2009. Hermès restarted ordering in March 2010. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In summer 2009, the management informed the works council (<i>comité d'entreprise</i>) about the economic difficulties of the company. An action plan, which was presented to the works council in July 2009, indicated how the company intended to proceed vis-à-vis the public authorities (to extend the payment of social contributions and taxes) and the banks (to obtain medium-term credit). The plan also envisaged an injection of funds from the shareholders and the opening of the capital to a new shareholder. According to the initial schedule, the action plan was expected to be implemented by the end of October 2009 at the latest. At that time, no job losses were yet planned; however, the management already anticipated a possible headcount reduction in early 2010 pending the company results for 2009. At the July meeting the staff representatives were also informed that in case of an unsuccessful outcome of the action plan, declaring insolvency (<i>depôt de bilan</i>) was unavoidable. Two further meetings were held with the staff representatives in September and October to assess progress on the planned actions. In early November an extraordinary meeting of the works council was convened to inform the staff representatives of the imminent insolvency. Another two meetings (of which one was held in the presence of the administrator) were held to inform the staff of the Méreau and Limoges sites about the situation and answer their questions. </p>\r\n<p>The company was restructured in December 2009 with the loss of 23 jobs (18 job losses in Mereau and five job losses in Limoges) due to the very sharp fall-off in business. Some of the 18 redundant workers at the Mereau site had 32 years’ service. There were no redundancies in the Belgian Albert Landgraf business, where the company made recourse to the short-time work scheme (<a HREF=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef10637.htm"">Belgian chomage partiel</a>). In an effort to avoid redundancies, Eurodecal had also resorted to the short-time work scheme (<a HREF=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef10633.htm"">French chomage partiel</a>) in spring 2009 for the period May–June. However, the application was not renewed because the French scheme is regarded as much less user-friendly and overall is employed less frequently than in Belgium.</p>\r\n<p>Unions agreed to the social plan, which was voted unanimously by the works council (<i>comité d’entreprise</i>). In addition to the job losses, promotion and pay freezes had also been agreed. Once agreed, the social plan involves selecting individual candidates for redundancy with reference to detailed, objective and pre-established criteria (age, marital status, number of children, etc.). The names of the redundant workers were then communicated to the works council. The whole process of selection of redundant posts is considered objective and removes any taint of partiality. Managers and professionals were less affected by the restructuring than other workers. </p>\r\n<p>In compliance with French law, the affected staff received notification of the dismissal by registered letter. The staff were shocked and deeply traumatised by this restructuring. However, they realised that the business was in trouble and no major crises or strikes occurred – aside from some bitterness on part of two or three staff directed at unions for not saving jobs. In addition, two of the employee representatives on the works council lost their jobs. The managing director was himself very concerned about the employees and felt that he bore some responsibilities for the restructuring. He offered to meet redundant workers individually, if they wished. </p>\r\n<p>The company was required by law to sign an agreement of personal reclassification (<i>convention de reclassement personalisé</i>) with the local branch of the Directorate for labour, employment and training (direction départemental du travail, de l’Emploi et de la Formation Professionnelle – <a HREF=""http://www.travail.gouv.fr/"">DDTEFP</a>). The agreement entitles each affected worker to choose either to serve two months’ notice before leaving the company or to renounce the two-month notice and receive training and assistance to find another job and counselling services. In the framework of the agreement of personalised reclassification,  redundant employees (with at least two years of service in the company) are entitled to an allowance which amounts to 80% of the salary during the first eight months and 70% for the following four months (this allowance is higher than the ordinary unemployment allowance). At the time of the restructuring, Pôle Emploi (the French government employment centre) encouraged the redundant workers to opt for the agreement of personal reclassification. </p>\r\n<p>Eurodecal went into administration and initiated the liquidation procedure on 17 November 2009. This was the first step in the most recent restructuring. It involved the appointment of an administrator who took co-charge of management during the observation period (<i>periode d’observation</i>). The managing director continued to deal with routine administration while the administrator was responsible for validating the main decisions and managing the finances. There were regular progress meetings every three months with the commercial court. In the early stages, the administrator appeared to want to sell the business. It took three months to gain the confidence of the administrator. The observation period was renewed twice. The first observation period ran from 17 November 2009 until 23 March 2010. It was then renewed until September 2010, and further renewed until December 2010. As part of the restructuring, the shareholder owners injected new funds in January 2010 (€200,000) to improve the cash flow.</p>\r\n<p>As soon as the company filed for bankruptcy, the Société Générale bank closed the Eurodecal account and the company was required to open another account at a bank specialised in dealing with companies in administration. During the observation period, the business had no credit and could not overdraw money. Also, the personal bank account of the managing director was closed and his credit card was taken back. In addition, he was not entitled to any remuneration during the observation period. </p>\r\n<p>The managing director of Eurodecal informed the 15 main clients about the insolvency two days before formal proceedings were initiated. A presentation was prepared beforehand to explain the reasons for the insolvency. During the observation period, major clients were kept abreast of developments. Other clients were informed about the insolvency and the developments on a case-by-case basis upon request. Strategic suppliers (suppliers of raw material and banks) were informed in the same way as major clients, while other suppliers and public creditors were informed in writing by the court officer. </p>\r\n<p>The business formally exited the observation period in December 2010 when its continuation plan (plan de continuation de redressement) was accepted by the Commercial Court. Since then, Eurodecal has recruited three of its former employees who had been made redundant in 2009. It is obligatory that former workers are offered jobs that are created when business recovers first. However, some workers turned down the offer because they had been severely traumatised by the restructuring. Only five of the former employees applied for a vacancy at the Mereau site.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Eurodecal operates in a sector in decline which employs about 2,000 people in France nowadays. This decline is due to the weakening of demand (fewer weddings and therefore  less demand for 72-piece plate sets) and competition from other big producers (for example, Ikea and Linea) which put less luxurious but more affordable products on the market. The turning point was in 1995, when the sector started going downhill with the collapse of big players. Bernardaud is now the biggest business in this sector, with approximately 350 workers. Although companies in this sector receive subsidies from the region through the ceramic ‘competitiveness pole’ (<i>Pôle de competitivité de la ceramique</i>), they are below the radar of much public aid. This is a sector that carries less influence than other sectors (for example car manufacturing) because it is in decline with a comparatively small number of workers. </p>\r\n<p>One of the problems, common to all companies operating in the sector, is the lack of anticipation and of a coordinated approach to respond to the decline in market demand and competition from other countries. One reason is that managers often lack the management skills and technical competencies to run the business. Better coordination between the companies operating in this sector should be achieved through the ceramic competitiveness pole. </p>\r\n<p>The decline of this sector and therefore the greater exposure to the recession is also due to the fact that most of the companies are small and medium-sized businesses with a weak capital base and low profitability. This makes them less attractive for potential investors. Another factor that contributes to the weakening of the competitiveness of these enterprises is the high labour costs in France (especially in a market open to products coming from countries with low labour costs). Eurodecal also encountered some difficulties during the observation period: the business had no credit (<i>credit fournisseur</i>) and had to settle immediately with suppliers while still waiting up to three months for settlement from its clients. There are new rules obliging faster settlement of debts which are, however, not being observed. Medef employers’ confederation has a role to play to foster better compliance with new rules.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The most important sources of professional help during restructuring were the company’s lawyer and the chartered accountant. Both had worked with the company prior to the restructuring. The company received very little support from public sources. Eurodecal was not eligible for many of the measures designed to help SMEs, including the long-term loan guarantee provided by OSEO (support agency for the development of SMEs). </p>\r\n<p>In terms of support to redundant workers, a group of external consultants was contracted to assist staff who lost their jobs and provide them with relevant support measures (for example training, skills assessment, assistance in finding employment, etc.). The costs were entirely covered by the departmental directorate for labour, employment and training. This support partly overlaps with Pôle Emploi’s interventions within the agreement of personalised reclassification. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Following the restructuring, Eurodecal continues to diversify its business to cover direct serigraphy and to expand to new markets. The new diversification strategy, which started in 2010, will be implemented over the next three years (until 2014). This is deemed necessary for the survival of the company in the long term. The action plan is being implemented by a steering committee (comité de pilotage) set up for both Eurodecal and Dekora. Managers have a key role in the organisation – they are responsible for safeguarding employment in the face of the crisis and for ensuring the future viability of the company. </p>\r\n<p>The versatility and multi-skilling of the staff is another important element of the company’s strategy. Most of the staff are able and qualified to fill another post if necessary. This entails the provision of training, especially for added value jobs. The aim is to make the organisation more flexible and ensure that all deadlines are respected. This includes recourse to the variation of weekly working hours (<i>modulation</i>) to adjust quickly to market fluctuations and client demand. Eurodecal is also keen to avoid any over-reliance on big clients such as Hermès – which now accounts for about 17% of the company’s business. </p>\r\n<p>There are now regular meetings with the managers and other staff members to help them be more prepared and react promptly to changing circumstances. Everyone is fully involved to make it work, consulted in relation to decisions taken by the management and staff are ready to work longer hours when necessary. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring did not impact negatively on the image of the business. This is most likely due to the fact that many other businesses in the sector were faced with the same problems and were forced to trim their workforce or go through liquidation procedures. Also, competitors in the sector did not take advantage of Eurodecal’s difficulties and take its share of the market. All in all, Eurodecal came out of the liquidation procedures in a more competitive position.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>This restructuring could possibly have been avoided if the company had reacted faster and sooner to the first signs of the crisis back in November 2008 by diversifying more and injecting funds earlier. Anticipation and planning are essential to safeguard the business and its employment. The three-year action plan adopted by the company ensures that these key aspects will not be overlooked in the future.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>\r\n<a HREF=""_GoBack""></a> Author<a HREF=""_GoBack""></a>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>Sara Riso, Eurofound</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Jean-Paul Maignan, managing director, Eurodecal</p>\r\n<p>Akli Chia, employee representative, Eurodecal (CFDT) </p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.euro-decal.com/"">http://www.euro-decal.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"France"~"18 - printing and reproduction of recorded media"~"50-249"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"(avoiding) bankruptcy*internal restructuring"~"2011-03-25"
"Eurofreight Logistics, Cyprus"~"Eurofreight Logistics Ltd"~"<p>This forwarding and logistics company decided to take advantage of the economic crisis by supplying a market demand for a total logistic solution under one roof – low-cost road and sea freight of smaller consignments with an international perspective. This required the firm’s expansion; while risky, given the economic climate in Greece, the project was able to capitalise on the availability of highly skilled staff who were rescued from a struggling Greek firm. The contraction of lending by Greek banks is a challenge for this company and similar smaller companies, who have problems accessing growth capital in the form of long-term loans.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Eurofreight Logistics Ltd<b> </b> (EFL)<b> </b> is a leading forwarding and logistics company in Cyprus, with 73 employees (64 in Cyprus and 9 in Greece), delivering a wide range of specialised capabilities and solutions to clients across all industries. It was established in Larnaca in 1999, as the outcome of a merger of two micro-enterprises, G &amp; L Forwarding, founded in 1990 by Leonidas Leonidou and George Papachristodoulou, and CPA UCS Clearing &amp; Forwarding, founded by Christodoulos Partou and George Adamou. It is a privately held company, with the four owner/managers enjoying equal distribution of shares. </p>\r\n<p>The owner/managers play key roles in the organisational structure which is driven by the services offered. There is no formal works council in the firm but, due to a very participative management and a family-like culture, employees are often invited to participate in open forums so that they can be updated on developments.  </p>\r\n<p>In the early years, EFL focused predominantly on the Larnaca market, offering clearing and freight services to local firms and associates. Following their early success, the founding team expanded operations to offer more integrated solutions to an expanding client base operating across the small island economy. With the configuration of the business model, EFL enjoyed steady growth, expanding via economies of scale and scope. More recently, and in the context of overseas expansion via a merger and acquisition in Greece, the firm is active in international development. EFL has been developing in the context of a five-year strategic plan designed to strengthen its overall competitiveness and performance. The company has engineered efficient processing systems and is employing technologies to stay at the forefront of a constantly evolving industry. EFL has developed from a forwarding company into a leading logistics provider in Cyprus, thus strengthening its supply chain capabilities, which in turn present new opportunities for growth and efficiency for clients. Moreover, Eurofreight partners, representing some of the leading forwarding companies in Europe, are offered a high-quality service at a reasonable cost.</p>\r\n<p>More specifically, the firm continues to invest in state-of-the-art facilities – integrated offices and warehousing, located at a prime location (characterised as a transport hub linking motorways and the main international airport) – which enables both operational efficiency and the engineering of logistics solutions for local and international firms. </p>\r\n<p>EFL has managed to grow from its small base and has evolved its business model into an integrated logistics firm that offers total customised transportation solutions, for example, providing third-party logistics  in Cyprus and being the first Cyprus company to offer supply chain solutions to a multinational corporation – Merck Animal Health.</p>\r\n<p>With the accession of Cyprus into the European Union and the opening of more trading channels across eastern and western Europe, third-party logistics (known as 3PL; and sometimes 4PL when another firm, as a subcontractor, undertakes to deliver certain services) has been promoted as an innovation process that can offer operational and working capital efficiency to trading partners, which is so vital in their quest for competitiveness. Eurofreight engineered the 3PL solution that can address the mounting pressures on trading parties both on the demand and supply side of the market. The operation is also integrated into a software platform that enables efficient ordering, invoicing, shipping, and working capital management by the trading partners. This operation reduces the lead time and enhances the responsiveness to customer demand. </p>\r\n<p>This winning business model has also earned for EFL the 2007 Cyprus Employers and Industrialists Association Innovation Award for pioneering 3PL logistics services for local and international partners, for example Adidas and Miele. </p>\r\n<p>Today, EFL continues to partner leading brands such as Adidas and Miele which seek improved lead times, better management of the supply chain, working capital efficiencies and valued-added services. The successful development of 3PL solutions for international firms has leveraged EFL operations in the core business which includes freight services. However, in the middle of a prolonged financial and economic crisis, EFL is experiencing a combination of growth pains, for example resource bottlenecks and competitive pressures to discover new avenues of growth. </p>\r\n<p>The purpose of this case study is to discuss the strategic issues emanating from the latest major restructuring, namely: the expansion of the firm by developing the 3PL business model that offers integrated logistics solution to key brands and internationalisation strategy with Eurofreight Hellas in Greece to exploit the Athens-Thessaloniki-Cyprus hub.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p><b>Core business model – early growth:</b> In the early days, growth focused on attracting partners via freight services but gradually it has shifted focus to offering integrated logistics management services to local firms and also, increasingly, to world class companies seeking a local logistics firm to manage their local and regional distribution hub.</p>\r\n<p><b>New business model innovation-based growth horizons:</b> With the accession of Cyprus into the European Union and the opening of more trading channels across east and west Europe, third-party logistics (3PL; and sometimes 4PL) has been promoted as an innovation process that can offer trading partners operational and working capital efficiency. </p>\r\n<p>The firm has been working on its core business, which is logistics, but also on offering high value based solutions to its clients, as follows: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Costs: striving for cost leadership, following investment\r\nin purpose-built efficient-scale facilities and continuous pursuit of cost\r\nreduction across operating processes without sacrificing business\r\nperformance.</li>\r\n<li>Efficiency: using state of the art technologies, building\r\npartnerships with professionals streamlining processes allows integrated supply\r\nchain solutions with high-end efficiency—to deliver on time.</li>\r\n<li>Differentiation: engineering new innovative solutions,\r\nfor example, 3PL and 4PL tailored to the business model of their clients and\r\npartners.</li>\r\n<li>Supply chain management focus: campaigning for\r\nvalue-added services that can enhance the competitiveness of their\r\nclients.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The major restructuring event to be further analysed in this case study is the development of the Cyprus-Athens-Thessaloniki hub. It constitutes the latest strategic activity of EFL which is proving ‘the opportunity’ triggered by the current crisis. </p>\r\n<p>The firm also has a number of projects that offer additional revenue streams and will help build a long-term relationship with its clients. The winning business model has been the 3PL (sometimes 4PL) logistics which offers operational efficiency to its clients. In a nutshell, a total logistic solution under one roof is an integral part of process innovation as it offers better cost structure and higher customer loyalty. It adds value to all stages of the distribution process: from shipping out of the factory, to receiving at port/airport, to order execution and re-export. EFL, with its regional expertise, masters freight issues with airlines, shipping lines, customs, and port authorities and ensures an efficient flow of products. Overall, the engagement of EFL as a strategic partner contributes to reduced lead times, with timely and frequent shipping of goods within 24 hours. Moreover, it can offer more added value to products through repackaging, relabeling and allowing flexibility in order sizing. Obviously, 3PL logistics allows EFL to offer all its services to their partnering firms, thus boosting the operational efficiency of the core business. </p>\r\n<p>The firm is also exploring several new ideas for strategic innovation. During the good times, EFL could offer training programmes to employees with a view to promoting innovation-based growth by looking at the new business models under investigation. The firm is now investigating the launch of a dedicated logistics service to cater for the needs of pharmaceutical and food-related ventures –as these sectors are proving resilient during the crisis. Another emerging growth opportunity is the energy sector. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>For many years EFL has been partnering with Greek firms in order to deliver air and sea freight services to trading firms. In the midst of the prolonged economic crisis, more and more firms sourcing their products from Europe looked for low-cost road transportation for smaller consignments to reach the Greek ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki and then via sea-freight further on to Limassol, in Cyprus. </p>\r\n<p>Eurofreight was the first freight forwarding company in Cyprus and Greece that offered a reliable and fast door to door courier service for small parcels at a cost lower than that offered by traditional couriers. </p>\r\n<p>This trend has shown EFL the opportunities that can emerge in the crisis. Following market analysis and consultations with associate agents that the firm cooperated with in Greece, a feasibility study was presented by the chief executive officer and finance director to the board of directors. The decision was taken to expand with the formation of Eurofreight Hellas – a sister company where the majority shareholder is EFL-Cyprus. Minority shareholders include members of the top management team working for EFL Cyprus and Eurofreight Hellas. The new firm was to be used as a vehicle to save certain business accounts that were handled by a Greek agency, UFS S.A., that was about to file for bankruptcy. The formation of the new firm was made easy due to the fact that Eurofreight Cyprus had been trading with UFS S.A. for some years and thus legally did a debt rollover. Moreover, they ‘cherry picked’ staff and customers. </p>\r\n<p>With the deepening of the economic crisis, the establishment of EFL-Hellas (despite market risk) was imperative, both for strategic and operational reasons. On the operational side, there was a lot of red tape in mastering the freight procedures, which called for a dedicated team to expedite matters, but also to ensure trading partners were creditworthy, given the lack of liquidity which was hampering many enterprises. On the strategic side, given the prolonged macro-economic crisis there were market opportunities for Cyprus-based Eurofreight to expand with low-cost transportation solutions for Cyprus-based trading partners, but also to pick up more business from rival Greek firms struggling to cope with the repercussions of the recession.</p>\r\n<p>The company is now seeking to offer these low-cost solutions to more clients sourcing their goods (such as spare parts or computers) from central Europe, where lead times are secondary to economies of scale. Moreover, there is an effort to synchronise the ordering of EFL’s representative offices in Cyprus and Greece in order to achieve economies of scale in terms of volume trade discounts and, of course, to ensure lower transport costs.</p>\r\n<p>The project Eurofreight Hellas was launched in Athens in the early summer of 2010 and the formation of the new firm took about three months. Given the familiarity of the Greek market and rolling the operations of the struggling firm (UFS SA) into Eurofreight Hellas, the expansion of the new firm was orchestrated from Cyprus in order to keep the costs down. </p>\r\n<p>It involved regular trips by the chief executive officer to appoint the managing director who had to build the Greek team, which was based almost entirely on key members of the Greek firm that defaulted as a result of the recession. </p>\r\n<p>Overall, it is estimated that about €60,000 has been invested in EFL-Hellas, which basically involves a dedicated team of professionals, operating from two offices, and one in Athens and one in Thessaloniki. In the light of market uncertainty, collapse of trading norms due to lack of liquidity, and deteriorating trading relations, capital expenditure and offering trade credit was kept to a minimum. </p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the formal strategic development business plan set out tactics to streamline operations and shed costs. Thus, despite market declarations, and the offer of integrated logistics solutions, the firm also planned to outsource certain activities to other local service providers, for example warehousing and transport. This was essential to manage risk but also in order to concentrate on the vital part of the logistics chain – bringing in new clients and ensuring they get customised, value-added solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The development of Eurofreight Hellas was a risky venture given the economic climate in Greece, but the project was able to capitalise on the availability of highly skilled staff that were rescued from the struggling Greek firm. The original team have been instrumental in guiding Eurofreight Hellas during this turmoil, in order to save the trading activities of EFL in Greece and of course to capture and build more niche business opportunities. </p>\r\n<p>There are, of course, a series of internal and external constraints hampering growth as part of restructuring. Historically, the firm has been financing growth by retaining profits and borrowing from the banks. However, local banks are now experiencing problems due to the Greek crisis (which has meant the hair-cut of Greek government bonds; and defaulting on loans to the private sector in Greece) which erodes their capital base and thus their lending power. Subsequently, smaller companies with growth aspirations such as EFL are experiencing a finance gap. They have problems accessing growth capital in the form of long-term loans; their working capital, in the form of overdrafts, is being rationed; and of course higher interest rates have further hit profitability.</p>\r\n<p>The crisis has hit the sector as trading volumes have fallen and rivals are engaged in price wars in their effort to sustain their performance. Since the company has grown organically (growth was financed with internal profits and external debt), it was felt that that the firm had reached a stage where it was essential to bring in strategic partners to enable the enhancement of investment in the financial and human capital base. </p>\r\n<p>It is imperative to develop the business to the next stage in order to overcome some of the classic SME constraints that relate to the narrow resource base and inertia of owner/managers to radically address certain operational issues and strategic challenges in the context of the prolonged recession. The recapitalisation of the business and the strengthening of its top management team could enhance its strategic capability to master the ongoing organisational and market challenges and, more importantly, to seize emerging opportunities in the growing logistics sector.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The executive management team, which is dominated by owner/managers, have prepared a feasibility study (with technical input from outside financial consultants and legal experts) which was presented to the board of directors, which includes in addition to the four owner/managers, three non-executives, including the chairperson. The Greek expansion was approved as a part of the strategic development plan to allow the necessary restructuring of operations to and from Greece. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>In the early days of the restructuring, finance director Paris Papageorgiou and chief executive officer of Eurofreight Cyprus had to travel regularly to Athens to streamline Greek operations and offer an induction to the Athens team about the new regime; the operations are now managed by the newly appointed managing director, Demetrios Nikitopoulos. There was limited impact on the Cyprus based team, simply because they have been dealing with the Greeks as UFS SA. </p>\r\n<p>The EFL Hellas operation resulted in the saving of nine jobs (two people working for UFS SA left the operation) and subsequently led to the establishment of some part-time, pro-rata posts and business for associates. It is notable that the Demetrios Nikitopoulos and Paris Papageorgiou, who have played a key role in the planning and implementation of this major restructuring event, have been awarded a small minority shareholding in EFL Hellas.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the firm decided to pay the salaries and wages for the Greek team who remained unpaid for a two-month period during the default of UFS SA and the transition to the new firm. This ethically respected gesture has boosted the empathy between the Greek team and the new management, which has translated into good early operational results.  </p>\r\n<p>More specifically, the managing director who is accountable to the chief executive officer of EFL Cyprus, in cooperation with the Athens team, took effective action on two fronts: to reduce costs – by reorganising operations and outsourcing more services; and classing clients in terms of creditworthiness and scope for cross-selling.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of operational efficiency, it is notable that the new enterprise enjoys administration from Cyprus (ordering, credit management, invoicing and handling management) as it is fully integrated in the IT system and financial function.</p>\r\n<p>In the early days, business was heavily dependent on Cyprus-based firms using their services, but gradually more and more new contracts were secured from new customers, mainly Greek trading firms – especially those serving Greece, Cyprus and the nearby markets. </p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, other large market players, such as international courier companies, have been lined up as partners of EFL, as they seek to use the European economy transport route via road and sea-freight option (which involves seven to nine days) for certain  clients dealing with durable goods who want  to lower their cost structures.  </p>\r\n<p>The fact that about a third of the volume of trade that EFL Cyprus is handling is now associated with the Hellas operation is a testimony that the restructuring is offering a competitive advantage. EFL Hellas delivers value both to EFL and its partners but ironically also some of its direct and indirect competitors due to horizontal partnerships that are symptomatic of how logistics work. </p>\r\n<p>As a result of the expansion with the Hellas operation, the firm managed to pick up very important clients such as ECCO shoes, transporting volume from Poland to Greece on the road and then via sea-freight from Piraeus in Greece to Limassol in Cyprus. This route offers tremendous cost savings for ECCO and, of course, expanding business for EFL. </p>\r\n<p>Now that the Hellas operation is integrated into the parent company, the company can start to take advantage of the challenges from the economic crisis and to enjoy early growth. The managing director of Hellas EFL is also offering business development support to EFL-Cyprus. Indeed, he has been instrumental in securing a few high-value contracts that leverage the market position of both operations. For example, EFL now handles the operations of many Greek-based organisations such as Public, Marinopoulos, and Eshop. </p>\r\n<p>In the context of mapping new growth avenues, EFL has managed to get the contract to offer sophisticated logistics support to PHC which manages a chain of restaurants which include Pizza Hut, KFC, and Hobo’s. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>This case study epitomises how restructuring can help SMEs to enhance their long-term development by seizing opportunities, especially during the crisis. Basically, EFL has engineered solutions including 3PL and 4PL and low-cost transport routes via Greece, for its trading partners searching for economies central to their sustainable competitiveness. </p>\r\n<p>According to the chief executive officer of EFL, George Papachristodoulou:</p>\r\n<BLOCK-QUOTE><p>\r\n<i>In the short run, the crisis is proving traumatic, but\r\nfor us, given our robust business model built on partnering and offering value\r\nto our clients, this crisis is helping us to consolidate our future growth path.\r\nThe shaking up of our market will get rid of cowboys that will not make it and\r\nsmart firms naturally will embrace our professional ethos and practice. What we\r\nexpect from the government is to cooperate with the banks and perhaps help out\r\nto channel growth capital in the context of a loan guarantee scheme.\r\n</i> </p></BLOCK-QUOTE><p>Today, EFL is on a mission to kick-start a new business model by offering sophisticated logistics for the food and pharmaceutical sectors (insulated from the macro-economic cycle). Thus, the next restructuring event is now on the horizon: expansion of its operation via building a purpose-built warehousing-distribution system to offer logistics but also high value-added services to food firms and restaurant chains. </p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the firm has growth capacity as it enjoys a unique capability platform which includes: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>long-lasting relations with other prestigious logistics\r\nfirms such as TNT, UPS; </li>\r\n<li>a prime location, 5–6 kilometres away from the new\r\nLarnaca International Airport; </li>\r\n<li>state-of-the art warehousing (with plans to build more\r\nfacilities in the free trade zone); </li>\r\n<li>a network of partners in 120 nations; </li>\r\n<li>sophisticated IT platform;</li>\r\n<li>logistics expertise to handle standard and complex\r\ncargo.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>EFL is ready to cater for any project in Cyprus (and offshore) which is an emerging hub for new energy and utilities projects to deal with gas, radioactive materials, telecom and electricity. Cyprus is proving to be one of the bridges between East and West, North and South. Recent findings of sizeable gas reserves in the sea between Cyprus, Israel and Egypt has stimulated explorations for new projects that will boost the macro-economic multiplier effect and thus further boost trading in the region. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Panikkos Poutziouris and Elias Hadjielias, UCLan Cyprus  </p>\r\n<p>Milena Marinova, Zateons Associates, Business Advisors </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>George Papachristodoulou, Chief executive officer EFL, </p>\r\n<p>Demetrios Nikitopoulos, Managing director of Eurofreight Hellas </p>\r\n<p>Paris Papageorgiou, Finance director EFL </p>\r\n<p><b>Company address</b></p>\r\n<p>Eurofreight Logistics Ltd, </p>\r\n<p>11 Europe Street, </p>\r\n<p>7100 Aradippou,</p>\r\n<p>Larnaka,</p>\r\n<p>Cyprus</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p>www.eurofreight.com</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Cyprus"~"52 - warehousing and support activities for transportation"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"globalisation*recession/crisis"~"business expansion"~"2012-02-24"
"Europlan Engineering, Finland"~"Europlan Engineering Ltd"~"<p>When the major client of Finnish project management company Europlan Engineering experienced business difficulties, the company decided to look for new markets and to change its focus from planning and design towards the provision of turnkey solutions. It sold the design and planning side of its business, which involved the transfer of 50 out of 80 employees. Shortly afterwards, it acquired&nbsp;HN-Yhti&ouml;t so that the company could have its own production. The two companies have been integrated to save costs and exploit synergies; however, this did involve the dismissal of administrative workers from HN-Yhti&ouml;t.</p>"~"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Europlan Engineering Ltd is a project management company offering turnkey solutions in shipbuilding, industry and building construction. The company was established in 1990 from the remains of W&auml;rtsil&auml; Marine Ltd, which went bankrupt in 1989. Europlan focused mainly on planning and design services for the marine industry up to the year 2010. At the end of the 1990s, Europlan Engineering Ltd also started to provide turnkey solutions for new buildings and conversions in the shipbuilding industry. Nowadays, the company offers complete turnkey solutions, from planning and design to installations and post-delivery support, and it has widened its target sectors to three.</p>\r\n<p>The current Managing Director, Jari Savola, joined the company in 1996 after completing his studies in mechanical engineering. He worked in project management tasks and was responsible for the development of turnkey deliveries. He bought his first shares in the company in 1999 and in 2006 became the main owner. He served first as the chairman of the board, but became managing director as well in 2008. Nowadays, Jari Savola owns 92% and Financial Director Perttu Tuominen 8% of the company. The organisational structure is very flat. In addition to managing and financial directors, there are two other manager-level posts in the company: HR manager and network manager.</p>\r\n<p>Europlan Engineering Ltd employs about 30 employees and a further 30 employees work in Hermann&rsquo;s Finland Ltd (former HN-Yhti&ouml;t Ltd), the company bought by Europlan Engineering Ltd in 2010 (as part of the restructuring event described below). Hermann&rsquo;s Finland Ltd is a production technology company specialising in interior solutions. Both companies operate in the same premises in Raisio, Finland. The employees of Europlan Engineering Ltd are mainly clerical workers such as project managers, project assistants, designers and supervisors. At Hermann&rsquo;s Finland Ltd, employees are more involved in production tasks. The educational background of employees varies from higher education to vocational degrees. Most of the employees have a technical education.</p>\r\n<p>The company was on a growth path from 2000 until 2010. The turnover of Europlan Engineering Ltd was about &euro;10 million in 2005 and it rose to &euro;60 million in 2008. In 2011 turnover fell to &euro;5 million due to the difficult situation in the shipyard of Turku, Finland. A comprehensive restructuring was initiated.</p>\r\n<p>There is no works council in the company, but there are shop stewards representing the employees. The shop steward serves as a local negotiator, conciliator and channel of communication between the employer and the employees. Shop stewards have been involved in the restructuring procedures related to dismissals as required by the Act on Cooperation within Undertakings (or <a href=""http://www.guidetoworkinginfinland.fi/cms/index.php?yt"">YT Act</a>) applied in all businesses with a regular staff of at least 20 employees in Finland. The company also has close relationships with the trade unions.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>During its history, the company has been heavily dependent on the Turku shipyard. Ten big cruise vessels were built in the shipyard during 1999&ndash;2010 and the shipyard has been an important employer in the region. Basically, the turnover of Europlan Engineering Ltd was derived from the shipyard and the company was able to grow organically as a network partner of the marine cluster. In 2010, one large cruise ship was finalised in the shipyard. After that there were no big orders on their way and the shipyard lost a major order for a new cruise ship in February 2011. When the markets started to decline, competition increased. Due to these structural changes in the shipbuilding industry during the global financial and economic crisis, there were in practice almost no new orders received for a year and the turnover of the company started to decrease. To ensure its future survival, the company started to look for new markets and opportunities. Major restructuring was also required inside the company to get the business back on track.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Europlan Engineering Ltd had historically focused mostly on planning and design services, but Jari Savola saw the future potential in turnkey deliveries. He saw that the sizes of cruise ships have reached their limit, meaning that shipyard orders will get smaller in future. Therefore, the focus on the turnkey solutions would be more profitable. In addition to new buildings, Jari Savola also considered it necessary to operate more in conversion projects to be able to better compete in the markets. Europlan Engineering Ltd started to implement changes in its strategy in 2010, a year before Turku shipyard lost the major order.</p>\r\n<p>At first, the company gave up their design and planning business. Due to its project-based nature, Jari Savola had been thinking about selling out the business since he bought the company. The decision was finally made in spring 2010 when the order book was almost empty. At that time there were about 80 employees working at Europlan Engineering Ltd and about 50 of those were sold out to another company. Jari Savola states that it was not a proper acquisition but it was more like a business transfer as the employees moved to a temporary work agency owned by the former owner of Europlan Engineering Ltd. The process went smoothly as all the parties knew one another and the transferred employees were able to continue designing work. Some designers were left in Europlan Engineering Ltd, but the company designs nowadays only for their own purposes as a part of their turnkey services. The company also uses the services of their former employees in their projects.</p>\r\n<p>According to their new strategy focusing on turnkey deliveries and international markets, the directors of Europlan Engineering Ltd considered it beneficial to have own production. This was the main motivation behind the acquisition of HN-Yhti&ouml;t Ltd in the autumn 2010. Through the acquisition, Europlan Engineering Ltd has been able to widen its business to new markets and fields and to offer turnkey services to the customers. HN-Yhti&ouml;t Ltd had also offered turnkey deliveries in the maritime industry, but the focus had been more on interior solutions. Now, after the acquisition the focus of the company has been shifted more towards the Finnish construction industry, whereas Europlan Engineering operates internationally in the marine industry.</p>\r\n<p>Europlan Engineering Ltd had not made any systematic plans to acquire another company, but Jari Savola got to know the CEO of HN-Yhti&ouml;t Ltd, when the idea of buying the company arose. The first contacts with HN-Yhti&ouml;t Ltd were made at the turn of the year 2009&ndash;2010, but the actual negotiations following the due diligence took place during summer 2010 and they lasted about three months. The negotiations were intense, but went smoothly as both parties had the same interest. There was a timetable, but no written, formal plans set for the acquisition process. Jari Savola and financial director Perttu Tuominen carried out the due diligence by themselves. The lawyer was used only in drawing up the official contracts. The key persons &ndash; that is, the managers &ndash; in Europlan Engineering Ltd were informed about the plans to acquire HN-Yhti&ouml;t Ltd and their opinions were sought.</p>\r\n<p>The acquisition was finalised at the end of 2010 when Europlan Engineering Ltd bought 51% of HN-Yhti&ouml;t Ltd. The payment was made in cash. There were about 35 employees in HN-Yhti&ouml;t Ltd at the time of the acquisition. The personnel of the two companies were informed when the deal had been finalised. A press release was issued to inform trade unions, customers and interest groups about the acquisition. HN-Yhti&ouml;t Ltd was the bankrupted estate of Hermann&rsquo;s Finland Ltd formed in 2009. Due to its good reputation the name was changed back to Hermann&rsquo;s Finland Ltd in February 2011.</p>\r\n<p>The original plan was to have two separate companies operating in their own premises, but after the lost cruise ship order the managing director made a quick decision to integrate the two companies to save costs and exploit synergies of the two companies, for example by having a joint administration and data system. Jari Savola is the director of both companies, but despite the joint administration the two companies have the same organisational structure they used to have. These changes happened within a month. Europlan Engineering Ltd sold their own premises and moved to the premises of Hermann&rsquo;s Finland Ltd in Raisio in March 2011. Following this move, administrative workers (about 10) from Hermann&rsquo;s Finland Ltd were dismissed. As the CEO already knew the personnel in Europlan Engineering it was a rather straightforward decision for him to dismiss the personnel from Hermann&rsquo;s Finland Ltd. The codetermination negotiations went rather smoothly and were conducted in a constructive atmosphere, insofar as that is possible in situations where painful decisions are made.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the poor order book in Turku shipyard, Europlan Engineering Ltd has looked for new markets for their services abroad. This has required lots of travelling by the managing director who is responsible for negotiating the deals. However, the internationalisation and expansion of business has been done systematically. The company has selected five shipping companies with which it cooperates. The idea is to learn the customers&rsquo; way of working and build close relationship with them and this way to grow own business. The same kind of strategy was also applied in Turku shipyard.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>According to Jari Savola, there were no major challenges related to the implementation of restructuring. The acquisition of HN-Yhti&ouml;t Ltd went smoothly as the buyers were already familiar with the business type and sector. The only thing that the management would have done differently is related to the due diligence. After the acquisition the management realised they had relied too much on the good reputation and the long history of Hermann&rsquo;s Finland Ltd and they should have paid more attention to its current deals and projects. The results of the current deals should have been evaluated in more detail and taken into account in the selling price as it was found out later that two of the projects of the company were unprofitable.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The managing director Jari Savola has had the main role in the restructuring implemented in the company and basically no external help has been used. He described the acquisition process as a challenging and interesting learning process. For him it was an obvious decision to carry out the process by himself together with the financial director and not to access any support: &lsquo;When you do everything by yourself, you can be sure of what you are buying.&rsquo; Jari Savola can be defined as a serial and portfolio entrepreneur currently owning five or six companies. His previous experience in selling and buying companies has taught him a lot and was also helpful in the restructuring of Europlan Engineering Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>Financial support was not obtained for the actual restructuring events, but Europlan Engineering Ltd has received support for activities carried out after the restructuring. Financing from Tekes (the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation) and ELY Centre (Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment) has been received for projects related to launching the services business and product development. These supports were considered important in terms of the internationalisation.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The first reactions of employees towards the acquisition were varied. Some had a neutral reaction while some saw the changes in a more negative light. As Europlan Engineering Ltd moved to new facilities, there was some resistance. While the distance between the old and new location is only about 15 kilometres, for some employees the journey to work became longer; however, on the other hand, for some people it got shorter.</p>\r\n<p>The split into two companies was evident in the beginning, but after a year both sides are seeing the positive sides of the restructuring. The management has tried its best to create a good working atmosphere, for example by organising some joint events for the staff.</p>\r\n<p>Many types of cost savings have been used in the company. There have been some redundancies made in both of the companies among all employee groups. Also there was a one-week-long compulsory unpaid leave for all the workers. Typically the company offers a lot of training for their clerical workers, but during the past few years the amount of training offered has been limited. Furthermore, the board work has been disbanded, meaning that currently there are no persons outside the company on the board who are involved with the development of the company. The idea is to have new members on the board and continue more active board work in the future. There has also been a break in management teamwork, but it has been quite recently started again and the aim is to make it systematic. As a result of the integration, the responsibilities of administrative workers have been broadened.</p>\r\n<p>The integration has required a lot of energy from many workers, but especially from management. The managing director needed to invest a great deal of his time in Hermann&rsquo;s Finland in order to get to know the business and the way of working, integrate all the systems and to change an unprofitable business into a profitable one. This meant that in 2011 Jari Savola was not able to put that much effort into Europlan Engineering Ltd and its turnover remained at lower level than it probably would have been in other circumstances. However, this paid off and the results of Hermann&rsquo;s Finland Ltd were positive apart from the unprofitable old projects.</p>\r\n<p>The new internationalisation strategy was devised after the acquisition and the direction seems to be right. With its own production Europlan Engineering Ltd is able to take care of the project from beginning to end. This is seen as positive by the customers and more profitable for the company as there is no need to buy some of the services outside. Many employees of Europlan Engineering Ltd are currently working abroad and nowadays almost the entire turnover of the company is derived from international projects. International projects are viewed by employees as a pleasant change. However, the whole process is slow: the seeds have just been sown, but no fruits have yet been borne, according to the managing director.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Jari Savola considers the commitment of the management and their ability to secure the support of the employees as the key factor for the successful implementation of the restructurings. In SME restructuring the role of the owner&ndash;manager is greater, whereas in larger companies the owner is in a sense &lsquo;faceless&rsquo;. The board makes the decisions and the personal money of the directors is not involved. In SMEs, management and employees have daily contact and emotions can be involved in these sensitive processes. Also, it might be more difficult for the SMEs to acquire finance. On the other hand, in SMEs the decision-making process is often quicker.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of advice for SMEs buying another company, it was recommended to carry out the due diligence very carefully. Enough time must be invested in it in order to find all possible hidden costs. Tax inspection could be a useful tool in this process.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Elisa Akola, TSE Entre, Turku School of Economics, University of Turku</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>Jari Savola, Managing Director, Chairman of the Board, Europlan Engineering Ltd</p>\r\n<p>Perttu Tuominen, Financial Director, Europlan Engineering Ltd</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company address</strong></p>\r\n<p>Europlan Engineering Ltd</p>\r\n<p>Koppelonkuja 10, 21210 Raisio, Finland</p>\r\n<p><strong>Website of the company</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.europlan.fi/"">http://www.europlan.fi/</a></p>"~"Finland"~"71 - architectural and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"globalisation*recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring*merger / acquisition*relocation"~"2012-03-06"
"Finchemics, Finland"~"Finchemics Ltd"~"<p>Poor financial performance was behind the restructuring of Finnish chemical company Finchemics, a family-run business. Restructuring began with a reformulation of business strategy, which focussed on the development of a new product line. A succession process was instigated, with the CEO moving to become chairman of the board while his son took over as CEO. A third aspect of restructuring was cost-cutting, which involved two rounds of redundancies, as well as temporary layoffs and salary cuts. The restructuring has been tough for the company, and the CEO feels that more should have been achieved.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><b>Organisational profile</b></p>\r\n<p>Finchemics Ltd is a Finnish family company operating in the chemical industry. Established in the early 1900s, Finchemics has played a significant role in the development of the chemical industry in Finland. During its long history, the Finchemics business has taken many forms. At the outset, the company manufactured consumer goods, but in the 1970s and 1980s the focus was on packaging. The 1990s again brought new changes as Finchemics moved into technical contract manufacturing. In the decade leading up to 2012, Finchemics returned to its roots, as consumer goods have become its main business again. In addition to manufacturing consumer goods, Finchemics also carries out some technical contract manufacturing. </p>\r\n<p>The basis for Finchemics’ operations is to design, manufacture, market and deliver goods that satisfy the customer’s needs. The company has no direct rivals in the Finnish market but there are some companies with comparable products. Finchemics’ main business is in Finland but it also has international operations. Imports have accounted for 6% to 10% of Finchemics’ business.</p>\r\n<p>The company is located in southern Finland. Today, the family enterprise is in its fourth generation. The last business transfer process took place in 2011 as the previous CEO stepped aside to be the chairman of the board and his son took his place as CEO. The ownership of Finchemics is divided among four family members. The chairman of the board has the biggest share of the company with an ownership of 35%. His son, the current CEO, owns 20.4% and the rest is divided between the CEO’s aunt and uncle, who are members of the board.  </p>\r\n<p>Finchemics has been involved in different kinds of restructuring during the past few years. In 2011, Finchemics went through a succession process and in 2012 part of the workforce was made redundant while some were temporarily laid off. A business strategy reformulation has also been taking place as Finchemics has been focusing increasingly on design products. The current CEO, incumbent since 2011, has devoted his whole career to Finchemics. He first started working at Finchemics when he was studying for an M.Sc. degree. Now in his thirties, he is in charge of the company. Succession planning was begun by the board of directors as there was a need to develop and renew the board’s work. </p>\r\n<p>There are 31 employees working at Finchemics. The number of employees fell by seven in spring 2012 and it was envisaged that two more employees would be made redundant in autumn 2012. About two-thirds of the employees are white-collar workers and the remaining one-third are blue-collar workers. Half of the employees in the office are women, but only one-quarter of the employees in production are women. When it comes to the age structure, the average age among white-collar workers is 40, while in production among males it is 30–40 years and among females 50–60 years. Such diversity among employees is naturally reflected in the educational backgrounds of the employees: four people have a higher academic degree, some have a college education and some have only completed primary school.</p>\r\n<p>Finchemics is also a member of the industry association. There is no works council present in the company, but there are shop stewards representing the employees. The shop stewards serve as local negotiators, conciliators and channels of communication between the employer and the employees. Shop stewards have been involved in the restructuring procedures related to redundancies and layoffs, as required by the Act on Cooperation Within Undertakings (or <a HREF=""http://www.guidetoworkinginfinland.fi/cms/index.php?yt"">YT Act</a>) applied in all businesses with a regular staff of at least 20 employees in Finland. The relationship between the management and shop stewards was described as open and active. During the cooperation negotiations the management and shop stewards were in daily contact. </p>\r\n<p><b>Background to restructuring events</b></p>\r\n<p>The background to restructuring lies in the firm’s performance. The development of turnover has not been satisfactory according to the company management. The beginning of 2012 was a disappointment for Finchemics whose aim is to grow. Despite slight growth in recent years, this was not sufficient to enable the company to move forward to achieve its goals. In the years 2005 to 2008, company turnover varied from €4 to €4.65 million. However, from 2009 to 2011 Finchemics’ turnover grew from €4.14 to €5.25 million. Despite the turnover remaining stable, the results in certain financial periods have been poor and in 2009 some employees were temporarily laid off. As Finchemics faced new challenges, it became apparent that the company could not go on making temporary savings with short-term layoffs. The decision to lay off part of the workforce was taken for reasons of economy and production. The renewal of the business strategy has been an attempt to improve the financial situation by targeting new markets both nationally and internationally with design products. However, it takes time for the new strategy to start working. At the same time, Finchemics has lost clients in technical manufacturing. There was a clear need to reorganise the cost structure, and redundancies and layoffs were seen as the only sensible solution to the situation. </p>\r\n<p><b>Restructuring processes</b></p>\r\n<p>Three kinds of internal restructuring took place in the company. The first one is related to the reformulation of the business strategy which was started in 2008–2009 and is ongoing. In conjunction with this, it was seen as relevant to start the succession process, the second restructuring, which was implemented at the beginning of 2011. The third form of restructuring, in 2012, related to cost-cuttings, including redundancies, in order to improve the financial situation of the company. </p>\r\n<p>Although improving the profitability of the company was the main trigger for the renewal of the business strategy, environmental issues played a role. For example, the company was not able to compete with Chinese manufacturers due to higher production costs. The idea for reformulating the business strategy came from the board as there was a need to generate added value for consumers with other means than pricing. A new competitive advantage was seen in design products. It was clear that the products have to meet certain standards and appeal to the consumers.</p>\r\n<p>The new product line started with cooperation with a famous Finnish designer in 2008–2009. Finchemics contacted the designer and he was interested in the cooperation. At first, only a few design products were launched and these received a positive reception among customers as well as the designers. Next Finchemics created partnerships with several Finnish designers, who design products for Finchemics. Earlier Finchemics produced a wide range of consumer goods and carried out contract manufacturing. In the new business strategy the company has three product strands: 1) design products; 2) everyday household products; and 3) industrial contract manufacturing. With the design products, Finchemics also aims to grow in international markets. When it comes to contract manufacturing, Finchemics seeks to maintain profitable customers, while cutting the rest away.</p>\r\n<p>The succession process started as a result of a perceived need to develop the board work together with the formulation of the new strategy. There had been talk among the board members that sooner or later some changes would have to be made in order to improve and renew the course of action. In particular, the need for developing the board work became even more topical as the future CEO attended a course called ‘Approved member of the Board’ in 2008. Following completion of the course and in line with the renewal of the business strategy, a succession process took place whereby the CEO was changed at the beginning of 2011. Finchemics’ employees were informed of the succession process and changes in leadership only when the decisions had already been made. The employees’ reactions were hard to describe, according to the CEO, but he concluded that the employees saw that change coming as he worked for the company already some years. Neither trade union nor other actors were informed about this decision but the Finnish business publication <i>Talouselämä</i> covered Finchemics’s leadership changes in a fairly neutral way. </p>\r\n<p>The CEO has not attended leadership training but he has had a tutor to encourage and help him out in different issues regarding leadership. Personal goals for management have been set, job descriptions have been redefined and lots of leadership tools and skills have been taught. Examples of these are the art of giving feedback and development discussions which the CEO has started among the employees. </p>\r\n<p>The third restructuring process at Finchemics related to cost-cutting measures which were necessary in order to save the company from bankruptcy. The board was involved in making the decision about the cost-cutting. In the spring of 2012, the company carried out cooperation negotiations and as a result seven employees were made redundant. In addition, savings were made with temporary layoffs and salary cuts for three employees. The cooperation negotiations, in which the shop stewards were involved, were constructively carried out and in general the employees understood well the situation of the company so the cost-cutting did not cause huge turmoil in the company. In addition to the redundancies and layoffs, the company did not pay any additional holiday pay for the employees in summer 2012 – instead all employees had extra unpaid leave. These cost savings were, however, not sufficient and the company had a second round of cooperation negotiations in autumn 2012, aimed at making two employees redundant and temporarily laying off another two employees. </p>\r\n<p>The actual restructuring was not carried through with excessive planning and timetables. Naturally, the new business strategy was written down, but otherwise no written plans or schedules were made. This seems to be quite common for SMEs that are undertaking restructuring. There was no personnel strategy or social responsibility strategy. And although there were no written documents and no written schedules, it is obvious that some planning had been done. There were some ideas on how the succession would be realised and the same applied to the redundancies. In addition, the need for restructuring had been evident for a long time and many issues surrounding restructuring processes had been discussed. The need to make some staff redundant and lay off others was on the table even before the succession process started. When restructuring was undertaken, other options were not considered too deeply, as it was seen that other options in the end would end up in closure and bankruptcy.</p>\r\n<p><b>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</b></p>\r\n<p>The restructurings, especially the redundancies, have undoubtedly been tough ones. Coming out of a challenging year and stepping into even a more challenging one, the CEO has come to know what it takes to restructure. However, it has also been a learning process. The greatest challenges and bottlenecks in implementing the restructuring have been lack of time and know-how. Progress has been much slower than the company expected and wished for, and the sheer volume of things to take care of has been overwhelming. It is easy to get buried in unfinished work and lose sight of what are the most crucial things to manage in restructurings. The CEO feels that many things have been done somewhat poorly as a result of these pressures. </p>\r\n<p>The succession and strategy restructuring processes themselves were followed through largely as planned but some deviations from the original plans have naturally occurred. For example, when the ownership contract for the CEO was drafted, some things came up that had not been prepared for. These were related mainly to juridical issues. The restructurings have also required financing. The new CEO acquired his shares through a bank loan. </p>\r\n<p><b>Restructuring advice and support</b></p>\r\n<p>Finchemics received public support, both in terms of advice and financial support, in its restructuring. Among the supporting parties were Tekes (Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation) and the Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment. The CEO felt that there were many advisers but not many people he could really count on. He found that while board members were prepared to ‘get their hands dirty’, consultants could sometimes be irritating as they do not necessarily understand what it is like to be in the actual battle. When it comes to financial support, the CEO acknowledged that it was possible to apply for it and sometimes even get it, but applying for different supports has its own costs as well. If a firm is serious about applying for financial support, it often means a great deal of bureaucracy and time spent in making the application. </p>\r\n<p>However, public support has also been beneficial for Finchemics. Loans from Tekes for product development enabled the strategy reformulation and the formulation of mindsets. According to the CEO, the product development loans have been beneficial but the results achieved have not been as positive as he had hoped. The product development loan was received in 2010 to continue working on the new business strategy. The strategy has been in development for three years and still its impacts on company’s result are not as great as the company expected to be. </p>\r\n<p><b>Outcomes of restructuring</b></p>\r\n<p>As a result of the succession process, the current CEO became the successor to his father, as the father moved on to be the chairman of the board. The new CEO took the operational responsibility while the former CEO takes care of things on a broader basis. The succession process and strategy reformulation have so far had some welcome impact on the business of Finchemics: operations have been clarified and objectives have been set at an individual level among the persons in charge. Previously there were no detailed job descriptions available in the company, but objectives and job descriptions have now been set down in detail. Greater attention has also been placed on giving feedback. Based on the feedback received from the employees, job satisfaction has also increased. In addition to these improvements in 2011, both turnover and net return have also increased. </p>\r\n<p>The cost-cuttings – redundancies and layoffs – affected 10 employees in production. The planned redundancies and layoffs will affect the whole company, meaning that employees in marketing and sales might also be let go.</p>\r\n<p>The CEO has mixed feelings about the restructuring that has taken place so far. Finchemics has received positive feedback about new products, new image and overall about the new direction the company is taking. However, when it comes to the succession process and the hard numbers, the CEO feels that more should have been achieved. However, no thorough estimations have been made about the influence of the succession process on Finchemics’ business.</p>\r\n<p>At first the employees reacted with suspicion to the strategic changes. Now they have adapted to these changes and overcome their suspicions, but again as redundancies are announced, commitment and attitudes will naturally get worse again. The truth is that if a company is running out of money something must be done. </p>\r\n<p><b>Commentary</b></p>\r\n<p>The CEO of Finchemics has been guiding the company through turbulent waters ever since he took the job in 2011. First there was the succession process, followed by the strategy change and then the workforce reduction. In the case of Finchemics, it is apparent that restructuring has had more to do with correcting the firm’s direction than preventing different threatening issues. The goal of these corrections was to get the company in a shape where it attracts more growth. </p>\r\n<p>At this point in the restructuring process, some of the unpleasant realities of being an SME become evident. In an SME restructuring, personal relationships are at stake. The SME boss who makes employees redundant is taking jobs away from people he knows, and who know him. The human aspect is much more present in SME restructuring than in restructuring of larger enterprises. Managers in large companies can impose mass redundancies without coming face-to-face with the employees whose jobs are gone. However, SMEs also have some advantages over larger enterprises. The CEO believes that if an SME has the right team leading it, then it can be more flexible and able to follow through restructuring on a shorter time scale. The truth seems to be that SMEs still struggle with inadequate resources and time in the midst of hectic circumstances and larger enterprises might have it better as they may have more adequate resources to do what has to be done. </p>\r\n<p>In the CEO’s experience the most important thing in managing restructurings is to have enough time to take the organisation through the change process. Know-how and experience are massive assets in restructuring situations. The more qualified the team is, the fewer mistakes are made and the less time is wasted. Other issues that the CEO gives attention to are the need for planning, coming up with a realistic schedule and being serious about both budgeted expenses and expected returns. </p>\r\n<p>If the CEO had the chance to carry out the restructuring again, he would do some things differently. Instead of trying to renew too many things at the same time, he would focus on a few key issues instead. In other words, he would slow down the pace of restructuring and make sure that the basics were given enough time. </p>\r\n<p><i>Authors’ note:</i> Finchemics Ltd is not the real name of the company.

"First Credit, Ireland"~"First Credit"~NULL~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>John McGuire incorporated First Credit as a limited liability company, FCMB Limited, on 10 May 2002. He was the sole shareholder in the company and as Irish company law requires that a company should have two directors, his father, a school headmaster, was the second director. His father has no real involvement in the running of the company.</p>\r\n<p>The first objective of FCMB Limited – which trades under the name of First Credit –  was mortgages and life assurance.</p>\r\n<p>John McGuire was 29 years old when he established First Credit. His first job on leaving secondary education was in a commercial insurance broker’s (a commercial insurance broker mainly sells insurance policies to businesses) but this only lasted four months as he was dismissed because his employer said he was not applying himself enough. He quickly found employment in another insurance broker’s but the episode had a major impact on his attitude to work.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to establishing First Credit, he spent a number of months researching ideas for a business before concluding that the provision of mortgages represented the best market opportunity. He set up the company with €40,000 in capital and a €20,000 overdraft. Between the ages of 19 and 28 years when John McGuire was working in insurance brokering, he was also involved in developing land and in purchasing property. He used the proceeds from the sale of one his properties to fund the establishment of First Credit.</p>\r\n<p>He was the company’s only employee in the initial period and it took some time for sales to build up before he needed to take on employees. Sales were initially slow because he had no prior experience of the mortgage brokering business and therefore had no customer base to draw upon. Word of mouth was an important means of spreading awareness of First Credit. John McGuire’s innovative marketing strategy in 2006 of offering fixed legal fees in respect of mortgages taken out by borrowers helped to attract customers at a time when legal costs were a significant burden for home purchasers.</p>\r\n<p>In the early years of First Credit, John McGuire relied heavily on the services of an external management accountant to guide him in relation to costs.</p>\r\n<p>First Credit initially started in a small office and then moved to a larger office nearby before John McGuire purchased as a private investment (that is separately from First Credit) the building in Upper Pembroke Street – close to Dublin’s city centre – in which First Credit and his other companies (see below) are now based.</p>\r\n<p>First Credit benefited from the boom in the Irish property sector and five years after incorporation was organising more than €130 million in mortgages a year and was making more than €1.4 million in gross profit. John McGuire took more or less everything out of the company including an annual salary of €300,000 and rental income of €200,000 due to him being the company’s landlord.</p>\r\n<p>Employment in First Credit grew rapidly and by 2007 18 people were employed in the company. The majority of employees were men in their early 20s, most of whom had a background in financial services. The two main staff categories were sales and administration. The employees were not members of any trade union.</p>\r\n<p>John McGuire took advantage of the profits generated by First Credit and the opportunities arising from the fast-growing Irish economy to invest in new businesses and in property. In his own words: ‘I had just invested in two new companies, I had a net worth of €10 million and I was making a decent year’s salary every month’.</p>\r\n<p>His first new business was Pembroke Insurances, established in 2006. Its main business is the provision of insurances policies to the business sector. The second new business, Quote Devil (<a HREF=""www.quotedevil.ie"">www.quotedevil.ie</a>), was set up in 2007 to market insurance products via the web.</p>\r\n<p>He also invested in property including one site in Ballsbridge, an upmarket location close to the city centre. He purchased this investment – which had the potential to be used as his residence – without the aid of a bank loan; he used the proceeds from the sale of his holiday home in Dubai to fund it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>First Credit’s main activity before the restructuring event was as a mortgage broker for first-time house buyers. The company facilitated borrowers to source mortgages from financial institutions and was a one-stop-shop advising on all the steps involved. Through a sub-brand, Remortgage Plus, it also assisted borrowers to re-mortgage their loans, that is, to consolidate all their outstanding loans into one loan.</p>\r\n<p>During the period 2000–2008 (known as the ‘Irish property bubble’), the demand for mortgages in Ireland grew rapidly. However, from 2007 onwards the mortgage broker industry was significantly – and negatively – impacted by a number of factors. A significant contributing factor was the extent of over-lending by Irish financial institutions to the property market which became apparent in 2007–2008 and ultimately resulted in the nationalisation of virtually all of the Irish-owned banks. Additionally, the collapse of the US investment bank, Lehman Brothers, in 2008 was a major shock to the international financial service sector and resulted in restrictions on wholesale bank lending – on which Irish financial institutions relied greatly as a source for funding. </p>\r\n<p>The decision of the banks in Ireland to scale back on their lending – and in particular lending to the property sector – had disastrous consequences for mortgage brokers such as First Credit. Mortgage brokers, even if they had customers with good credit ratings, were unable to source mortgage finance from the banks.</p>\r\n<p>The collapse of the Irish property bubble had other complications. Falling property prices meant that thousands of new homeowners were now faced with the prospect of negative equity: mortgage debt exceeding the value of the property. This also stopped the mortgage refinancing market in its tracks. </p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the property bubble had created thousands of jobs in the construction sector and with falling property prices, activity in the sector ground to a halt and construction companies started to lay off staff. Furthermore, as the government had been over-reliant on revenues generated from the sales of properties as a source of revenue, when construction-related tax receipts fell, Ireland’s fiscal deficit widened significantly.</p>\r\n<p>Though initially the real culprit was the refusal of the banks to provide mortgages, the recession also caused a decline in the demand for mortgages by consumers. In his book, <i>Sorted!</i>, John McGuire describes the impact:</p>\r\n<BLOCK-QUOTE><p>\r\n<i>I was shocked in October 2008 when, along with many of\r\nyou, I watched stock markets, pension funds, and everything else get\r\nannihilated. October 2008 was when the phone stopped ringing in my company, but\r\nit was in 2009, when it really hit the fan, that the business really stopped\r\nturning and the cash reserves started to run\r\nout.</i> </p></BLOCK-QUOTE><p>At one stage during 2009, John McGuire was putting €25,000 a month into the company to pay employees’ salaries. He continued to put his own money into the company during 2009 as he felt the downturn in the demand for mortgages was going to be temporary.</p>\r\n<p>In 2010, he realised that the new economic conditions were not temporary, but permanent. There would be no market for mortgages and, as a result, the business model on which First Credit was based was obsolete.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>During the initial stages of the restructuring process which started in late 2008, John McGuire put a considerable amount of his own cash into First Credit in order to pay the salaries of employees.</p>\r\n<p>Around this time too, one of First Credit’s main competitors, Rea Mortgages, went into liquidation. John McGuire says that the owner of the Rea Mortgages had saved himself a lot of pain by going into liquidation early rather than enduring the slow, dragged-out death that other mortgage brokers experienced.</p>\r\n<p>John McGuire’s main challenge of the restructuring process was to deal with the declining market for mortgage brokering while at the same time take advantage of opportunities in other markets such as the sale of commercial and personal insurance policies. However, his main focus during 2009 and 2010 was survival. His survival plan – an overall plan that was flexible to change depending on circumstances – involved gambling on his two new companies (Pembroke and Quote Devil) and two property sites that he knew would eventually be profitable. However, he faced a double-bind: his main operating company, First Credit, was losing money on a monthly basis while his new businesses were in the start-up phase with no revenues being generated. </p>\r\n<p>He needed the companies to be profitable so that they could pay him rent for the use of his building in Upper Pembroke Street. He needed this income to make his loan repayments – if he didn’t, it would be all over. Realising that he had little prospect of finding a buyer if he were to put the property up for sale — there was even less property finance available for commercial land as the market had fallen 705–80% — and in an effort to generate additional rental income, he decided to set up a café/bar in the basement of the building. The company, Dax Café Bar, established to run the new venture was incorporated in 2009. He used the proceeds from the sale of his car and some of the money from the sale of his holiday home to finance the building works at Pembroke Street and at his property in Ballsbridge which cost over €1 million in total.</p>\r\n<p>He had to decide if he should liquidate First Credit or keep going. He was conscious that First Credit had very loyal staff but he was equally aware that the company was losing more money than it was generating. He was dipping into his savings to pay for the shortfall in revenues.</p>\r\n<p>First Credit’s employees were fully aware of the difficulties faced by the company: they could see that the banks were not lending money for mortgages and that consumers were becoming increasingly reluctant to borrow money for a major purchase such as a house at a time when unemployment was rising and interest rates were increasing. The employees also saw that First Credit had stopped advertising and that the company’s ranking on major search engines was falling.</p>\r\n<p>During the restructuring process, staff salaries within First Credit were cut (ultimately by 30%) and additionally, because of the downturn in business, none of the sales staff were receiving commissions. Employees experienced delays in getting their salaries. One by one, his staff resigned from the company; they left of their own accord – there were no redundancies. </p>\r\n<p>In his book, John McGuire describes the relief when the very last employee left. It meant that he would not have to draw upon his savings to pay the employee’s monthly salary. For a short period during 2010, John McGuire was the only person working in First Credit.</p>\r\n<p>In hindsight, John McGuire wonders whether it would have been more beneficial to have made employees redundant and thereby not have to work in the very tense and difficult atmosphere within the company. On the other hand, he says that jobs in the financial services sector were difficult to find and his employees might have had to face the dole for a couple of months before finding new employment. He says that it is easier to find a job if you are already in a job so the fact that First Credit kept the employees in employment may have made it easier for them to find work elsewhere.</p>\r\n<p>Consultation with employees was not a feature of First Credit’s modus operandi though it was obvious to the employees that the company was in trouble (firstly, no bank was lending money for mortgages and, secondly, there was little demand for mortgages on the part of borrowers). Though it was not officially spoken about within the company, staff became aware of the money John McGuire was personally putting into the company because their salary cheques came from his personal account. They knew too that First Credit’s advertising budget had been cut which, as mentioned previously, meant that the company’s ranking on search engines fell. Realising the very serious situation facing the company, the employees participated in initiatives to reduce costs, for example sourcing cheaper stationery items. As time progressed, it became evident to the employees that John McGuire’s entrepreneurial energies were being directed towards his other enterprises and not First Credit.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to his problems with First Credit, John McGuire had to contend with difficulties in his other ventures. The bank that had lent him money to develop his Ballsbridge site pulled the funding, leaving him essentially with a large hole in the ground that was worth nothing. There were problems too obtaining planning permission to develop his new café/bar venture.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>John McGuire says in his book that had he merely been an employee of First Credit rather than its owner he would have left the company much sooner – a mortgage broker fighting for survival was not the most pleasant place to be.</p>\r\n<p>He debated whether he should make his staff redundant or try to hold onto them for as long as possible. In the end, his employees made the decision for him by resigning. One employee characterised the situation facing staff as being like a passenger on the <i>Titanic</i> (‘do I jump or do I stay on board?’).</p>\r\n<p>The main issue faced by First Credit and other mortgage brokers from 2008 onwards was the unwillingness of the banks to provide mortgage finance, even in cases where the applicant had a good financial track record. Then, the full extent of the recession kicked in with the result that consumers scaled back their purchases of homes and property. The situation was compounded by tensions between the two government parties over how to respond to the economic and financial crisis.</p>\r\n<p>John McGuire initially took the view during 2007–2008 that the economic downturn was going to be temporary (he had even been considering an expansion path for First Credit). Then the full extent of the financial, economic and political meltdown in Ireland became apparent and was given full realisation with the signing of the bailout agreement in November 2010 between Ireland and the EU and International Monetary Fund. A general election held three months later in February 2011 resulted in a heavy defeat for the two government parties.</p>\r\n<p>It was only when it became apparent that not only was the downturn not temporary but in fact it was going to get much worse, that John McGuire decided to run down First Credit and focus on his two new insurance-related ventures, Pembroke Insurances and Quote Devil, which had future potential and unlike the mortgage finance business were largely repeat business. He said that all his creative energy went into these two ventures because they represented his future. Both sold standard insurance products which, unlike mortgages, had to be renewed annually: that is, they were repeat business products. His other investment, Dax Café Bar, was also important to him as a source of rental income for his building.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>John McGuire did not have access to state supports such as advice or financial assistance from Enterprise Ireland, the SME national support agency or any other agency. None of his other businesses have received support from state agencies.</p>\r\n<p>He said that he did not know where or to which organisation he could have turned to for help with his restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>In the early years of First Credit, John McGuire relied on his management accountant for advice. However, he was irked by the fact that during the post-2008 crisis, even though First Credit was in decline, his management accountant did not reduce his fees, and so he decided to dispense with his services.</p>\r\n<p>First Credit was involved in an industry group, AMG Group, set up in 2008 by independent mortgage brokers to respond to the banks’ decision to reduce the availability of mortgages. This group allowed for an exchange of ideas regarding the difficulties that mortgage brokers were experiencing at the time, particularly in relation to dealing with the banks. John McGuire participated in the group for approximately one year but left when he realised that there was no future for First Credit as a mortgage broker.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The outcomes of the restructuring of First Credit are that it has considerably reduced its numbers of employees and it now no longer specialises in mortgages. First Credit currently has one full-time staff member who was recruited in late 2010 and who concentrates on the selling of life insurance policies; its trading name has been changed to First Credit Assurance. The company is generating a small profit, primarily because it only has one salary to pay; however, it is still carrying forward substantial losses from previous years.</p>\r\n<p>John McGuire did not make any of his 18 staff in First Credit redundant. He decided he would make sure that there would be jobs for everyone who stuck with him; however, in hindsight, he says he could have given them a cash lump sum and let them find alternative employment. </p>\r\n<p>A number of the staff who left First Credit found employment in other financial institutions while others are believed to have emigrated.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to the restructuring of First Credit, John McGuire had established a commercial insurance brokerage, Pembroke Insurances, and an online low-cost car, van, home and health insurance business, Quote Devil. The latter business now already has over 10,000 customers and is trading profitably. He has also opened a new bar, Dax Café Bar, which is based in First Credit’s old boardroom.</p>\r\n<p>The property sites that he purchased during the property boom were completed and are now generating rental income for him.</p>\r\n<p>Through his new businesses, John McGuire now employs 40 people and expects that number to grow by an additional 25 jobs.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to point out that though First Credit now only employs one person and focuses on assurance products, John McGuire is considering a project that might involve a return to the mortgage market. He believes this new project, if brought to fruition, could have the potential to significantly transform the fortunes of First Credit.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>This is the case study of a company whose product simply disappeared overnight because of the refusal of the banks, as a consequence of the financial markets crisis in 2008, to provide mortgage finance. First Credit had grown from one employee to 18 by 2007 but as firstly the supply of mortgage finance dried up and secondly consumers scaled back on their demand for mortgages, its sales declined. The owner of First Credit, John McGuire, continued to pay employee salaries from his own personal savings until, one by one, they all left the company. </p>\r\n<p>The company now employs one full-time employee and its focus is on selling life insurance policies. John McGuire is considering a new venture that could see the return of First Credit to the mortgage market and has the potential to significantly transform the fortunes of the company. </p>\r\n<p>The company did not seek external help with its difficulties; in any case, John McGuire says he did not know who he could have turned to for assistance.</p>\r\n<p>Though he parted company during the crisis with the external management accountant he had relied upon during First Credit’s formative years, he believes it is important that enterprises facing a restructuring should have up-to-date information on their financial health.</p>\r\n<p>In retrospect, he says he should have considered liquidating the company and making the employees redundant: this would have allowed him to safeguard his cash reserves for other opportunities. However, the scale and intensity of the financial and economic crisis did not become apparent for some time; he, along with other Irish entrepreneurs, thought that the downturn was temporary (‘a blip’) but soon came to realise that not only was it permanent, it was likely to get even worse.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Tom Martin, Tom Martin &amp; Associates (TMA)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>John McGuire (2012), <i>Sorted!

"GC, Romania"~"GC"~"<p>When the construction bubble burst in 2009, restructuring became unavoidable for this Romanian wholesaler and retailer of construction materials. A number of retail spaces were closed, which led to almost 10% of the workforce having to either be relocated to other retail locations or production facilities or to be let go. For staff who were retained, salaries were cut or frozen; some had to take unpaid leave for one or two weeks at a time. The best way to maintain motivation among the staff, according to the owner-manager, was keeping them apprised of his efforts to avoid further staff reductions.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The company GC<b> </b> is located in Ramnicu Valcea, west of Bucharest. Its main activities are selling construction materials either wholesale or retail. The company was set up by ‘Mr P’ in 1999. It employs 100 people in different business areas, the two main ones being retail and production. There is no works council. The management structure is very simple. Mr P is the final decision-maker on all costs and payment-related issues. There are heads of businesses and of teams but they cannot take decisions about finances, hiring and firing, the suppliers of goods and services or prices of own goods and services. </p>\r\n<p>The business has developed by following market trends. For example, Mr P entered the construction business when he observed the booming construction sector. </p>\r\n<p>GC<b> </b> sells construction materials, electrical appliances, kitchen fixtures, furniture, double-glazed windows and window frames. </p>\r\n<p>Mr P is 35 years old and has been an entrepreneur all his life. He started the company to meet a growing need in a bullish economy. It was a time when Romanians were making their first ventures into credit loans and when they wanted to own their houses. Building their own house was one of the preferred options.</p>\r\n<p>Mr P discovered this demand very early. At first the company sold fittings for kitchen and bathrooms. Then construction material and double-glazed windows and frames were added. As mentioned above, the dynamics of the company were dictated by the market dynamics. Mr P did not follow one single business line – it just went according to what was profitable at the time. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>Although Mr P was very good at spotting the development of the construction sector related to the development of the mortgage market, he was not able to predict the end of the boom. The 2009 recession found Mr P during an expansion phase as he was investing in new retail spots and hiring new personnel. </p>\r\n<p>The fall of the construction market for housing was swift and sharp. Even in 2012 the sector was still searching for the bottom. </p>\r\n<p>Another problem was the concentration of the business on only one market: housing and house remodelling. Thus Mr P had to react very fast to the changing realities of his business, especially as close to 100 people were depending on him. Unfortunately, there was no way to avoid the introduction of a tough restructuring programme. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>All the investment decisions and programmes that were decided in 2008 had to be revised. The restructuring plans were divided into two: measures that could be implemented immediately and measures that would be implemented throughout 2009 and maybe 2010. </p>\r\n<p>It was obvious at the beginning of 2009 that some of the investment plans had to stop immediately. Mr P first tried to exit rent contracts for new retail spaces that were not yet developed. Then he looked at his inventories and made a plan to identify if any of the materials could be sold to a market like Turkey, where the construction market was still growing. </p>\r\n<p>At the same time Mr P looked at his retail spaces that were already established. Together with his senior management, he chose which of them they would keep and decided to close the others. To make this decision, he looked at overall profitability of individual location, number of employees, proximity to main shopping areas and, probably most importantly, the cost of renting. This decision led to almost 10% of his workforce having to either be relocated to other retail locations or production facilities or to be let go. </p>\r\n<p>To decide on which personnel to be made redundant, Mr P looked at the most profitable locations and identified which ones could accommodate one or two more employees. He determined that around 15 people from production who were supposed to leave could be employed in other parts of the company. For the other five people, Mr P negotiated a severance package comprising, from case to case, depending on experience and years within the company, one or two months’ salary above the one month salary required by the law. </p>\r\n<p>At the same time Mr P was trying to find places for the people working in the retail stores in other departments of the company. Of course, not all staff could be saved, and some of the personnel were dismissed with a severance package. </p>\r\n<p>The employees who had to move to other areas of the company were informed by their immediate superior. However, Mr P said that he personally informed the people who had to be fired. </p>\r\n<p>For the reassigned staff, there was a short half-day training regarding the products that they would sell in the retail stores. </p>\r\n<p>As the fall of the construction market was so dramatic, more had to be done to keep the company profitable in the long run. Mr P had to freeze and cut some salaries for the rest of the employees. At first he froze salaries for the second part of 2009 but, as this was not enough, he negotiated a 15% salary reduction for the whole of 2010. In some cases, especially during the winter period, the people working on the side of the business connected to the construction sector had to take unpaid leave for one or two weeks at a time. There were 45 employees in this unpaid leave programme. At the same time, Mr P renegotiated the acquisition prices for his inventories and new products, and also asked for a longer period to pay the suppliers. Negotiating lower prices and costs is tough but Mr P felt that during 2010 all these adjustments were easier to implement. He felt that the counterparties also had an active interest in keeping him as a client and were more willing to accept worse conditions than previously agreed. </p>\r\n<p>Mr P explained that he felt 2009–2010 was a period of just cutting and negotiating. And even then it would not be enough to make the company profitable. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Throughout the restructuring process, Mr P had to ensure that his staff remained motivated and that he made the payments to his creditors and suppliers. When asked about what he did differently to motivate his people during the crisis, Mr P replied that he didn’t do too much. He had to keep paying the salaries in time, added a few more meetings with his senior staff to update them on the new contracts or upcoming deals and asked them to pass the information as soon as possible to the rest of the workers. The best motivation came from his efforts to keep the jobs in place and not to be forced to further reduce the number of his employees. He made sure that this message reached the employees constantly. Also, getting out of lease contracts for retail spaces proved almost impossible in those times and it came at a cost. The situation improved from his point of view for contracts in the latter part of 2009 and throughout 2010 when it was obvious that the construction and real estate market would not recover any time soon. </p>\r\n<p>To this cost was added also the cost of severance packages for the people he could not retain. To pay for the severance package, Mr P contracted a short-term loan from a local bank, which he paid back in 2011. To get the loan Mr P met with five banks, all of them ranked among the top 10 banks in Romania by asset size. Unfortunately, none of them was able to give him a deal that he could afford. In fact, four out of the five banks did not present an offer as his company was seen as a risky one due to its reliance on the construction sector. In the end, it was the sixth bank that gave him the loan. It was a small bank used to dealing with SMEs similar to GC.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, another constraint was the high inventory, construction materials and fixtures that he had accumulated in 2008, based on the 2008 turnover numbers. Unfortunately some of the inventory is still there today but Mr P had to pay for it in 2009.</p>\r\n<p>However, in the last months of 2011 and at the beginning of 2012 Mr P sold 80% of the old inventory. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Mr P did not use any restructuring advice or support. Mr P said that he could not afford the advice of a consultant. He also said that he does not see the point, as at first he would have had to explain his business to the consultant, which would have taken time. In his view, it was better for the company if he used this time to solve the problems himself. Also, he does not think that he will use outside help in the future if a similar situation will arise. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>GC saw the same meteoric rise as the other companies in the construction business. The restructuring has been long and in some respects it is still continuing today.</p>\r\n<p>But as other similar companies disappeared, Mr P managed to turn his company around in 2011 after two really tough years. In 2011 he managed to increase salaries again and registered a profit. The turnover is not at the 2008 level but Mr P is expecting it to be at that level in a few years. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Mr P’s management style resembles the style of the majority of managers in Romania, in both small and large companies. As this business was not his lifelong dream, Mr P was always guided by the market. Thus, when business was good, Mr P hired more people than he actually needed as he was hiring for his future plans not current needs. However, when things slowed down he did not shy away from restructuring personnel or from shifting staff within the company.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was long and complicated for a small company but Mr P was more than capable of managing it. It is also interesting to see that he did not have any problems with the staff he let go and those that were relocated were more than happy to just keep their jobs. </p>\r\n<p>Mr P shows that even without formal training the survival instinct led him to the right decisions for his company and employees.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Florin Citu, GEA Strategy and Consulting</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interview </b></p>\r\n<p>Mr P, owner and manager of GC</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Romania"~"46 - wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles"~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"internal restructuring"~"2011-09-29"
"H&D, Czech Republic"~"H&D, a.s."~"<p>Czech textile firm H&D decided to offshore production to China because of increasingly high labour costs in the Czech Republic, which made the firm less competitive. This way of optimising costs was sought as it was assumed that the competition in the industry will further increase due to the introduction of vertical production chains and the weaker negotiation power of SMEs (compared with larger firms) towards suppliers.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The joint-stock company H&amp;D a.s. is a clothing manufacturing company. Originally established as a cooperative association in 1990, it was transformed into a joint-stock company in 1995. Ivo Havel, who is the company’s current director, privatised the state-owned Galeko a.s. Prostějov within the voucher privatisation programme and then purchased the majority share in that company (voucher privatisation is a privatisation method where citizens are given or sold a book of vouchers which represents potential shares in any state-owned company.). Today Mr Havel and his wife are the sole owners of the company. In this way, Mr Havel obtained the current premises of the company, as well as two retail networks of the Oděvy Hradec Králové and Oděvy České Budějovice companies which used to be parts of the state-owned Galeko a.s. Prostějov. Gradually, all the shops of the two above-mentioned companies were sold out as a consequence of declining sales.</p>\r\n<p>As far as the manufacture of clothing is concerned, between 1995 and 1997 the company had eight separate operations with approximately 40 employees each. In 2012, they have only one workshop with 10 people. Starting in 1994, all production operations were gradually relocated to Southeast Asia. Due to ever-increasing pressure in the textile industry, the company has been progressively changing its focus since 2008 and is shifting to the manufacture of home accessories and furniture marketed under the H&amp;D Home Design brand. Nevertheless, the manufacture of clothing still makes up the majority of operations. The company currently has two brand-name shops in Prague and Prostějov and two Internet shops (one selling clothing and the other furniture and home accessories). In addition, the company runs its own guest house in the Jeseník Mountains.</p>\r\n<p>When it was first established, H&amp;D had 400 employees. With the passage of time, as more and more production activities were relocated to Southeast Asia, the employee headcount decreased (the company had 180 employees in 2004, 150 by 2006, 75 by 2008 and only 65 by 2010). At the beginning of 2012, the company had 45 employees in total in the production division (only a minor share of the employment as the employees focus only on the repair of imported furniture and clothing, not on their production), the creative division, the furniture and textile warehouse, and the accounting department. Other than the designers and top management, who have university degrees, the majority of the employees have completed a vocational education. The company does not have a documented human resource development strategy or a social responsibility strategy. There are no works council and no trade union in the company.</p>\r\n<p>Ivo Havel, who is a qualified engineer, is the company’s owner and director. He has abundant experience of the textile production industry. For many years, he was the deputy director of the state-owned OP Prostějov s.p. clothing manufacturer. After the change of regime in 1989, he was the director of the state-owned Gala Company for a short time. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Havel classifies the company as an international enterprise, not only because it outsources production to China, but due to its export activities. The METRO Group, which is represented in the European Union, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Greece, Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria and Hungary, is the main export intermediary. The company exports 40% of its total production volume through this chain. Only a minimum of production output is purchased locally.</p>\r\n<p>Starting in about 2000, the company’s annual turnover was approximately CZK 200 million (€8 million). The maximum turnover was achieved in 2008, when it reached CZK 275 million (€11 million). Since that time it has been decreasing – it was CZK 140 million (€5.6 million) in 2009, CZK 98 million (€3.9 million) in 2010, and in 2011, it was only CZK 90 million (€3.6 million, including VAT).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>The main initiating factor behind the restructuring changes that required the offshoring of production to China is the high cost of labour for line production. As an example, Mr Havel described the situation of the Czech Republic, when in 2004 the personnel costs for one employee were approximately USD 200 (€160) per month. Due to increasing wages and the weakening of the dollar in relation to the Czech crown, these costs have increased to USD 600 (€490). As a result, the workforce lost its competitive strength in comparison to countries such as China. The company began outsourcing the production of its products to China in 1994 and all of its production operations have gradually transferred there. In Prostějov, where the company is situated, their products are only designed. </p>\r\n<p>Although the company had a record turnover in 2008, the management was certain that the competition in the textile industry would continue to intensify, particularly due to the arrival of vertical production chains – international chains that sell their products in their own international retail networks, but do not purchase their product portfolio but produce it themselves in countries with lower labour costs, for example H&amp;M, Kik, C&amp;A, and Inditex, which operates stores such as Berschka, Massimo Dutti and others – in the Czech Republic. When ordering production in Asia, medium-sized enterprises do not have as strong a negotiating position as large companies and thus cannot attain the same level of quantity discounts. According to Mr Havel, China is currently also becoming expensive and Mr Havel is looking for somewhere else to relocate his sewing shops, possibly to Bangladesh. </p>\r\n<p>2010 was the most difficult year in H&amp;D’s history due to the confluence of several negative factors. In addition to the overall global crisis, which was reflected in a decrease in consumption and consequently in the demand for the company’s products and reduced deliveries to hypermarkets, other negative trends also started to appear. The first was a continual increase in the price of cotton on the world’s markets. The company, as a manufacturer of leisure clothing, uses primarily cotton or cotton blend materials. Another negative factor was the increase in costs associated with production in China due to the reduction in subsidies provided by the Chinese government for the export of textiles. This was combined with an increase in the wages paid to workers in this industry. All of the above were reflected in increased costs associated with the manufacture of clothing.</p>\r\n<p>As a reaction to the decreasing sales in clothing, due to the very capable and experienced employees in the import section (they have language skills, knowledge about corresponding legislation, established contacts), Mr Havel decided to look for new import opportunities in order to diversify the production of the company.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes </h2>\r\n<p>As a result of various influences on the competitiveness mentioned above, in 2010 the company was forced to implement measures aimed at creating internal sources of cost savings. These measures included increasing the effectiveness of production outsourcing management, primarily in the phase during which all of the components required for the manufacturing process are ordered and completed. </p>\r\n<p>Another measure used to counterbalance the pressure in the textile industry was to gradually diversify production and to shift from the manufacture of clothing to the manufacture of furniture and home accessories. For these reasons, the company has been undergoing an internal restructuring process since the autumn of 2008 in relation to the portfolio of products it manufactures. The company is gradually changing its focus and is shifting to the manufacture of home accessories and furniture manufactured under the H&amp;D Home Design brand. The competition is not as stiff within this particular segment as it is in the clothing industry – in 2011 the sales of furniture and home furnishings accounted for a turnover of CZK 15 million (€600,000), as compared to CZK 7 million (€280,000) in 2010. The original focus on retail sales of this particular group of products has thus far not generated any significant results. For this reason, the company would like to become a supplier for hotels, restaurants, golf clubs, spas and bakeries.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to changing its product portfolio, the company also attempted to decrease its overhead costs. It installed more energy-efficient lighting and other measures to decrease the overall use of energy. </p>\r\n<p>As far as the restructuring period is concerned, according to Mr Havel it is still underway. The share contributed to turnover by furniture has been increasing continually since 2008, to the detriment of clothing. In the case of off-the-rack clothing, the volume is becoming lower and lower and the company recently abandoned the manufacture of women’s off-the-rack clothing because of weak demand. The volume of clothing produced develops according to demands of clients of the company. In a case of urgent demand for clothing the company is prepared to increase its production.</p>\r\n<p>The company has never had – and still does not have – any cohesive restructuring plan. However, for the purpose of receiving bank credit, it must prepare two-year business plans. According to Mr Havel, these two-year plans are sufficient. He claims that, within the textile industry, it is not worthwhile to plan for a longer timeframe due to the rapid ageing of production. The situation with furniture is different – it has a longer physical and functional useful life. In addition to Mr Havel, the company’s sales director and financial analyst also participate in decision-making about restructuring issues.</p>\r\n<p>The business strategy to move to a different product portfolio originated gradually. At various trade fairs that Mr Havel visited in Southeast Asia (Shanghai, Canton, Djakarta, Singapore, New Delhi, Dhaka and Taipei), he established contacts with furniture manufacturers. Within the company itself, the restructuring did not require any major measures to be implemented. No special machines had to be bought as the production has been outsourced to China. The company only hired two furniture experts, specifically one designer and one cabinet maker. The other employees were retrained. This was easy because the main principles of their work remain the same and only the object of business has changed. The retraining was announced to employees just at the beginning of this restructuring process. The employees accepted the retraining as they saw that the competition in the clothing industry was getting more intensive, which threatened their jobs. The creative division changed its focus from fashion to furniture and home accessories. In the case of the internet shops, the company hired software specialists. </p>\r\n<p>Approximately 135 employees have been made redundant since 1994 as a consequence of outsourcing the production to China. In the period of internal restructuring (2008–2012) the number of employees decreased by 30; however, it was mostly associated with the continuing outsourcing of production. Firstly the workers who were employed in other companies’ activities were made redundant. The selection of employees who became unemployed was made according to the needs of company as the effectiveness of the production had to be maintained. However, Mr Havel maintained the jobs of hardworking lone parents whose redundancies would have exposed them to a very difficult situation. The dismissal was announced to all relevant workers in advance. All the dismissed workers got severance pay according to law.  </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring steps were financed from the company’s own resources and with the use of the company’s existing revolving credit account (the limit is CZK 10 million (approximately €400,000), but the average outstanding debt is approximately CZK 5 million (€200,000)). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>When evaluating restructuring activities from the perspective of small and medium-sized enterprises, Mr Havel believes that the restructuring of the product portfolio is more complex than the restructuring of other areas, mainly because it requires great support in the form of human resources, which small and medium-sized enterprises generally do not have. From the viewpoint of H&amp;D, this was especially valid concerning the transformation of the company’s product portfolio. This transformation required especially capable designers and it was hard to find them. If Mr Havel could turn back the clock and perform the restructuring process again, he would hire a personnel officer, as he was not successful in finding high-quality employees for the position of designer quickly enough. At the same time, a high-quality workforce plays a decisive role in the success of every company. In this respect, Mr Havel draws attention to the weak position of small and medium-sized enterprises, which cannot afford to pay for ads on the large job portals such as www.jobs.cz.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, small and medium-sized enterprises are more flexible but, at the same time, also place greater demands on a flexible workforce. As an example, Mr Havel specified that during the restructuring period, he changed the job descriptions of two or three people every month.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Mr Havel did not feel the need to receive any significant level of support during the restructuring process. He continues to feel this way even looking back in retrospect. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Mr Havel hopes that the restructuring is going smoothly – as the restructuring is not yet complete, he hopes that it will, in due course, speed up the rate of return for the furniture portfolio. Although the company does not have an official restructuring plan, it has an ISO certificate, and the annual recertification requirement provides the initiative to evaluate production processes and redefine them as required.</p>\r\n<p>The impact of internal restructuring on employment is not clear as it is hard to distinguish it from the impact on employment associated with the offshoring of clothing production to China. This kind of restructuring, which started in 1994, has had a significant influence on the employment. The employee headcount in the clothing production division has decreased as a result (180 employees in 2004, 65 in 2010, 45 in 2012). Concerning the period of the internal restructuring (approximately 2008–2012), the number of employees decreased fell by 30. Some redundancies were made by stopping other activities of the company such as security guards and canteen staff, or by restructuring the operation of boiling room. However, most of the redundancies were made in the clothing and furniture warehouse. The company’s employee headcount also reduced naturally to a large degree as employees retired. Mr Havel estimates that the share of those who left voluntarily was about 50% of the total number of employees who were made redundant. There were no redundancies in the business department, which is very important as a support for the import activities. The company did not hire any new production workers for six years. If any were hired, it was only for a limited period of time.</p>\r\n<p>The dismissal preceded redeployment. Mr Havel specified that during the restructuring period, he changed the job descriptions of two or three people every month and by some of them even repeatedly (therefore it is hard to give a concrete number for employees redeployed). Such frequent changes naturally annoyed employees; they felt uncertainty and needed to struggle with new tasks. However they tried to adapt to such changes in order to maintain their jobs in a region where the unemployment rate was 9.8% at the end of 2012.</p>\r\n<p>Taking into account the fact that the importance of the production operations is already minimal in Prostějov, this decrease in employment will probably stop and the number of employees will stabilise. Nevertheless, as Mr Havel noted, in the current turbulent period it is not easy to predict the business performance, especially with respect to unstable exchange rates of dollar and euro. </p>\r\n<p>From the perspective of the company’s employees, the restructuring events did not have any significant effect on the length of working hours or on the organisation of labour. Mr Havel believes that the internal restructuring and the change in the product portfolio increased their uncertainty. On the other hand, however, employees in a region with a high unemployment rate (where another important clothing manufacturer, OP Prostějov, has already shut down) place a higher value on their jobs.</p>\r\n<p>As far as the company’s turnover is concerned, thus far the restructuring measures have not yet brought the desired key effect with regard to increasing turnover. On the other hand, the reduction in turnover from the clothing line is gradually being replaced by increased turnover from the furniture and home accessory product lines. This is another key objective for the future – to expand trading with household textiles, home accessories and furniture (currently the share held by furniture is growing by approximately 30% annually).</p>\r\n<p>Lenka Kolářová (female, aged 39), who has been employed at the company for four years, described the changes related to the restructuring processes from the employees’ point of view. She is a good example of how important a flexible workforce is for small companies. She started out in the returned textiles department, moved on to the materials warehouse, and is now a warehouse employee in the Home Design Section.  </p>\r\n<p>Mrs Kolářová has experienced both the company’s good year in 2008 as well as the subsequent decrease in production. For this reason she was able to evaluate the changes that were made at the company.  She has been working in the Home Design Section since 2009. If she had remained in the textile division, she would be currently unemployed. The tasks she performs for the Home Design Section are, however, only one part of her job description. At this point in time, she not only sews clothing, but she also meets with suppliers and is responsible for the storage of materials.</p>\r\n<p>According to her, the workload remains the same, just the nature of the work changes. She is still employed on a permanent basis. Her relationships with her co-workers are good and the same applies to her relationship with the company’s director. However, as an employee, she was involved in the decision-making about the company’s restructuring in only a passive manner. </p>\r\n<p>As far as evaluating the changes associated with the restructuring is concerned, she says that the changes were beneficial, as she did not lose her job. However she views the decline of the company’s textile division negatively and somewhat nostalgically. She says there were no drastic layoffs, and those that did occur were relatively calm and peaceful and no one left under dramatic circumstances, even though there were those who left dissatisfied. Those who remained must adjust to the frequent changes in their job descriptions and the associated increased level of stress. She says however that they have not yet exceeded the point of tolerance. </p>\r\n<p>As far as the personal impact the restructuring has had on Mr Havel, he says he has more work and less profit – it was CZK 8 million (€320,000) in 2010 and in 2012 it will be a ‘positive’ zero.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>In his recommendations for companies undergoing restructuring, Mr Havel mentioned the necessity of thoroughly considering each decision with full awareness of all of the factors that affect the process in question. Today’s business environment requires the ongoing analysis of every situation and continuous decision-making.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Vladan Hruška and Petr Bučina, RegioPartner, s.r.o.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Ivo Havel, Director, H&amp;D</p>\r\n<p>Lenka Kolářová, employee, H&amp;D</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Czech Republic"~"46 - wholesale trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles"~"50-249"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2012-03-08"
"Intercomplex, Bulgaria"~"Intercomplex Ltd"~"<p>Declining sales and profits were behind the decision to restructure in Bulgarian company Intercomplex, which provides equipment and services in the electrical sector. Major cuts were made to internal investments, and the production and trade divisions were restructured. Markets for the company’s products and services were expanded, and its products were adjusted according to the needs of new customers. Good organisation on the part of management and close involvement of the employees led to a smooth restructuring process. No staff were laid off and payments and benefits were preserved. The restructuring resulted in the planned outcomes, but at the expense of company profit.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Intercomplex Ltd. was established in 1990 as a private company. Since then, the company has been successfully developing its activities in the electrical sector. It now has a network of three regional offices, serving a wide range of customers and partners: energy distribution companies, investors, enterprises, wholesale and retail dealers.</p>\r\n<p>Intercomplex has been a limited company since 1996. The management structure includes three directions: production, trade and finance. The manager is a graduate from a vocational school for electricians. He is also a founder of the firm and one of the four co-owners. The other co-owners are not involved in the management of the company, but take part in the decision-making. The current manager–co-owner started his private business in 1980 as one of the first private firms in the city of Plovdiv, and this firm was later transformed into the current Intercomplex Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>The main aim of Intercomplex Ltd is to deliver continuously high quality products and services. The company offers the complete range of middle and low voltage electrical equipment and appliances, and complete engineering solutions in middle and low voltage electrical ‘turnkey’ projects in conformity with the applicable international and national standards, technical and other normative requirements.</p>\r\n<p>The bulk of the sales are to national customers and around 10% of the sales are exports, mainly to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. </p>\r\n<p>The main partners have been companies from the production, energy and communication sector, investors, small and medium-sized enterprises and trade companies.</p>\r\n<p>The company has a modern warehouse, which enables it to respond dynamically to the requirements of the customers and the market. This has considerably improved the organisation of the firm and the quality of services to its clients. The image of the firm as a reliable partner has also improved. </p>\r\n<p>The company has its own production and warehouse bases in Plovdiv, Sofia, Pazardzik and Septemvri, as well as the necessary transport infrastructure to deliver to all destinations required by the customers.</p>\r\n<p>Intercomplex Ltd has an established and functioning Integrated Management System according to the requirements of the following standards: EN ISO 9001:2000 /14.11.2006, OHSAS 18001:2007 /20.06.2008, EN ISO 14001:2004 /20.06.2008. The firm also has a certificate from the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for ‘best place to work’.</p>\r\n<p>On 20 May 2011, Intercomplex introduced a Management Declaration covering business development, human resources and social responsibility. Since then the management and the staff have worked according to the conditions of this declaration. The motivation behind this was the desire of both the management and employees to develop the organisational basis of their working order to improve the quality of their services and to deliver better quality services to their clients. </p>\r\n<p>The team consists of an ambitious and highly qualified personnel of 110, who provide adequate complete solutions and product information for delivery of electrical equipment, specialised servicing and competent consultation. The average age of the employees is 40 and around 70% of them are men: ten are electrical engineers and the rest are graduates from vocational schools for electricians or mechanics. </p>\r\n<p>A works council is present at the firm, which has an active relationship with management. This helped enormously with the whole process of the restructuring of the firm. According to the manager, better informed and motivated workers are an important condition for successful restructuring of the firm. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Between 2006 and 2008, the company enjoyed an annual increase of about 70% in profit and sales. This figure fell to about 30% in 2009–10. In 2011, profit and sales declined by around 10%. Restructuring was undertaken to counteract this decline in sales and profit, caused by the economic and financial crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The company embarked on an internal restructuring, geared towards reducing internal investments, in an effort to keep afloat during the crisis period. This applied to the production of new products, restructuring of production and trade, expanding of markets – mainly in Balkan countries, and negotiations with partners. Cuts were made to internal investments in every possible way, even for small expenses. Contacts with new trade partners (first and foremost in the Balkan countries) led to changes in the electric equipment produced by the company. Expanding of the markets was done on the basis of new planning of all current and perspective contacts. The employees in the trade department reconsidered their way and style of negotiations with foreign partners – customers and suppliers. All of that was carried out by the management of the firm as well the heads of all departments.</p>\r\n<p>The process started in 2008 and formally ended at the end of 2009, but in fact is still ongoing. The main reason for the restructuring event was the need to increase competitiveness in a period of economic and financial crisis. Investment had to be decreased because the likelihood of gaining access to capital was very low.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring event was planned in advance, because the prognosis in 2007–2008 was that the company had to restructure in order to survive. The decision was taken by the owners of the company. A number of options were considered, but they all agreed that restructuring of investments was the most important and urgent for the firm. The management had a very clear idea, but not a written restructuring plan. Naturally, a number of adjustments were made during the implementation of the restructuring process.</p>\r\n<p>The financial re-engineering of the company included a decrease of the volume of their credit lines by 20% without paying back open credits, but through using following instruments: negotiations of their credits with the bank for increasing the grace period of the credits and even switching to another bank, which agreed to refinance some of the credits of the firm. The company managed to do this because it had been a regular and trusted client of the banks in the City of Plovdiv for the last 20 years.</p>\r\n<p>The production component of the restructuring included: diversification of the electrical equipment produced, more intense negotiations with foreign partners, expansion of business relations with partners in neighbouring countries. All these activities were developed in a period of one to two years as a step-by-step process. </p>\r\n<p>The management informed and involved the employees during the different stages of the restructuring and considered that this was one of the main reasons for the success of the restructuring process. The  good organisation on the part of management and close involvement with the employees led to a smooth restructuring process. </p>\r\n<p>This opinion on the part of management was confirmed in an interview with an employee in the trade department, who expressed also the opinion that the employees had benefited from the way the restructuring was implemented and its results: no one was laid off and payments and benefits were preserved. Both management and employees agreed that the flexibility of small firms is the reason for better planning and implementation of restructuring in comparison with large firms.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Difficulties and problems experienced during planning and implementation of the restructuring process included:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lack of cash in-flow.</li>\r\n<li>Delays in deliveries of equipment from European firms,\r\nresulting in working conditions where the company could not fulfill its\r\nobligations to third parties.</li>\r\n<li>Delays in payments from customers. This is among the most\r\nserious constraints faced by Bulgarian businesses (SMEs in particular).\r\nAccording to the biggest Bulgarian business association (Bulgarian Industrial\r\nAssociation), inter-company indebtedness is actually the\r\nbiggest problem for the Bulgarian economy. Estimates are that it amounts to BGN\r\n100 billion (€50 billion). Many Bulgarian firms are simply not paying for\r\ngoods or services they order.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All of these factors affected the work of the company very badly because they prevented it from managing its financial operations properly.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The whole process of restructuring took place without any support from public bodies. The company needed financial support for some construction activities but it was not delivered by the banks. In reality some indirect support was delivered by their Polish partners, who, after long negotiations, rescheduled the payments from Intercomplex Ltd.for some of the supplies. Thus, they decreased the financial pressure on Intercomplex Ltd.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring took place according to the adjusted plans of the company. The restructuring resulted in the planned outcomes for the company, but it happened at the expense of company profit. In general, the employment effect was positive, although at certain periods some of the workers were on paid leave (this is a regime allowed by the labour legislation in Bulgaria and is commonly used during crisis periods). The management also put the emphasis on hiring young people. The management considers as a success the fact that they have kept their qualified personnel, a very difficult task nowadays in the Bulgarian economy. The business performance of the company was kept at an acceptable level, too.</p>\r\n<p>Future plans of Intercomplex Ltd. include investment of around €1 million for a second production base in the town of Septemvri, thus creating 50 new jobs. The development of these plans depends very much on the overall economic development of Bulgaria, the situation in this sector and the financial situation of the firm. The future plans also include better cooperation with their German partners.</p>\r\n<p>The economic situation of the company improved more quickly than expected. In general, the restructuring process was not easy.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Some of the lessons learnt were that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the banks should increase access to credits for firms\r\nduring crisis;</li>\r\n<li>less availability of investments leads to losses in firms\r\nin a period of crisis;</li>\r\n<li>economic and financial crisis showed the necessity of\r\nbeing realistic;</li>\r\n<li>it is better to stay relatively small – this allows\r\nfor easy restructuring, organisation and management of the firm.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Important success factors were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>restructuring of the financial funds has to be constantly\r\nunder consideration during the restructuring process;</li>\r\n<li>the process of negotiations with banks has positive\r\nlearning effects and hopefully will help the management with their relations\r\nwith banks and other investors in the near future.

"Lito Balkan,Bulgaria"~"Lito Balkan"~"<p>When confronted with the effects of the global economic crisis, increasing competition and decreasing demand for the current production, the management of the Bulgarian company Lito Balkan decided to expand and diversify by acquiring machinery to make new products. This resulted in access to new clients, a widening of their market and an increase in profits.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Lito Balkan was founded in October 1997 as a joint stock company of 100% private capital in the printing and publishing sector. The 60 shareholders of the company include some of its staff or natural persons, owners of companies acting as clients to the printing house, such as advertising agencies and publishers. The five members of the management team have all completed higher education in the printing and publishing fields and have each more than 20 years of specialised work experience. </p>\r\n<p>Boris Dimitrov has been executive director of the firm since 1999. He has a Masters degree from the Polygraphic Institute and has worked in the field of printing and publishing for 40 years. Over the past 30 years, he has worked as deputy director or director of different printing companies. He is the  founder and co-owner of Lito Balkan. Mr Dimitrov has experience in the restructuring of firms. His motto is ‘Do not run! You should have started on time!’</p>\r\n<p>The firm has 89 employees, most of them graduates of vocational schools of printing. Almost 50% are women, and the average age of the employees is 40. </p>\r\n<p>There is no works council or trade union branch in the company (similar to almost all SMEs in Bulgaria).</p>\r\n<p>Lito Balkan has an HR development programme which includes the continuous improvement of workers’ qualifications. This is a major reason for the limited staff turnover in the company.</p>\r\n<p>Since 2004, at the request of Disney America, an annual international social audit has been carried out to ensure compliance with health and safety requirements and the local labour legislation, which the company has successfully passed.</p>\r\n<p>The main competing tools of the company are high quality and short terms of the contract implementation. The company’s basic operational channels are: magazines and albums – 30% of the total volume; advertising – 30%; labels – 30%; books (paperback and hard cover) – 10%. </p>\r\n<p>The company was awarded an ISO 9001-2000 certificate by TUF Rheinland InterCert. </p>\r\n<p>The annual volume growth is between 10 and 25%. The profit in 2010 was low and in 2009 very low. Both sales and profits rose in 2011 in comparison with 2010. </p>\r\n<p>Lito Balkan’s main clients are: Carlsberg Bulgaria; Coca-Cola Bulgaria; Egmont Bulgaria (a Walt Disney division for children’s literature), as well as a number of publishers and magazines in Bulgaria.</p>\r\n<p>About 15% of the produce is intended for export to Russia, Greece, France, Italy and Switzerland. </p>\r\n<p>The technical equipment is as follows: a violet laser; sheet offset presses; binding machines; three folding machines, two straight binding cutters, and two label die-cutting machines. </p>\r\n<p>The company operates a full in-house production cycle. The availability of the equipment allows for the operation of a full technological cycle with sufficient flexibility. Lito Balkan printing house is the only one in Bulgaria with installed production line for multiple sheet spiral bound calendars. Additional customised binding machines are also available. </p>\r\n<p>The company has a successful investment programme. In 2000 it bought the Sts. Cyril and Methodius printing house from the Bulgarian Ministry of Finance in Sofia and over the past five years, using various forms of financing (leasing, internal credits, etc.), it managed to install and bring to full functionality equipment worth more than €3.5 million.</p>\r\n<p>The latest big investment of the company in the amount of €2.5 million is in the framework of its Investment Programme for Modernisation, which is the restructuring event described below. It was cofinanced by the Operative Programme ‘Development of Competitiveness of Bulgarian Economy 2007–2013’ and includes a new state of the art machine for labels and binding: the Gallus RC 430. This puts Lito Balkan in a leading position in this area in the whole of eastern Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The reason for the company restructuring was the need to find new clients, to enter the new markets of labels and folding, and to improve the quality of production. </p>\r\n<p>In fact, the start of the restructuring coincided with the beginning of the economic crisis. New developments included: the increasing competition in the branch, the decline in demand for the current production and an active motivation of owners and managers to expand and diversify.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring was planned in advance, on an annual basis, and the decision to restructure was taken by the board of directors of the company one year before the restructuring event. No other options for restructuring were considered because it was clear to the management that the introduction of a new printing machine was the only possibility for business expansion. The organisational stage of the preparation of the project was about six months.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring concept and the measures planned were developed by the company’s management on the basis of their long experience of dealing with the strengths and weaknesses of the company.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring event took the form of business expansion – more specifically, the acquisition of a new printing machine for labels folding/binding, which brought new clients, widening the market and increasing profit. The restructuring process started in June 2009 and ended December 2009. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring plan was implemented through drafting the project for cofinancing from the ‘Competitiveness’ Operational Programme. Unfortunately, the time schedule for the restructuring event was delayed by seven months, because of a delay in the selection procedure of the proposed projects. This delay created some problems for the firm and postponed the plans for development. After the approval of the project the process went smoothly – finalisation of negotiations and dealing with the sellers of the printing machine, installation of the machine, training of employees, testing of the production process. The financing of the restructuring was 80% own funds of the firm, and 20% from the Operational Programme.</p>\r\n<p>The whole process was supported by the workforce because they understood that the restructuring would save or even increase jobs. </p>\r\n<p>Interviews with employees confirmed the opinion of the management that one of the biggest success factors of restructuring was the lack of labour turnover. The organisational restructuring of the firm, after the acquisition of a new machine, led to a reduction in the number of workers in some departments. These workers were transferred to work with the new label and folding machine. The transfer concerned about 10 workers, who accepted the change of work station and did it voluntarily; thus no redundancy was observed. Obviously they took into account the worsening economic situation at that moment. The management organised good information sessions on the forthcoming changes. The reaction of the employees was very positive – they understand very well the need for transformation of the business. Obviously they preferred transformation to losing their jobs. The prevailing opinion is that small firms have advantages in planning and implementing restructuring in comparison with larger companies. The advantages of SMEs include flexible HR, better adaptability, easier management, less formal organisational process, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>During the planning and implementation of the restructuring event, no serious difficulties or problems were observed, except the already mentioned delay by seven months for approval of the project. Otherwise, the process of applying and approval of the project went smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Financial support for buying the new machine came through the ‘Competitiveness’ Operational Programme, which is focused on provision of support to Bulgarian business, in particular SMEs. Apart from the co-financing support by the Operational Programme, the company did not receive any advice or support from the state authorities, banks or media. The management of Lito Balkan tried to explore all these possibilities, but failed. In the past few years the importance of the Operational Programmes for Bulgarian business has increased because of the lack of funding from other financial sources. The combination of EU funds and national budget cofinancing proved to be successful. The fact that firms could not count on banks’ financing, unlike in previous years, pushed enterprises to be more active in applying for projects for funding from the Operational Programmes. </p>\r\n<p>Technical support through experts and training (financed by the project) was provided when the new machinery was put into operation. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>In general, the restructuring, although somewhat delayed, took place according to plan. The employment effect was the preservation of the number of employees during the period of economic crisis. The firm prepared for a long time for this investment and mobilised all of its financial resources to purchase the new machine. The pay and benefits of the employees were preserved and during the last two years even increased. </p>\r\n<p>The purchase of a new machine was for the purpose of closing the production cycle, which has led to a complete organisational change in the firm. </p>\r\n<p>Various organisational adjustments were made: a new structure was approved and enforced, new departments developed their activities, the organisational chain in every department was streamlined, and the functions of all employees were described in more detailed manner. The restructuring is having a positive effect on the business performance of the company in terms of an increase in profit, retaining staff, closing the production cycle, diversification of products, and an improvement in the quality of printing materials.</p>\r\n<p>The overall outcome of the restructuring was considered positive by both the management and the employees. For the time being, management has no future plans regarding the business strategy of the firm.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The following lessons were learned:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>During a period of crisis SMEs have to diversify their\r\nactivities.</li>\r\n<li>It is very important to invest in new products in a\r\ntimely manner.</li>\r\n<li>SMEs have advantages over larger companies in planning\r\nand implementing restructuring because they are more flexible in production and\r\nmanagement.</li>\r\n<li>During an economic crisis, state institutions have to\r\ndevelop a new policy and instruments for support of SMEs, such as easier credit\r\nfor SMEs, improvement of the business environment, decrease of administrative\r\nburden.</li>\r\n<li>The ‘grey’ sector is a real threat to the\r\ndevelopment of SMEs, which are following the rules of the game especially during\r\na time of crisis.</li>\r\n<li>Success is possible with a high level of work input and\r\npersonal engagement, both by the management and the staff.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The main success factors identified were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A clear concept for restructuring is not enough for\r\nsuccess: a huge amount of organisational work and self-help activities have to\r\nbe done in order to achieve success.</li>\r\n<li>During the period of restructuring, the company has to\r\nprepare and adapt the internal structure for further growth.</li>\r\n<li>All players – owners, management, employees –\r\nhave to recognise that they all have to bear the negative consequences of the\r\ncrisis and its influence on the company.</li>\r\n<li>It is very important for the management to do its best to\r\nlet the workers know that employers, by taking different measures, are trying to\r\nmaintain the highest possible number of jobs in the firm.</li>\r\n<li>Lack of information concerning the upcoming changes in\r\nthe firm often leads to rumours or fears or even a mistrustful atmosphere in the\r\ncompany, which always slows down the restructuring process (fortunately, this\r\ncompany did not experience such a situation).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Elena Krastenova and Vladimir Pavlov, Foundation for Entrepreneurship Development</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Boris Dimitrov, Executive Director, Lito Balkan, and two of the employees</p>\r\n<p><b>Website of the company</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://lito-balkan.com"">http://lito-balkan.com</a> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Bulgaria"~"18 - printing and reproduction of recorded media"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"business expansion"~"2012-03-14"
"MERET, Slovakia"~"MERET, s.r.o."~"<p>In order to remain up-to-date with technology changes, Slovak high-tech company Meret decided to introduce new technology for in-house production as well as to strengthen cooperation with a research institute. The new technology introduced in 2008 had a positive effect on company production and productivity, helping it to overcome the effects of the crisis and substantially enhancing the company&rsquo;s production. </p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>MERET s.r.o. was established in 1990 and has gradually become the biggest Slovak producer of measurement and regulation technologies in the field of pressure measurement. It can be considered a high-tech company.</p>\r\n<p>MERET is located in the southwest of Slovakia, in the capital city, Bratislava. Although it is an independent limited liability company, it has a working and contractual relationship with a wide spectrum of cooperating companies within Slovakia and the Czech Republic. This enables MERET to specialise in the finalisation of products.</p>\r\n<p>The company has two co-owners, one of whom has already retired. The other is Du&scaron;an Hupka, who is the major shareholder and managing director (MD). Mr Hupka started his entrepreneurial activities in 1985, providing computer servicing when 8-bit computers became available on the market and the era of personal computers commenced.</p>\r\n<p>In 1990, MERET started with six employees. This number rose with the increasing demand for their products and growing market share. At its peak in 2000, the company employed 24 staff. MERET requires very flexible production arrangements. Fluctuations in the number of employees are related to specific orders and natural turnover of employees, not exceeding two per year. In the first quarter of 2012, the workforce stood at 14. The general employment policy of the company is focused on highly qualified staff that are capable of the mutual substitution necessary in this type of business. The company has benefited from the intellectual potential of its employees by implementing hundreds of technical solutions that have been considered highly inventive, at optimal cost level, and quick to implement. This has been a competitive advantage of the company.</p>\r\n<p>MERET is a developer and producer of manometers, thermometers, calorimeters, various types of transmitters, data loggers, and displaying and control units. MERET products are found in nuclear, hydroelectric and thermal power stations, in dams at Czech and Slovak rivers, in drinking water basins, mines, dairies, agribusinesses, mobile or stationary devices of the Slovak Army, in storehouses of petroleum products, at petrol filling stations, and in major large companies such &lsquo;Slovensk&yacute; Plyn&aacute;rensk&yacute; Priemysel&rsquo; (Slovak Gas Industry) Slovnaft, and US Steel production plants. The company&rsquo;s products are also exported primarily to the countries of the European Union (EU), China and the USA.</p>\r\n<p>MERET&rsquo;s products have become more reliable with improved construction, quality and design. Passive visual display units have changed into modern devices equipped with processors, allowing for user-friendly operation and higher quality of communication with attending personnel, and have transformed into devices of the new generation. Despite the wide portfolio of products, the company&rsquo;s production has been focused on outsourcing of mid-tech parts to cooperating firms and concentrating on finalising its high-tech products. This allows for steady production growth. Despite the recent crisis, the company attained its maximal turnover in 2011.</p>\r\n<p>The company does not have any relationships with trade unions, nor an existing works council.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>MERET produces customer-designed measuring systems, which means that innovation is a permanent component of the firm&rsquo;s daily activities. The company has undergone two major changes in recent years: 1) introduced new technology for the production of small series components in-house; and 2) cooperated with a research institute to innovate their products.</p>\r\n<p>In the spring of 2008, the MD started innovating the company&rsquo;s production by introducing new technology for soldering electronic elements to printed circuit boards. Previously the production was conducted manually and on order only. MERET&rsquo;s product portfolio is quite wide and production series of individual products are in the range of 150&ndash;200 pieces. Producing small series means that outsourcing production is not very viable for MERET as many companies are not willing to cooperate. The companies that did cooperate would usually take a long time to process the orders, or be very inflexible. This complicated the entire production process and MERET was more or less forced into finding an alternative. The MD admits that it would be easier for MERET if they could outsource this production to another company that already has the technological capabilities for this specialised production. The purchase of the new automatic machine, and its maintenance, was an extra cost for MERET, but it enabled them to produce their products in small series in-house.</p>\r\n<p>MERET aims to constantly innovate its products in order to retain its market position and competitiveness on the world market. Since 2010, the company has cooperated with the research institute of the Technical University in Brno (the Czech Republic). The research project was designed to install standardised communication protocols into the MERET produced devices. This enables the integration of the company products into large control systems anywhere in the world. The HART protocol is one of the basic communication protocols for these purposes. It is used especially in the area of measurement technology and enables digital communication with individual measuring components while maintaining the requirements for easy installation. It enables their integration into large measuring systems. Only close cooperation with electronic hardware specialists, respecting the changes in company products, and software specialists on one-chip processors, with sufficient knowledge of communication with HART protocol and its application into measurement technology, could create an efficient solution to this problem.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The implementation of the new technology, the automatic machine, took four months to complete and was funded from the company&rsquo;s surplus profits. There was no formal plan for restructuring, given the size of the company. Purchasing the new machine was solely the MD&rsquo;s decision: he did not seek any advice. He reviewed a range of machines before making the purchase. This decision has led to an increased productivity in the production chain, but did not have a major impact on the company&rsquo;s performance. The MD notes that their production is driven by demand. Hence they produce only in quantities that the company is able to sell. To operate the new automatic machine requires qualified supervision and programming expertise of the operating staff for accommodating the change to another product. Five employees received training which lasted for about a month to be able to operate the machine. They reacted positively to the changes in the company. To operate the machine requires only two employees at the time and they can simultaneously perform other activities. As a result, a number of posts in the company became redundant. According to the MD, two employees had retired during that period and were not replaced. Additionally, two employees decided to end their contract with the company. A number of contract staff were made redundant.</p>\r\n<p>The company makes a regular contribution to the employment fund (<em>N&aacute;rodn&yacute; &uacute;rad pr&aacute;ce</em> previously known as <em>Fond zamestnanosti SR</em>), which provides unemployment benefits and skills training for the unemployed. Because the fund is compulsory for all employers in the country, the MD felt no need to provide further assistance to the employees affected by redundancy, apart from the two months&rsquo; redundancy pay. The MD is dissatisfied with the employment fund, given their contributions. In the past, MERET approached <em>N&aacute;rodn&yacute; &uacute;rad pr&aacute;ce</em> to help them find new staff, but they could never find suitable candidates through the fund.</p>\r\n<p>The integration of standardised communication protocols into products was driven by an attempt to increase the competitiveness of MERET in world markets. This would increase productivity and value added. Using standardised communication of the individual products enabled their integration into large measuring systems and automation of extensive and complex processes. Unified communication is the most important precondition for smooth integration of the individual gauges and measuring circuits, even if they are made by different producers or some of their original components have already been replaced by MERET devices. This development in cooperation with the research institution was supported by the innovation grant. The grant was provided partially from the European Regional Development Fund based on application for international cooperation with the research institution abroad. The project was successfully completed in the middle of 2011.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>MERET is a small producer of special measuring devices for industry use. More than 60% of its production is exported, mainly to EU countries, China and the USA. The products can be found in the satellite-controlled system of unmanned petrol filling stations throughout the outback in Australia. It produces customer-designed measuring systems that require permanent research and development by its own staff and also in cooperation with other companies or research institutions. To manage and finance such innovation activities is very demanding.</p>\r\n<p>Support for SMEs in Slovakia and the amount of financial resources for these purposes is insufficient compared to the state aid provided to large multinational investors. However, substantial improvements of the business environment would help SMEs more than any other forms of support. The business environment in Slovakia still has problems in certain areas, such as problematic enforcement of legal rights, high administrative burden for businesses, public sector inefficiency, a poor range of e-government services, high social and health insurance costs and an administratively demanding mechanism for reposting and paying those sums, and continuing practices of corruption in all state institutions. The process of addressing these shortcomings is progressing very slowly or not at all. This is a huge barrier for all activities in SMEs including restructuring either during company development or in crisis.</p>\r\n<p>A common feature of those problem areas in the business environment is their complexity and dependence on multiple functions of government. For this reason, any further improvement in these areas requires a systematic approach, interdepartmental coordination and active cooperation of the entrepreneurs and their professional organisations. The government is not able to make any substantial improvements.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>In the 1990s, when the company started, there were no opportunities to get advice or counselling. These services developed at the end of 1990s, with some state support and support from the EU through the pre-accession funds. More recently, there has been visible development of private counselling services in the area of company operations. However, MERET did not seek any advice or support services at the time. The company has been able to manage with its own knowledge and resources.</p>\r\n<p>The mentioned grant is the only instance where the company received support. However, according to the MD, the bureaucracy and regulation associated with funding opportunities from the EU can be discouraging. In practice, any small company seeking funds from the EU is unable to proceed without employing administrative help. The MD is very sceptical about business advice and support for small and medium-sized enterprises in Slovakia, perceiving it as non-existent and more of rhetoric.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The new technology introduced in 2008 had a positive effect on the company production and productivity. MERET have been able to produce more for less as a result, also due to decreased cost of employment. The new technology helped MERET overcome the effects of the crisis and substantially enhanced the company&rsquo;s production; however, it has only been one of the contributing factors in their increase in sales.</p>\r\n<p>The introduction of the new technology has affected employment in the company; two employees decided to end their contracts and left and two employees who retired have not been replaced. Moreover, the contracts with employees who worked on contract were cancelled and the staff were given two months&rsquo; redundancy pay. Some were able to find a new job and some of those who were made redundant started their own business and still cooperate with MERET, providing services that are marginal to MERET&rsquo;s core activities. During these changes to employment the MD tried not to agonise too much over the whole process; there simply was no alternative and it had to be done. Despite this, he found it personally distressing to have to implement redundancies.</p>\r\n<p>Restructuring related to the innovation and introduction of the HART protocol into the systems for control of measuring devices improved the competitiveness of the company&rsquo;s production in the world markets. It has had some impact on production organisation and management but, unlike the introduction of the new automatic machine for production, the introduction of HART protocol into MERET&rsquo;s products had no effect on the employment numbers. The current employment structure of the company allows greater flexibility, which can facilitate future restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>The interviewed employee supervises and programmes the automatic soldering machine. He finds this work challenging but also rewarding because he must participate in the development activities related to specific orders. He considers interpersonal relations in the company to be good. Everybody is involved in and responsible for quality production and timely fulfilment of orders for customers. He knows that his salary is closely related to company performance. The interviewee took part in both mentioned elements of the restructuring, which he considers a good experience that has provided interesting work opportunities. Even though some employees had to leave the company, others continue working as subcontractors or employees in partner companies.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>MERET is a successful high-tech company constantly involved in innovation activities. This is a precondition to success in this very competitive sector. The steady development and improvement of products and technologies of MERET depends on frequent restructuring events. The management of the company realises that only skilled and dedicated staff can guarantee the success of MERET in the market. The difficult decisions related to restructuring are made in an attempt to benefit both the company and its employees; however, as a small company MERET can look after and support its employees only to the extent that this does not threaten the existence of the company.</p>\r\n<p>The case study of MERET provides an example of a small company that has had to cut staff numbers as a result of necessary changes to their production. The difficulties in finding a suitable contractor company to outsource their production forced MERET to innovate and produce in-house. The company purchased a new automatic machine in an attempt to make their production processes more efficient, which subsequently made several work positions redundant.</p>\r\n<p>The high level of employment-related contributions is a great cost for small firms in Slovakia. At the same time, in order to help decrease the rates of unemployment in the country, businesses require greater motivation from the state to employ young people. According to the MD, it is currently more beneficial for employers to employ people of pension age rather than young graduates since contributions for the latter group are higher and the cost of time that an employer puts into training a young employee outstrips any benefits.</p>\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Juraj Poledna, Peritus</p>\r\n<p>Eva Kasperova, Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews </strong></p>\r\n<p>Du&scaron;an Hupka, Co-owner and Managing Director, MERET s.r.o.</p>\r\n<p>Technical employee</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company website</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.meret.sk/"">http://www.meret.sk/</a></p>"~"Slovakia"~"27 - manufacture of electrical equipment"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2011-12-20"
"Michael Debono, Malta"~"Michael Debono Limited"~"<p>A family-owned car sales and repair company in Malta decided that for it to be able to grow and survive, it had to modernise work practices and company structures. Over three years and with the help of representatives of the car manufacturer whose products were sold, the company introduced price transparency, increased services and sales for used cars, computerised business management processes. This helped the company to grow, doubling also the number of employees.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Michael Debono Ltd. is a typical family-owned but professionally run business. It operates mainly in the motor car sector, retailing new and used Toyota vehicles, Toyota industrial equipment and commercial vehicles under the Hino brand, a Toyota subsidiary. It is now retailing multi-brand used cars. Its fully integrated operation includes service maintenance, body repairs and spare parts retail operations on one site.</p>\r\n<p>In August 1960, the late Michael Debono imported the first Toyota car into Malta &ndash; the Toyopet Crowne Deluxe. This was the very first Toyota car sold in Europe and it heralded the beginning of a dynamic future in a business which would be passed down to subsequent generations.</p>\r\n<p>In 1960, a company was formed with two other partners under the name Michael Debono &amp; Co., which was subsequently appointed by Toyota as the official sole importer and distributor for Malta. It was not, however, until the early 1970s that Michael Debono became sole owner of the business and from there on operated as a sole trader.</p>\r\n<p>In 1988, Michael Debono Ltd. was formed, with Michael and his only son Philip as the shareholders. Michael Debono passed away in 1999 and the running of the business was taken over by Philip.</p>\r\n<p>Philip Debono passed away in 2002, and his spouse Therese continued to run the business on her own, while her two young sons Geoffrey and Michael continued to pursue their studies.</p>\r\n<p>In 2003, a senior representative of Toyota visited Malta and a decision was taken to provide the Debono family with the necessary assistance to continue running the company, and enhance the brand perception in Malta. Plans were subsequently put into place to put the responsibility for Malta under Toyota Great Britain given that they had the necessary resources to support the family in the management of the company.</p>\r\n<p>In March 2005, Toyota GB signed a formal agreement with Michael Debono Ltd. to transfer one of their senior managers to Malta for three years, during which time he would work with the family to establish Toyota proven procedures and work practices, and help spearhead the business towards future growth.</p>\r\n<p>When he graduated as a bachelor of commerce in June 2005, Geoffrey Debono took over as Managing Director of the company at the age of 21. His educational background is complemented by personal enthusiasm for the business, which he developed in his early teens, having spent most summer holidays working within it.</p>\r\n<p>In 2008, Geoffrey was awarded Malta&rsquo;s Outstanding Young Person of the Year for Entrepreneurial Accomplishment, following his restructuring of Michael Debono Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>In 2010, the company reconfirmed representation of Toyota Industrial Equipment and in the following year it established representation of Hino commercial vehicles.</p>\r\n<p>The shareholding of the company is held by the Debono family. The board of directors comprises three family members &ndash; Geoffrey, his mother Therese and younger sibling Michael &ndash; and one non-family member. As managing director, Geoffrey reports directly to the board. The board has also appointed a management team which handles the running of the company, which operates from its main premises in Żebbuġ. There are five managers who report directly to the managing director.</p>\r\n<p>Michael Debono Ltd. operates within the local market and has a workforce of 80 full-time employees: 61 male and 19 female. Its core workforce consists of a number of highly trained, skilled technicians for both servicing and maintenance/repair operations.</p>\r\n<p>Management is currently in the process of finalising a human resources strategy setting out the type of behaviour and attitude that is expected from employees, and which conforms to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, dealing with policies on anti-corruption, anti-discrimination, labour law and the environment. The company also operates a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy, which is effected through the company&rsquo;s board.</p>\r\n<p>The human resource policies of the company are based on democratic, caring concepts and there is a strong owner&ndash;manager/employee ethic which results in good industrial relations.</p>\r\n<p>The company has generated growth in revenue and an increase in profit for most of its departments.

As sales were static, it was felt that new blood was required to change the direction of the company. It was also firmly believed that the brand had considerable potential.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The decision which led to the internal restructuring of the company was part of a long-term strategy which would see the company develop into a more modern and customer-focused business.</p>\r\n<p>The management team decided that further investment was needed for the company to enhance its operations and develop into a more entrepreneurial business. This required looking beyond the standard practices adopted by the company and its competitors at the time. The strategy needed to be forward-looking with a focus on customer and employee satisfaction. The management believes that it is only by investing in the customer, and its personnel that customer and employee loyalty is achieved.</p>\r\n<p>As the representative of the Toyota brand in Malta, the company also receives Toyota support, particularly through the provision of people with experience to help in the modernisation process.</p>\r\n<p>In 2004, with its targets firmly set, the management team devised a business plan which would set out the projections, budget plan, timeframes and deliverables for the restructuring project.</p>\r\n<p>Plans were immediately put in place to construct a new Toyota &lsquo;Retail Concept&rsquo; showroom complex, together with underground parking and a larger area for sale of parts. The new showroom was completed in two years.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, a fully computerised business management system was installed, together with a review of management and staffing levels and &lsquo;Toyota Way&rsquo; work practices.</p>\r\n<p>Management also planned for new profitable revenue streams. It identified the used car market as a key area for growth. All used cars are imported and meet strict requirements with regard to age, condition and mileage. Also, having experienced a drop in its marginal return on new cars, the company invested in the development of a new and larger workshop for its service department and also in a larger parts area. By diversifying its portfolio, the company worked to secure multiple revenue streams; and hence, more secure/stable profitability and better working conditions.</p>\r\n<p>Price transparency is considered to be a critical selling tool. On the basis of this principle, the company also implemented a transparent pricing system for new cars. A price list of all its new and used cars was introduced on the company&rsquo;s website. People visiting the showroom will also find an information stand, together with a price list of all models on display.</p>\r\n<p>The company also embarked on setting up new departments so as to offer customers a wider range of products and services on the basis of a one-stop shop. For example, in recent years Michael Debono Ltd. has begun to act as a broker for a leading insurance company. This provided customers with the opportunity to purchase an insurance policy when buying a new or used car, thereby meeting customers&rsquo; needs from a single point of service.</p>\r\n<p>The management team decided to departmentalise operations to ensure that each department was managed as a separate business unit, each monitoring its own respective profitability. This decision was viewed positively by both management and employees.</p>\r\n<p>The whole restructuring process took over three years to complete: from June 2005 to December 2008 &ndash; and was self-funded.</p>\r\n<p>Employees were informed in advance of the restructuring project. A management consultant was commissioned by the company during the initial planning stage to interview each and every employee on a one-to-one basis. The consultant explained the restructuring process to the employees and reported on their views, ambitions and objectives within the company. This process also served to identify key players around whom the new structure would be built.</p>\r\n<p>A number of employees were initially hesitant about the restructuring of the company, job security being their main concern. However, once employees were informed of what and how these changes were to be effected, the general reaction of the workforce was both positive and supportive. Improved facilities and conditions of work fostered the right attitude and approach to achieve the corporate objectives.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>One of the main challenges encountered during the restructuring process was in helping employees understand the benefits that would arise from the modernisation of the company, which would consequently result in a better and more efficient working environment for all.</p>\r\n<p>Initially, employees were reluctant to endorse the planned changes for the business: in particular, the decision to involve a foreign service manager in the management of the company. Employees were anxious about how &lsquo;a foreigner&rsquo; would assess their performance and even affect the usual way of conducting day-to-day business, representing a possible threat to their job security.</p>\r\n<p>However, this anxiety was soon dispelled once employees understood how the restructuring was to take place. They even managed to develop a good working relationship with the new member of the management team.</p>\r\n<p>The management asserts that good communication was the tool that smoothed out the initial challenges encountered within the workforce.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Fundamental to the success of the restructuring of the company was the professionalism adopted in the study, planning, and implementation of the project. The support received by Michael Debono Ltd. was mainly in the form of guidance and operational support provided by Toyota. In particular, the decision taken by Toyota GB to transfer one of their senior managers to Malta in order to assist in the modernisation of the company proved to be of considerable benefit.</p>\r\n<p>Michael Debono Ltd. believes that the most valuable type of assistance which could be received in a restructuring exercise is that of guidance on how to sustain a business in a highly competitive market; together with assistance in restructuring, planning and implementation through knowledge transfer and the exchange of best practices between professionals in the field.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The modernisation project executed by Michael Debono Ltd. not only led to a restructuring of its internal organisational set-up, but also resulted in business expansion and profitable returns for the company.</p>\r\n<p>The development linked to the core Toyota business, which was carried out in the shape of a fully-fledged, on-site centre combining body repair and a paint shop, augmented turnover considerably. As the development link to the Toyota business started to take place, new personnel were recruited with the company. For example, in the body repair and paint shop, 18 new people were employed over a short span of years in order to be able to meet the growing demand from customers for such services. An experienced body shop administrator was also recruited to manage such developments.</p>\r\n<p>The company has also experienced a return on its investment in the used car market and the development of its parts and services departments. Revenues went up and increase in profit was reported for most departments; a factor which Michael Debono Ltd. attributes to the investment and hard work injected into the restructuring of the company.</p>\r\n<p>Following the restructuring measures undertaken, Michael Debono Ltd. has more than doubled the number of its full-time employees. In fact, the number of workers employed on a full-time contract increased from 34 to 80 after the restructuring process. Young, energetic people were brought into the business, and together with other members of staff were provided with various training programmes which would ensure that all employees acquired the skills and knowledge commensurate with their responsibilities and the targeted customer satisfactory.</p>\r\n<p>The review of management and staffing performance within the company led to the dismissal of a few employees who were considered to be ill-fitted to their job. Organisational adjustments were also introduced at managerial level. Some employees were promoted as a result of growth in other areas of the business. Three new managers were brought in and one manager&rsquo;s job was terminated because of his resistance to change. An experienced outside director was also brought on to the board to help in business diversification.</p>\r\n<p>After all the planning which went into the implementation of the project, the management team is satisfied with the overall outcome of the project, which brought about positive results in employer-employee relations and in customer relations. A formal human resources policy is also being developed for the company and remuneration improvement has been introduced as a result of a comprehensive review of tasks and the introduction of a more formal salary and wages structure. The company also offers a remuneration adjustment for employees who choose to invest further in their development. The company ultimately believes that customer and employee satisfaction are inextricably intertwined.</p>\r\n<p>Michael Debono Ltd. has a number of projects in the pipeline, which would feed into the future expansion of the company and the development of new opportunities. The company is also studying the possibility of tapping into foreign markets; in particular, the company has plans to set up a base in Libya.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The process of restructuring in large companies is considered to be more immune to the interpersonal relationships that develop between individuals working within SMEs, although other influences (such as the presence of trade unions) may make it a more challenging process for larger companies.</p>\r\n<p>The management believes that at the root of a restructuring process is how the activity is perceived by employees and the way in which the company communicates with employees about restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>If communication is right, employees will feel part of the process and the likelihood is that most employees would be willing to collaborate and contribute towards the overall process of restructuring. Communication also breeds security and a sense of belonging, effectively diminishing the chances of employees&rsquo; resistance to change.</p>\r\n<p>Geoffrey Debono looks positively on the overall outcome of the restructuring process and attributes its success to the development and careful implementation of its sound Business Plan and to the assistance provided by Toyota GB. Geoffrey also commends the dedication and personal effort demonstrated by the management team and members of staff to make the final outcome a positive experience for everyone.</p>\r\n<p>All the above factors ultimately add up to a good formula for success.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Claudine Borg, Europa Research and Consultancy Services Ltd.

"Ödeshögs Mekaniska, Sweden"~"Ödeshögs Mekaniska"~"<p>This Swedish metal engineering company suffered badly when orders dropped by a third due to the crisis. The inflexibility of the Swedish law meant they had to lay off those with the most important skills for the company survival. The experience has made the company more cautious when hiring new staff. Additionally, it outsources more to be more flexible in the next crisis.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The company &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska was founded in 1986 and initially was a one-man company located in a garage. The founder had the vision to start up an engineering workshop where clients could order what they needed. He bought part of a field and built his enterprise &ndash; &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska. Soon there were three employees and later on the company grew.</p>\r\n<p>The business is metalwork, from the raw piece of metal to the finished component, all produced according to the customer&rsquo;s requirements. The employees all are specialists within their fields such as metal cutting, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) and welding. The business idea is to be a subcontractor of components, not to produce products for final use.</p>\r\n<p>In 2002 the firm invested in new premises, buying properties from the municipality of &Ouml;desh&ouml;g, which had formerly been used by SAAB. At this time it had 20 employees. The company continued to grow and in 2007 after making further investments in buildings it grew fast, from 50 employees to 75. When the company was experiencing its highest production levels there were 75 to 79 employees and, in addition to this, it hired temporary personnel from staffing agencies and used services from one-man subcontractor companies.</p>\r\n<p>&Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska works as a subcontractor for many clients but has no branches or outlets besides its plant in &Ouml;desh&ouml;g. The founder and sole owner of the company is still the CEO and today it has about 55 blue-collar workers and ten white-collar workers. Just around 14% are women and the average age is 44 years old. The business does not export or work actively with international clients; however it is a subcontractor to many clients with international businesses. Before the financial crisis, in 2008, the business was directed more towards local customers than it is today. Now it is subcontracting for several clients at national level in order to diversify risk and not be dependent on a few, large, local customers.</p>\r\n<p>Karin Claesson came to the company in 2007 after working as a teacher in a high school. She became human resources manager, a position that formerly had not existed. Before her appointment, the production manager had been responsible for issues concerning the personnel. Ms Claesson has a university diploma in pedagogics, and when she started her new job in 2007, she immediately became involved in improving the work atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p>The company has a Human Resources Social Responsibility strategy that was developed before the restructuring in 2008 though it has now been developed further. Ms Claesson, who was hired when the company grew rapidly in 2007 started to create a plan to involve employees more in the company and to become aware of their vision. She has developed a system where she has a yearly planning and development conversation with every employee. This is done in order to get input from everyone and to anchor development within the company among the employees. Conversations have had different themes and groups have been formed within the company to involve employees more.</p>\r\n<p>The company has an agreement with the trade union IF Metall. However, IF Metall does not have a local trade union branch at the company. Therefore during negotiations concerning dismissals it has, in keeping with the law on co-determination, to invite a representative from IF Metall&rsquo;s central organisation. Only one IF Metall representative is present during negotiations.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In June 2008, Karin Claesson wondered if the company was going to be affected by the recession, as other companies had been during the year. At the beginning of November, she thought the company had avoided the worst part and would not have to give any notices to employees. Then overnight the phones stopped ringing. The firm realised that it was not getting any orders and that the financial crisis had finally reached &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska.</p>\r\n<p>Back in 2008 the company was dependent on two large customers. When these customers dipped during the financial crisis, they took &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska with them.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring started in December 2008. Company assets had fallen by 30% and there were no other options than to give notice to employees even though the firm didn&rsquo;t want to do this. It waited a bit too long to make the decision since it was optimistic, hoping to find an alternative to announcing redundancies. It gathered all of the employees together to announce the restructuring necessary in order for the company to be able to survive. The process was fast when the board finally, after negotiations with a trade union representative from IF Metall, took the decision to give notice to 18 people. In December 12 employees had to leave, with an additional six leaving in April. In addition, one employee retired during this period; no-one else left voluntarily. Before the crisis, there had been a high turnover in employees, with many new workers recruited in 2007. This meant many staff had only a shord record of working for the company. Since they had the fewest years in the company, they were the ones asked to leave as an effect of the Swedish law concerning employment security (<em>Lagen om anst&auml;llningsskydd</em>). The notices were based on the law of &lsquo;last in, first out&rsquo;. The negotiator on behalf of IF Metall was very firm on this matter and this speeded up the restructuring process.</p>\r\n<p>During the negotiations Karin Claesson and the board tried to negotiate around the rules, explaining they had objective reasons for giving notices to employees in certain units and to retain the welders, since they were needed for the production. The negotiations led nowhere since the negotiator on behalf of IF Metall was very difficult to convince and showed no understanding. He was convinced the reason for keeping the welders was a personal one and not business. According to Karin Claesson this was not true, but finally the company had to accept this and give the welders notices.</p>\r\n<p>Since she had worked to improve personal contact with the workers, this made the contact during the restructuring process easier since they were able to discuss difficult matters.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned, &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska waited a bit too long before it finally took the decision to give notices and commence the restructuring The workers had to make sacrifices during this period. Some had to work extra while others had to sit around waiting for orders to come. Nevertheless, everyone had been aware of the situation due to the conversations they had had with Ms Claesson and the board, and due to the meetings that had been held.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>In 2007, Karin Claesson had been searching for specialists in welding since this competence was hard to find within the region and there was much competition between companies to attract these workers. She had just hired welders when the crisis struck &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska and many of their production sectors were left without work, although the welding unit still received orders. Since she had recently hired the welders, this became a problem during the restructuring since, according to the Swedish law concerning employment security, the workers who enter the company last are the ones to leave first. So, when the firm realised it had to announce redundancies it had to follow this law and give notices to the recently hired welders, even though the company was still getting orders.</p>\r\n<p>Since the company had fewer welders than welding orders, those welders still employed had to work even more and this was challenging. Also, cleaning personnel had to leave due to the rule, causing a negative work environment. Meanwhile, other units in the company still had workers but no orders. The firm tried to deal with this challenge by cutting the night shift but were not able to move workers from one unit to another since particular skills were needed in each unit and specialists couldn&rsquo;t just be replaced by other workers. Neither was the firm allowed to hire the skills it required during the restructuring period. Everyone had to work harder, since 25% of the workforce left in this period. The remaining welders had to work double shifts which was hard, but this probably saved many jobs in the end.</p>\r\n<p>The experience of December 2008 meant the process was easier in April 2009 when the second round of notices was given. This contributed to better negotiations. In April the company had a younger and more understanding IF Metall negotiator who had more experience of working with businesses and was easier to negotiate with. This made a great difference to the company&rsquo;s chances of survival.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>During the restructuring process, the company used support from the Safety Fund (<em>Trygghetsfonden</em>). With this support it was able to give former employees coaching and help in finding new jobs. The employees that were given notice also got support in trying to find new jobs from the coaching company, Startkraft, a private company financed by&nbsp;Trygghetsr&aring;det and thereby drawing on 35 years&rsquo; experience of restructuring work in Swedish industry.</p>\r\n<p>Another source of support was tapped when one of &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska's clients was visiting subcontractors asking if anyone was interested in joining a European Social Fund (ESF) project where they could invest in strengthening their skills. This led to the company applying for and receiving SEK 860,000 (&euro; 97,233) from the ESF to invest in employee training. Since business was slow at this stage, this was the perfect opportunity for the company to send its workers to improve their knowledge in their respective fields. Previously, the education budget had been very limited. The company gave this opportunity to prominent employees, allowing them to develop their skills within welding or other specialised metalwork and hopefully stay longer. The project was called IUC &Ouml;st and the result has been an entirely new way of thinking. This has been a great improvement for the company and the workers have appreciated the investment in their competence. Education has become more important within the company which formerly was more production-oriented.</p>\r\n<p>Karin Claesson calls for more public support regarding counselling and guidance in restructuring. For instance, it would be helpful knowing which consultants to use and what coaching agencies to recommend to workers. After the crisis and the resultant redundancies, the company used coaching companies and found this really helpful for former employees. However, during the past few years, a lot of bogus coaching companies have emerged and Ms Claesson is calling for more control of these companies in order to ensure companies such as &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska get the right support during restructuring. The company Startkraft were recommended to them by the trade union IF Metall but further advice on this is requested in order to make the right choices in investments during difficult times.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008 the company hit bottom; now it is recovering step by step. It still experiences effects caused by the crisis and its business still has not recovered completely. One effect on the company is that it has become more aware of the financial situation on the markets and more observant of cyclical fluctuations within the economy. Today the workers and the entire company are more aware of the importance of product quality in order to prevent future problems. The employees are more involved and understanding when it comes to changes within the company.</p>\r\n<p>&Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska did see signs before it reacted and could have initiated the process faster. Karin Claesson believes it could have foreseen the problem earlier if it had done an analysis of the global financial situation and acted more proactively. Today managers talk about these issues and discuss the situation in Greece, Germany and China and how it can affect their business. This was not the case back in 2008.</p>\r\n<p>Today 14% of workers are women and the average age is 44 years old; before restructuring 22% of the workers were women and the average age was 40 years old. Many of the younger employees in 2008 were the ones that had to leave during the restructuring, which has made the average age of the workforce higher today than it used to be. Before restructuring the company had 65 blue-collar employees and ten white-collar employees: today there are just 55 blue-collar employees left.</p>\r\n<p>Karin Claesson had, before the crisis, focused on creating teams and had frequent meetings to unify the workers and create a good working atmosphere. When the notices were announced, the employees were not angry, just sad at having to leave the working team. The ones who left the company continued to visit and the door was always open to them.</p>\r\n<p>As has been mentioned, &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska used the coaching company Startkraft in order to motivate and help those employees given notice to get new jobs. One employee got a new position at another company right away, another was at retirement age. However, most were young and no-one was willing to leave voluntarily, however they did not blame &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska as they knew there were no other options.</p>\r\n<p>Looking back, the restructuring has had a positive impact on the company. Today everyone is more aware of the vision of the company and the work atmosphere has changed for the better. The education opportunity arising from the ESF financial support has created an incentive for workers to improve their skills. Meanwhile the company has gained from the improved skills and innovation opportunities have increased due to this investment. Also workers that improve their competences are more likely to stay at the company which means the workforce is getting more stable. Employee turnover is nowhere near what it was in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>The company has also become more careful when employing new workers since it knows it might be difficult to go through another restructuring. Today, it hires workers only after a period of testing and supervision. It also outsources a lot more today than before, using staffing agency personnel, who might be recruited later on a permanent contract when the company knows it can rely on this employee and his/her competences.</p>\r\n<p>Today the firm has better links to trade unions than it did during the restructuring. If it could change anything about the restructuring process it would be to ask for another negotiator, as the person who was appointed in 2008 did not understand their situation. If Ms Claesson could have the chance to go through the process all over again she would have demanded another negotiator and not finish the negotiations as early. Maybe then the firm would not have had to see its remaining workers exhausted because the employees it really needed were made redundant.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Outcomes of restructuring according to an employee</strong></p>\r\n<p>Evelina Stillersson is 37 years old and has worked in the stores department at &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska since 2008. Before starting at &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska she had worked at a gas station for 6.5 years and within the childcare sector, so her prior work experience was in SMEs and the public service.</p>\r\n<p>Since Ms Stillersson had been taken on at the time of the restructuring she was worried she would be made redundant. Her fears proved groundless, but she explains that she, as well as most employees at &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska, was affected by the restructuring because many feared they would lose their jobs and were worried about their future at the company.</p>\r\n<p>During the process they were offered the opportunity to talk to Karin Claesson if they had any concerns or questions and the relation between the managers and the workers was good during the restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>No employees, apart from one trade union representative, were involved in the decisions; however, she concludes the employees had trust in the managers and that they always got the information they requested. The workers were kept in the loop during the process. The company also informed those workers who were about to be made redundant, before the Christmas holiday, so that the workers knew what would happen after the vacation. The employees who were given notices were sad of course; however, the remaining three quarters of the workforce could go home for Christmas with a good message.</p>\r\n<p>Whether the change has benefited the company is hard to say, though Ms Stillersson believes that it was a necessary action to take. Most employees got to keep their jobs and today they have even hired new employees so it was probably a positive restructuring for the company in the long run. Ms Stillersson believes that employees given notice were offered some support and it was all handled well. Ms Stillersson emphasises she can only speak on behalf of herself and she is satisfied with the handling of the restructuring. The remaining workforce are very grateful for being able to keep their jobs. Today, they value their positions more and are thankful for being able to stay at &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska. According to Ms Stillersson larger companies probably have more experience of restructuring and therefore a routine on what actions to take. That is an advantage for larger companies. However SMEs most certainly have a more personal relationship with employees, which makes the restructuring process easier to understand. In a small company where everyone knows everyone else and the managers say hello to everyone daily, the workers probably have more understanding of the situation and accept that restructuring is necessary. Giving notice in an SME is probably not as mechanical for the managers as it is in larger companies, and this can be both an advantage and a disadvantage for SMEs in restructuring, according to Evelina Stillersson.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Karin Claesson would recommend that every SME be aware that the situation for SMEs is constantly changing and that they should be prepared for this. Her advice is always to create strategies and practical policies on how to act in difficult situations and be prepared before they occur. One recommendation is always to try to avoid dependency on just a few clients; another is to prepare employees by informing them on topics such as terms of notice and responsibilities. She stresses that one should always make that kind of information available to everyone but one should always also be careful not to exaggerate the situation and create unnecessary caution and insecurity.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned, Ms Claesson would have asked for a different negotiator if she had the opportunity again. Therefore, she emphasises the importance of good relations with the trade unions in order to make the restructuring process easier. It is also of vital importance that negotiators are familiar with the business in order to generate the best possible result.</p>\r\n<p>It can be a challenge for SMEs when they temporarily have no work for someone and yet know this competence will be needed in the future. One solution to this, mentioned by Karin Claesson, is to make agree with an employee that he/she may leave and work for a staffing agency and then return to the company when the business is strong again. This kind of solution is easier and more relevant for small companies who know all of their employees personally. Also, SMEs have a better overview of their workforce since they are smaller and can therefore more easily see the consequences of restructuring. They always know who has been given notice and they have the phone number in case they want to rehire that person. This is an advantage for SMEs.</p>\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Jan Persson and Ingrid Broman, Oxford Research</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>Karin Claesson, Human Resources Manager</p>\r\n<p>Evelina Stillersson, employee, &Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniska</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company address</strong></p>\r\n<p>&Ouml;desh&ouml;gs Mekaniskasecurity</p>\r\n<p>Industrigatan 12</p>\r\n<p>599 33 &Ouml;desh&ouml;g</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company website</strong></p>\r\n<p>http://www.omek.org/</p>"~"Sweden"~"25 - manufacture of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2012-03-01"
"OMB Composites EU, Czech Republic"~"OMB Composites EU, a.s."~"<p>The restructuring in this Czech manufacturing parts company helped it to withstand the impact of the economic crisis. The internal restructuring process was completed according to management expectations and resulted in considerable business expansion. A new, more effective, organisational structure was implemented and the number of customers was increased from two to 13, thus decreasing the company&rsquo;s dependence on two key customers.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>OMB Composites EU a.s. is a Czech company that produces composite products which are used in various branches of the manufacturing industry, particularly in the automotive industry, transport, and agriculture, as well as in a number of non-manufacturing fields. The primary product manufactured is laminated components: mainly interior and exterior components used in the automotive industry (buses), automobile accessories, spoilers, and covers for construction machinery. Outside this field, it also produces covers for air conditioning units, shower units, and horse trailers.</p>\r\n<p>The company was established in 2006. It was built on the foundations of the Karel Klenor &ndash; KLN that was based in the nearby municipality of Choce<em>ň</em>. The company&rsquo;s current owner purchased the failing enterprise and, under the new name of OMB Composites EU, relocated it to the current manufacturing premises in Kr&aacute;l&iacute;ky. The main reason for purchasing the failing enterprise was because Karel Klenor &ndash; KLN was an important supplier to the bus manufacturing companies SOR Libchavy spol. S.r.o. and the Netherlands-based company VDL Berkhof. Therefore, the owner thought the company could achieve successful results by developing the already established contracts and relations.</p>\r\n<p>Milan Konečn&yacute;, the company&rsquo;s acting director, was interviewed for this case study. He does not have any ownership relation with the company. He joined the company in March 2009 following a request made by the company&rsquo;s owner, who wanted to reverse the negative developments in the manufacturing programme in place at OMB Composites EU. The company&rsquo;s management had just restarted production and was delivering products to bus manufacturers, but was not able to generate new growth. Mr Konečn&yacute; gained extensive managerial experience from the Royan Classic a.s. textile company, which he headed for nine years. That particular company was established when it was split from another textile company, Mosilana a.s. As a result, Mr Konečn&yacute; also has a certain amount of experience with restructuring and the associated processes. In spite of the entirely different nature of Mr Konečn&yacute;&rsquo;s former workplaces, the acting director soon adapted to the conditions at OMB Composites . Mr Konečn&yacute; has successfully completed his vocational education.</p>\r\n<p>After his arrival at the company, Mr Konečn&yacute; began to create a new company structure, in which the ownership structure is separate from operations. Two levels of management were introduced, in which the company&rsquo;s sole owner is the chairman of the board of directors (which consists of three members including the chairman), with the acting director in the person of Mr Konečn&yacute; at the level immediately below him. At the beginning of 2012, the company had approximately 100 employees, who tended to fall into the younger age groups. The majority of the employees are Czech; however the company also has a significant number of Polish and Ukrainian employees.</p>\r\n<p>The company not only focuses on the domestic market but is also successfully establishing business relationships with companies abroad. For this reason, it is expected that exports will start to take on a larger share of the company&rsquo;s total production volume. The current foreign markets include the Netherlands, Germany and Austria, to which the company supplies components made specifically for buses. It is therefore possible to characterise the company as an international enterprise. It exports the majority of its production volume to European Union markets (55%). The remainder is produced for the domestic market. OMB Composites EU does not export any products outside of the EU.</p>\r\n<p>The company does not have a specifically formulated human resource development plan. Requirements are addressed on an ad hoc basis. As far as the hiring of new employees is concerned, the company prefers employees who have a secondary school education due to the complexity of the production programme. Employees have to work with blueprints and must be able to read them. One example of an ad hoc solution to a problem is the training that was provided for reading blueprints by a retired acquaintance of the executive director. The company does not have a corporate social responsibility strategy, but it makes contributions to life insurance on behalf of its employees according to the number of years they have worked. The company does not have a works committee and no labour unions are represented.</p>\r\n<p>In 2008, the company had turnover of approximately CZK 60 million (approximately &euro;2.3 million). Since 2009, the company&rsquo;s turnover has been increasing year-on-year by approximately 15%. The company expects turnover to reach CZK 112 million in 2012 (&euro;4.5 million) and its long-term objective is to achieve a turnover of CZK 250 million (&euro;10 million).</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008, the company was in a bad state due to the incompetence of the previous management. The company was in a downward slide towards negative figures, not because of the global economic crisis (which started in the CR in 2009) but mostly because of the high fluctuation of employees and low workforce productivity. Any expansion under the management of that time could not even be considered. Another problem that existed under the former management was the poor quality of production, which resulted in the Netherlands-based VDL Berkhof decreasing the volume of its orders for the products manufactured by OMB Composites EU. Under the previous management, the company had many Ukrainian and Polish employees, which led the local people to make many unjustified, prejudiced assumptions. This affected the recruitment of new workers as local people were not keen to work in the OMB Composites EU. In addition, approximately half of the company&rsquo;s employees were temporary agency workers, which resulted in great fluctuations in employee turnover and and a corresponding decrease of the company business results because of the low quality of work which led to a high rejection rate. Such were the conditions at the beginning of two restructuring events.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring processes took place between 2009 and 2011. The first was internal; the second was the business expansion.</p>\r\n<p>The internal reorganisation was initiated by the company&rsquo;s owner, who recognised the incompetence of the previous management at the end of 2008. In 2009 he appointed Mr Konečn&yacute; to the position of acting director. Mr Konečn&yacute; implemented a significant reorganisation of the company&rsquo;s structure. New sections were established as a part of the reorganisation, such as the modelling section and the sales section, which can more effectively address issues associated with the company&rsquo;s development. He increased the headcount of the company&rsquo;s technical and administrative workers, as the number of employees at the time was insufficient for the company&rsquo;s expansion. Before the reorganisation there were eight employees (of whom six were made redundant), now there are 17. The recruitment of new technical and administrative staff was not easy, as in Kralice there was a lack of sufficiently experienced people. However, after a short fluctuation of employees in this section the number of staff has stabilised. All new technical and administrative workers are permanent employees of the company.</p>\r\n<p>As a consequence of internal reorganisation, the standard organisational structure with which he was familiar from other companies was introduced. Although the company did hold ISO certification, this system did not work in practice and Mr Konečn&yacute; placed great emphasis on the actual implementation of the system (the implementation of the system was announced by Mr Konečn&yacute; to workers immediately after his appointment). This implementation has led to a reorganisation of all the company&rsquo;s activities. The situation has improved, especially in the management of quality. The implementation has brought also benefits for the workers as their role and work competencies were better specified and they could realise their contribution to the performance of the company. The reorganisation brought about some redeployment and training of a few employees (as the organisational changes were mostly administrative, they did not influence the job descriptions of most of workers). Also training for new employees of management had to be provided. As the employees felt that the situation in the company was getting better after the appointment of Mr Konečn&yacute;, the redeployment and new training were accepted positively.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Konečn&yacute; also had to change the company&rsquo;s image quite significantly. For this reason, he changed the company&rsquo;s employee structure so that the majority of employees are permanently employed and of the Czech origin, which had a positive effect on the recruitment of new employees. Capable temporary agency workers got a permanent contract in the company, the rest were made redundant. The company currently has only two temporary agency workers.</p>\r\n<p>The entire reorganisation of the company started in 2009, when Mr Konečn&yacute; joined the company, and ended at the end of 2011, when the new company structure was stabilised.</p>\r\n<p>The newly prepared organisational structure was used as the basis for the company&rsquo;s further expansion. Mr Konečn&yacute; set a goal to increase the added value of production and to increase the number of companies to which OMB Composites EU delivers its products. In order to improve the company&rsquo;s marketing position, not only was an ISO certificate confirmed (there was a threat that company would lose the certificate because most of the measures it required were not practised under the former management), but the company also acquired trade-specific certificates issued to suppliers of components for military technology and railway vehicles. At this time, the company is striving to obtain IRIS (International Railway Industry Standard) certification, which would facilitate further expansion within the market (for example, this certificate is required by Bombardier, a company that has contacted OMB Composites EU in the past), as well as a certificate for producing laminated iron components.</p>\r\n<p>The company is on its way to achieving its goal of added value and the expansion of its product portfolio through several steps. The newest effort is the offer to customers of the installation of small iron components into laminated parts, which makes the installation of components much easier at the customer&rsquo;s facilities. OMB Composites EU also offers varnished plastic parts, which is yet another way in which the company is responding to various customer requirements. The main step required for further business expansion is the purchase of a milling and cutting machine, which will make it possible to improve significantly the company&rsquo;s current production methods, both with regard to the quality of cutting as well as the production of models. A measuring centre will also be installed. The operating space required for the new machine however, requires the construction of a new hall, which will subsequently house the entire completion and development division.</p>\r\n<p>The purchase of the new machine, which will be funded from public resources, will make it possible to cut and model (mill) laminate. This ability is crucial for the company&rsquo;s further development, as it will be able to perform the entire manufacturing process for laminated components. Up to now, the company has to work in cooperation with other companies, which sometimes leads to unexpected delays with deliveries. In addition, by being able to perform the entire manufacturing process, the company will gain a competitive advantage, as there is currently no company in the Czech Republic that offers anything comparable for laminated components.</p>\r\n<p>A specific restructuring plan and time schedule have not been prepared and the new management has the owner&rsquo;s complete trust with regard to performing the required steps. Nevertheless, even these steps had to be discussed with the owner from time to time, as the owner was responsible for obtaining the financial resources required to implement the restructuring. In addition to using the company&rsquo;s own resources, the restructuring was financed through bank loans (the construction of the new hall) and public resources. The negotiations of the bank loans were not difficult. The purchase of the new milling and cutting machine was partially funded with a CZK 5 million (&euro;200,000) subsidy from the Enterprise and Innovation Operational Programme, which covered approximately half of the costs.</p>\r\n<p>The new company structure also greatly improved communication with the employees. This has had a positive effect on how informed the employees are about the changes that are in the preparatory stages. In addition to weekly meetings between management and the production section, specifically focused meetings are also held with the staff with the participation of the entire management team. It was at such meetings that employees were informed about the planned restructuring events.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Mr Konečn&yacute; considers small and medium-sized enterprises to be more flexible, however he sees a disadvantage in the fact that they have less access to credit (he cites the construction of the new hall as an example). In retrospect, he would like to improve work with human resources - both concerning employees&rsquo; recruitment and training.</p>\r\n<p>He has one reservation with regard to support for restructuring provided from public funds: the process for granting a subsidy takes too long. In the case of the purchase of the new machinery with funding from the Industry and Enterprise Operational Programme, it took one year and one month from the date the subsidy application was submitted to the time that the financing agreement was signed. This length of time is unacceptable when one is trying to complete the restructuring as quickly as possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Other than financial assistance, the management of OMB Composites EU did not feel the need to receive any other form of support, for example, the provision of information. In addition to the aforementioned Operational Programme, the Town of Kr&aacute;l&iacute;ky and the local employment office also provided assistance during the restructuring process, as they are aware of how important this particular employer is for the economy of their region, which suffers from a high unemployment rate. For example, the Town Hall helped to make the arrangements for space where job seekers, identified by the local employment office as potential OMB Composites EU employees, could access company-financed training.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The internal restructuring process was completed according to the expectations of the company&rsquo;s owners and management and it has resulted in its business expansion. A new, more effective, organisational structure was implemented and the number of customers was increased from two (SOR Libchavy and VDL Berkhof) to 13, thus decreasing the company&rsquo;s dependence on two key customers. As a result, the company barely felt the impact of the economic crisis.</p>\r\n<p>The portfolio of the company started to be gradually expanded in 2009, but the main initiating factor for further business expansion was the launch of operations in the new hall, scheduled for completion end of 2012. It is expected that this step will lead to an increase in production volume from 42,000 pieces to 51,000 pieces per year.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to the restructuring, the company had 56 employees (at the start of 2009). At the beginning of 2012, there are almost 100 employees and, due to the implementation of new technologies, an additional 40 will be hired at the beginning of 2013. Based on the company&rsquo;s plan, the company might have up to 170 workers by 2013&ndash;2014.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring did not in any way affect the length of working hours. The restructuring was seen as positive; however, some local inhabitants voiced certain doubts about building the new hall during an economic crisis. Only the future will show whether these concerns were justified. Generally, the implications on the employees of the company are positive. The reorganisation of the company led to the more effective organisation of work which was positively accepted both by employees in management and production. Business expansion of OMB Composites EU has stabilised the jobs and also enabled the growth of salaries.</p>\r\n<p>As far as the plans for the future are concerned, the company would like to increase its share of the laminated components it provides to its customers. At this time, the company delivers, on average, only approximately 5% of its customers&rsquo; total requirements for laminated products (with the exception of SOR Libchavy, to whom it delivers 25%). The company would like to achieve an average share of 10%, whether by pushing out its competitors or through delivering partially completed laminated components, such as iron parts and servo drives. The company would also like to develop an education system for its employees and to expand outside of the European Union. Expansion to Russia is currently being planned in cooperation with SOR Libchavy. Mr Konečn&yacute; would like to take advantage of his significant social capital during this expansion.</p>\r\n<p>Vasil Kotovskij, the representative from the production side, is a 34-year-old Ukrainian who is the lead worker in the &lsquo;lamination&rsquo; section. He has been employed at the company for three and a half years. Initially, he was a temporary agency employee, but he gradually worked his way up to his current position. As far as his work experience is concerned, in Ukraine he worked for ENO (a company with 2,500 employees) for six years and managed a division with 70 employees.</p>\r\n<p>In his opinion, the restructuring brought many changes that were all for the good: his salary increased (as did the salaries of other employees which increased by 15%&ndash;18% as a reflection of improvement of the business performance), he moved up in the company hierarchy whilst being able to keep the same working hours, and communication with management improved. According to Mr Kotovskij, the company now holds meetings about the slightest details. He has no problems with his subordinates or with his supervisors.</p>\r\n<p>Over the course of the restructuring process, the employees were always made aware of any upcoming changes in the company and they always had the opportunity to voice their opinions. Mr Kotovskij said that at first the employees were somewhat uncertain and there was a lack of trust with regard to the planned changes. However, once they discovered the benefits these changes would bring for the company and for its employees, their concerns abated. In his opinion, an explanation of the restructuring measures is necessary and contributes towards the smooth transition to the new production methods. Mr Kotovskij had no specific comments to make about the actual restructuring changes and their implementation.</p>\r\n<p>Lenka Str&aacute;sk&aacute; aged 31, is an employee of the Asset Administration and Management and Quality Management Division. She previously worked as assistant to the manager for quality at Autoliv Stakupress s.r.o. in Kr&aacute;l&iacute;ky. Ms Str&aacute;sk&aacute; has witnessed significant changes within the company and she also actively participated in the implementation process for the reorganisation, during which she drew on the abundant experience she had from her previous job. In the former company she worked as human resources manager, therefore she helped significantly with the training of new employees.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Str&aacute;sk&aacute; considers all of the changes from the restructuring to be positive. According to her, the only problem that arose in this respect occurred in relation to the recruitment of new workers as, even in a region with a high unemployment rate, it is difficult to find sufficiently qualified workers, despite the fact that people applied from as far away as Poland.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Mr Konečn&yacute; recommends SMEs who are in the process of preparing restructuring to be proactive and not to be afraid of risk.</p>\r\n<h2>Authors</h2>\r\n<p>Vladan Hru&scaron;ka and Petr Bučina, RegioPartner sro.</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>Milan Konečn&yacute;, acting director of OMB Composites EU,</p>\r\n<p>Lenka Str&aacute;sk&aacute; and Vasil Kotovskij, employees of OMB Composites EU</p>\r\n<p><strong>Company website</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.ombcomposites.cz/ombcomposites.cz/o-nas.html"">http://www.ombcomposites.cz/ombcomposites.cz/o-nas.html</a></p>"~"Czech Republic"~"22 - manufacture of rubber and plastic products"~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2012-03-08"
"Omega Dairy Products, Cyprus"~"Omega Dairy Products Ltd"~"<p>The outsourcing in the Cypriot firm Omega Dairy Products [not its real name] negatively influenced the company performance. This happened because a subcontractor who had been given lower prices did not, as agreed, make early payments in exchange.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Omega Dairy Products Ltd is a company operating in the dairy manufacturing sector in Cyprus, producing traditional dairy products such as halloumi (a semi-hard, unripened brined <a HREF=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese"">cheese</a>), anari (a soft Ricotta-like cheese made from whey), and yoghurt. It should be noted that Omega is an assumed name, and the actual names of the company and persons mentioned in this report are not disclosed at the request of the owner/managers. </p>\r\n<p>The company was founded in 1960. The shareholders are two brothers, having equal ownership. They acquired Omega Dairies in 1980, a company that was owned and managed by a different family. The brothers decided to acquire Omega because their parents were engaged in the domestic, small-scale production of dairy products and they were used to this kind of work. They had always wanted to have their own business in producing traditional Cypriot dairy products and to keep alive their family tradition. Acquiring Omega (as opposed to establishing a new business) offered a means to capitalise on a business that already had an established reputation and access to retail channels. </p>\r\n<p>The general manager of the company is one of the brothers, who has a mechanical engineering background and who had previously been in charge of a major paper product manufacturer. This is a first-generation family business, involving both its senior and the junior generations. One brother has a son who is in charge of production, while the other has a daughter and a son that are involved in  sales. </p>\r\n<p>The organisational structure of Omega Dairies Ltd is that, at the top of the hierarchy is one of the brothers, the general manager, who also is the quality manager. Other key company managers include the production manager (son of the general manager), the head of the maintenance department, and the sales and marketing manager (the other brother). Another key department is the accounting department.</p>\r\n<p>The company employs 35 individuals, mainly semi-skilled, the majority being female (around 60%). The employees are not represented by any works council or trade union. The company has a production capacity of around six million litres of milk annually, aiming to increase this by greater expansion into markets within the EU. Omega is an international company, with 70% of total production being exported. Markets abroad currently being served include the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Greece, Finland, and Estonia.</p>\r\n<p>Cyprus’ accession to the EU in 2004, as well as the efforts of the management to facilitate further company growth, led to a number of changes being introduced. These included:</p>\r\n<p>•	establishing a new factory in the late 1990s;</p>\r\n<p>•	reengineering key processes and systems as part of the harmonisation with respective EU regulations in 2003;</p>\r\n<p>•	the acquisition of new machinery and the expansion of production capacity in 2005 due to the initiation of exports</p>\r\n<p>•	the decision to subcontract a part of product distribution in 2010. </p>\r\n<p>Since 2005, when the company started exporting, there has been an impressive growth in company revenues. While in 2005 total revenues were €2 million, in 2011 annual revenues reached €5.5 million. This is translated into a 16.7% average annual growth in revenues between 2005 and 2011. As for the profitability, between 2005 and 2010, the company had a 3% average annual growth in net profits. 2011, however, was the first year that the company recorded losses. There was a 1% net loss, partly due to the financial crisis, the unsuccessful restructuring that the company undertook (described later) and the fact that the company invested in new machinery and equipment acquisition during 2011.</p>\r\n<p><b>Background to restructuring event</b></p>\r\n<p>In January 2010, the company decided to outsource a part of its product distribution to an external provider. The agreement established between the two parties allowed Epsilon Ltd (an assumed name) to distribute and sell Omega’s dairy products to retail outlets around the country. Omega, though, kept the distribution and sales of its products to other clients, mainly wholesalers, including exports abroad. This meant that approximately 50% of total distribution on a local basis would be facilitated by Epsilon. </p>\r\n<p>The company decided to outsource the retail distribution function as a means of avoiding the excessive costs associated with maintaining an extensive distribution network and concentrating efforts in key practices such as production and export. In this way, the company would be able to realise its dual aim of both cost minimisation (that is efficiency) and further company growth. Another reason for this decision was the credit crunch, which started becoming evident during 2009. This led to a number of retailers not paying on time, with many major retail chains paying six months after they received products from manufacturers. </p>\r\n<p>As part of this restructuring event, the two parties agreed that Epsilon would buy the products at a discounted rate from Omega, while paying the manufacturer within 75 days. In this way, Omega was aspiring to solve the problem of late payments and have a healthier cash flow to run the company. </p>\r\n<p><b>Restructuring processes </b></p>\r\n<p>The agreement between Omega and Epsilon needed three months, in total, to be finalised. The restructuring process started in January 2010 and ended in March 2010. The decision to outsource retail distribution was made with little planning. As emphasised by the owner/manager being interviewed, while this decision was on the table for a period of time, the decision to outsource was mainly driven by the increasing pressure of late payments in the market and the restrictions that this created in facilitating further company growth. It was just a month before the actual negotiations with the provider, that Omega’s management decided to outsource retail distribution. </p>\r\n<p>The choice of outsourcing distribution had been considered by the management for some years. The idea was that this would help the company in focusing on more core activities that was the production of dairy products and further company expansion through exports abroad. According to the general manager, some companies had previously approached Omega with offers to take over the retail distribution of their products. However, as he emphasised, it was after getting exposed in the credit pressures of the market during 2009 that they actually started thinking seriously about this option. During this year, Omega was approached by Epsilon, a newly established business. Epsilon was set up as a company for the purpose of being a mediator between manufacturers and retailers. Taking advantage of the upcoming crisis, Epsilon targeted a number of manufacturers that it felt would be willing to outsource their retail distribution function. To induce them to cooperate, Epsilon promised it could help manufacturers receive money on time for their sales. Omega, which at that time was receiving money from retailers 180–200 days after delivery, was persuaded to collaborate by Epsilon who assured that payments would be received within 75 days. </p>\r\n<p>The agreement between Omega and Epsilon came about as a result of negotiations between the management of the two companies. The person in charge of the negotiations on behalf of Omega was the general manager, who was engaged in the needed discussions with Epsilon for the finalisation of the outsourcing agreement. Both sides put on the table their requirements, which were thoroughly discussed for reaching common points of agreement. Omega went to the negotiations with a concern around late payments, aiming to establish an agreement that would allow them to receive money from the sales of their products within 60 days. On the other hand, Epsilon was looking into an agreement that would allow them a satisfactory profit margin from Omega sales. The end of the negotiations led both parties in satisfying their concerns. Under the agreement between the two parties, Omega would receive payments within 75 days and Epsilon was satisfied by the prices offered by Omega on their products. </p>\r\n<p>No formal plans were in place to accompany the restructuring event. The only formal aspect of the whole restructuring process was the contract that was decided and signed between the two parties. Omega’s management did not engage in any formal planning that would accompany the implementation of the restructuring event. This was primarily informal. Problems and complexities were mostly tackled on a reactive basis. However, as it was emphasised in the interviews, no major difficulties were met throughout the restructuring process. </p>\r\n<p>Employees were informed about the outsourcing after the finalisation of the agreement, during an intra-company training session where all employees were involved. There was no particular reaction on the part of employees, who showed no resistance to the decision of the owners to outsource the retail distribution. The fact that the business managed this change with extra care was a reason for not experiencing any reaction. According to the general manager, the employees were reassured constantly that no changes would affect the way each person carried out their  tasks. However, three employees were laid off as a result of the restructuring and one employee that had to be moved to  production. All these individuals had been  occupied in product distribution to retail channels. Though a sensitive issue, the company managed to deal with this successfully. Financial compensation was provided to those employees laid off, and successful efforts were made to secure employment for them in other businesses. During the interviews, the general manager mentioned that these employees seemed to have understood the situation and the reasons behind the termination of their employment. The management of the company had discussions with each of these employees separately, explaining the situation in detail and assuring them they would provide all the necessary financial and other support. This extra care helped avoid any reaction from other employees. </p>\r\n<p>Employees were excluded from the restructuring process and relevant decisions within. No consultation with employees took place as part of this process. The three employees laid off were informed after the finalisation of the agreement with Epsilon, and after careful discussion between the company’s managers. All three employees were given a month’s notice prior to terminating their employment. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Difficulties in the course of the restructuring process were mainly financially related. The first thing the company needed to secure during this process was the bank guarantees of the agreement. This took time, since Omega wanted to obtain bank guarantees from the contracting party (that is, Epsilon) prior of finalising the agreement. This was to make sure that Epsilon would fulfil its obligations as a contracting party and to insure Omega from loss or damage due to non-performance by Epsilon. As emphasised by the owner–manager interviewed, such guarantees are essential at the early start of an agreement, and it is through time that trust between contracting parties is built. In this way, Omega felt sure that the subcontractor would be able to fulfil its contractual obligations.</p>\r\n<p><b>Restructuring advice and support </b></p>\r\n<p>Omega’s management received no particular financial or non-financial support in its efforts to finalise the outsourcing agreement. In fact, all negotiations and decisions were made by the general manager, while consulting other members of the owning family such as his brother and their children involved in business. The fact that all the family was supporting the general manager and was embracing all his choices was very important in taking the final decision to outsource the retail distribution function of the business. This made the general feel more confident in taking actions on this matter. However,  he mentioned the drawback that the family had no specialised knowledge of outsourcing issues. As a result, much of the support that he was getting from other family members was mainly psychological. </p>\r\n<p>The costs of outsourcing were covered in full by the contracting parties. In fact, Omega did not have any significant costs, since no investments were necessary. The only costs involved related to compensation for the employees that were laid off. </p>\r\n<p>No governmental or EU schemes were available, at that time, to support such a restructuring. The owner–manager mentioned that their needs were of a financial nature, but that there was a need for proper advice and consultancy support for making sure that restructuring would be conducted the right way.</p>\r\n<p>Restructuring advice was desirable at the time of the negotiations and the whole restructuring process. However, while it was acknowledged that external support from specialist consultants would be particularly useful in managing the whole process, the management decided against this option as it wanted to minimise costs. </p>\r\n<p><b>Outcomes of restructuring </b></p>\r\n<p>Prior to outsourcing, the company received money owed by clients within 180 to 200 days. The aim of the company was that the contractual agreement with Epsilon would allow Omega to collect money within 75 days. However, the outcomes of the restructuring were not as expected. As emphasised by the general manager, cash was hardly ever received within 75 days, since the subcontractor was also facing a lot of difficulties in receiving money on time. As a result, the planned financial gains for the company were never met, and indeed the decision to outsource the retail distribution brought additional problems for Omega, such as further cash flow problems and reduced profitability. While the managers expected to collect receivables much earlier (that is, within 75 days), they found themselves in a similar situation to the pre-restructuring period, collecting cash after 150 days. However, the fact that products were now supplied at a lower price to the subcontractor meant that the company faced an additional financial burden as revenues and profits were lower than before. In fact, the performance of the company was influenced negatively, and this was one of the reasons for the net loss that the company exhibited for the first time since 1980. The company was facing a dilemma at the time of the interviews, looking into various options that would help remedy the situation. The general manager mentioned that returning back to wholly controlled retail distribution would not solve this problem, emphasising that they were in such a difficult financial situation that they might also start considering selling the business. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring event brought changes to employee structure and staffing. As mentioned, three people were laid off. These included individuals employed in  distribution, which was outsourced. At the same time, a fourth person was relocated to the production department, as a result of the company’s efforts to strengthen this division. No negative consequences resulted for the business as a result of the need to lay off employees. Since the business provided financial compensations to these employees and exhibited a willingness to help them find employment elsewhere, this was seen positively not only by the affected individuals but from all the company employees.. Indeed, the Omega management persuaded Epsilon to recruit one of these three individuals while, after communication with companies in Omega’s network, jobs were secured for the other two.</p>\r\n<p>The general manager acknowledged that a number of lessons were learnt from this restructuring. In fact, he presented this event as a failure that has to be the driving force of future actions. The management team, in fact, failed to realise the planned scenario of collecting receivables within 75 days and this led to a further worsening of the financial condition of the company. He mentioned that this ‘failure’ led him to reflect on the mistakes that were made in the course of the outsourcing decision and the agreement with Epsilon. He emphasised that next time around he would formally plan such actions, while asking for the support of specialist consultants in undertaking a formal evaluation prior to the event, and in participating in the actual negotiations. This would help to minimise pitfalls after the implementation of the agreement. </p>\r\n<p><b>Commentary </b></p>\r\n<p>This case study provides useful lessons that can be considered by businesses during restructuring events. While Omega’s management was aspiring to obtain faster payments and thus better cash flow management through outsourcing the retail distribution function, things did not go as planned. One reason for the failure to facilitate changes that would help to improve competitiveness appears to be that the management failed to appreciate the complexities involved in the particular restructuring event. Reflecting on the agreement made with the subcontractor and the process that they went through to materialise this restructuring, the management admitted that the idea to outsource might have been a big mistake. </p>\r\n<p>The failure of Omega’s management reveals major issues that need to be considered during business restructuring. The first was the hasty decision to move on with business restructuring without proper preparation. Omega’s management appeared to have undervalued the significance of preparation prior to negotiations. Such preparation could have included a feasibility study, due diligence for a thorough investigation of the contracting party, and proper planning that would help set the foundations for the effective implementation of restructuring and the management of change. Simulation and sensitivity analysis would again help obtain a complete understanding of different scenarios in the agreement, prior to its enforcement. These tools could help management to gain a thorough understanding of the situation and decide: first, whether restructuring would be wise and, second, how this process could ideally be managed.</p>\r\n<p>The second major issue that stems from the case is the fact that formal agreements may not necessarily bind two parties in a mutually acceptable performance. While there was agreement on behalf of Epsilon to pay within 75 days, this clause was never met and this was one of the reasons for Omega experiencing losses after the restructuring. An option for Omega was to terminate the contract with Epsilon. But the general manager did not see this as viable since the company would need to invest in reorganising product distribution. As a result, the company chose to do nothing and therefore experienced losses and cash flow problems as a result of the late payments by Epsilon. This could have been avoided, however, if Omega’s management had fully understood the decision to outsource and the risks associated with it. One option to avoid this would have been for the company to have had a back-up or reaction plan in the event that the subcontractor would not meet the terms of  the initial agreement. </p>\r\n<p>As emphasised by the general manager during the interviews, Omega asked from Epsilon certain bank guarantees prior to the agreement. While these were met, Omega did not exercise the right to claim money as a result of the unsatisfactory performance by the subcontractor. This was not made on due to fears about the uncertainly that would unfold in the case of the termination of the agreement with Epsilon. A back-up plan, however, could have outlined the next steps in case of such a scenario and would have helped the Omega’s management to take the necessary steps to minimise potential losses for the company. In this case, it could perhaps have been wise for Omega’s management to ask for the help of an experienced consultant in order to avoid the risks of such a negative scenario. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Panikkos Poutziouris and Elias Hadjielias, UCLan Cyprus </p>\r\n<p>Milena Marinova, Zateons Associates, Business Advisors </p>\r\n<p><b>Information sources </b></p>\r\n<p><b>Interview</b></p>\r\n<p>General owner/manager of Omega Dairy Products Ltd, Cyprus</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Cyprus"~"10 - manufacture of food products"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"outsourcing"~"2012-01-16"
"Paltentaler Minerals, Austria"~"Paltentaler Minerals GmbH & Co KG"~"<p>When Austrian company Paltentaler Minerals was taken over by new owners, the goods produced at that time were also bought. However, these were not deemed competitive by the new owners, making them opt for an internal restructuring related to investments in research and development and product developments. The resulting innovations necessitated an expansion of production capacity with an additional production plant.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The company Paltentaler Minerals, located in Styria in south-east Austria, produces finely ground multifunctional minerals for various industrial applications, such as in the plastics industry or for varnishes, paints, plaster or mortar. The company positions itself as a niche player, offering specialised products realising sufficiently high margins. Due to the small size of the enterprise, they do not offer mass products in order to avoid having to compete with large enterprises in the industry.</p>\r\n<p>The company has been in existence for more than 100 years. In 1 July 2007, the company was taken over by the Paltentaler holding. The holding owns 90% of the enterprise and the remaining 10% is owned by the CEO who entered the business with the take-over. The holding consists of several small firms with in total about 200 employees. Each company is fully responsible for itself, all company decisions are independently taken at enterprise level. The involvement in the holding is purely organisational, with a few centralised elements (for example, there is a centralised IT system for all the companies), but there is, also for example, no joint balancing of accounts.</p>\r\n<p>As of spring 2012, Paltentaler Minerals was employing 25 employees, including two apprentices, who are active in research and development, production, quality assurance, sales and technical advice, marketing, customer service, accounting and housekeeping. Consequently, there is a broad variety of competences and skills, but each task is filled by one person only, in line with the small size of the company. However, all members of staff are sufficiently qualified and flexible to fulfil other tasks temporarily (for example, as holiday replacements). The company has a works council which was also involved in the restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>Paltentaler Minerals has several certifications (for example, quality management ISO 9001 and 14001, safety and health management system according to OHSAS 18001) and is keen to put these into practice in the company. Accordingly, a group of management and staff (‘team Paltentaler Minerals‘) is continuously working on the optimisation of the company approach towards quality, safety and ecology.</p>\r\n<p>In order to satisfy these self-imposed requirements, expansions and improvements regarding the processes and products have been established since the take-over. In 2007, the sales, production and research and development activities were increased, and in 2008 a new research and development laboratory was finished. In the field of research and development the firm cooperates with renowned research centres, as well as with its customers, to identify current trends and developments on the market and to tailor products to these.</p>\r\n<p>New mineral-based product lines were introduced in 2008 (‘indolo’) and 2010 (‘inzeo’, ‘intalc’). In 2010, the company also acquired shares of a Slovak mining company with about 15 staff. In 2011, a new mill building, an additional storage building and a drying plant were finished and a second grinding line put into operation. This expansion is described in this case study.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>When the company was taken over in 2007, the goods produced at that time were bought in. However, these were no longer competitive on the market, which was one of the reasons the original owner decided to sell the company.</p>\r\n<p>In the early years after the take-over, the new management invested a lot in research and development, to develop new products. These were presented on the market in 2010. At the same time two patents for new products and processes were registered. Consequently, it became obvious that for the optimal use of the newly developed processes and for the production of the innovations expansion of the production capacity was necessary. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The planning of the expansion through the additional, innovative production plant started in 2010 and was conducted solely within the enterprise, as part of the continuous expansion followed since the take-over, along with the wish to optimise products and processes.</p>\r\n<p>The development of the new products and processes was mainly done by company staff. However, the firm also cooperated with Austrian and German universities. Some projects were also developed with business partners/clients to make sure that their demands were fully met.</p>\r\n<p>The development process is described as ‘intensive’ by the management. The small enterprise uses about 20% of the sales income for research and development, which is a very high share. The restructuring resulted in a considerable increase in working time, particularly for the management.</p>\r\n<p>Some official authorisations were required for the structural changes. These were obtained simply and quickly, and the management describes this process as smooth.</p>\r\n<p>As the changes and expansion concerned all employees, the management considered communication with employees as one of the most important elements of the restructuring. The staff was informed from the very beginning, through staff assemblies and individual talks, depending on the particular need. The employees were strongly involved in the process, not only concerning product and process development, but also, for example, with regard to the construction supervision. Consequently, their tasks were temporarily widened. As the company is growing strongly, it can be assumed that this will also be the case in the future.</p>\r\n<p>During restructuring the company also invested in the education and training of its employees. This had both, an operative (for example, induction to the new production plant) and a strategic (for example, background knowledge for future product development) orientation. Both internal seminars as well as external courses were offered. These were financed by the employer as the time required for applying for public financial support was deemed to be too great, when set against the training expenses.</p>\r\n<p>The expansion and the higher level of flexibility thus expected from the employees was no problem for the majority of employees, and the atmosphere in the company did not deteriorate.</p>\r\n<p>The new production plant with its new procedures came into operation in 2011. There had been a strict timetable for the project, but this changed when a new product was developed for which there immediately was high demand, and the production plant under construction was enlarged. Consequently, the expansion took a bit longer and was more expensive (€2.8 million rather than €2.1 million) than initially planned. After the finalisation the company also invested in infrastructure (for example, asphalt coating, lawns), resulting in an overall total investment of €3 million. The adaptation was carried out in a flexible way because management felt it was necessary to adjust to market development.</p>\r\n<p>The initial plans for expansion were partly financed by company profits and partly through banks. Furthermore, because of the innovative character of the new production plant the company received public support. The external finance amounted to about 60% of the overall investment. The company did not receive any additional support for the additional expansion; this was completely financed by the firm itself.</p>\r\n<p>The holding company was in no way involved in the restructuring process, neither were the other linked companies. The reason for this lies in the independence of the individual enterprises. All of them have different products and follow strategies independent of the other firms. Accordingly, there is no possibility of, for example, taking advantage of know-how in other firms as these are active in completely different areas.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Due to the considerable changes the expansion/innovation brought about for nearly all jobs, there was a certain resistance on the part of some employees. In particular, the fact that the management expected a high level of independence and flexibility from the employees because of the small company size was not accepted by some staff, who decided to leave the company.</p>\r\n<p>The recruitment of the additional staff required because of the expansion was a challenge as it is difficult to make a decision suitable for both sides solely on the basis of written documents (CV) and one or few job interviews. Due to the small scale of the company and the high workload for the single manager it is important for him to find staff who work independently and on whom he can fully rely. In practice, it turned out that only an employee’s actually work shows whether they are suitable for the company and whether the working conditions in the firm are in line with the worker’s expectations.</p>\r\n<p>The lack of skilled workers is a problem, particularly for further expansion. For this reason the company has now decided to engage in apprenticeship training. However, the company is not satisfied with the qualifications of the youngsters they take on, and has introduced ‘personal coaching’ next to the normal apprenticeship training, fostering the general education (for example, mathematics, languages) of the apprentices through colleagues.</p>\r\n<p>Another challenge has been the time required for the application for public financial support </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Due to the innovative character of the planned production plant, the company received public financial support. This was a combination of regional (Styrian economic promotion) and national funds, cofinanced by EU funds. The management actively searched for such support, identified what they wanted and then approached the relevant authority. The preparation of the application was time-consuming and required a lot of work. The support granted was not available for the investment from the beginning as the first financial statement could be handed in only after half of the project had been completed. Consequently, the company had to organise an interim investment. This was, however, no problem as the management knew about this from the beginning and could arrange for it accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>The joint product and process development with Austrian and German universities was partly based on contacts that had already been established. However, the company also looked for new partners with specific skills. After these potential partners were identified, the company approached them; agreements were drawn up over the division of work and project design, and the projects were jointly realised.</p>\r\n<p>Except from the technical experts, no advisors were involved in the restructuring process. All administrative aspects (including tax-related ones) are dealt with by the manager. As there was nothing unusual about the restructuring process, he did not see any demand for additional support.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The company has expanded because it now has a new production plant as well as its original one. The new technology, in operation since June 2011, has meant even more innovative products can be produced and it is easier to meet the demands of individual customers.</p>\r\n<p>The management estimates that, without the expansion, there would have been a reduction in production in 2011, while now production has actually increased.</p>\r\n<p>The expansion resulted in a considerable change of nearly all jobs in the company (from technology to administration). For this reason the management felt the early involvement of all staff was very important. Nevertheless, some employees were not willing to adjust to the new way of working and left the company (four quit, one retired). The employer did not dismiss any staff.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the expansion 10 to 12 additional employees (net) were hired in research and development, production, systems engineering and programming. This means staff numbers have almost doubled since the takeover in 2007, when the company had 12 or 13 workers.</p>\r\n<p>Additional investment is planned, and further growth is expected.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The management considers the restructuring not only as a means of expanding its product portfolio, but also as a way of acquiring strategic development for the future and helping it to act flexibly on the market. It also expects flexibility from its employees, who if needed, must be able to fulfil tasks other than those required in their actual job. In exchange, they earn wages much higher than the industry average (this was the case even before the restructuring). Furthermore, an informal, personal work atmosphere, as well as proactive and continuous employee information, is seen as important success factor. The employees are seen as the most important capital of the company.</p>\r\n<p>The chosen development pathway has already proven successful and is followed further. Additional investment in product development and structural measures is planned.</p>\r\n<p>The management mentions the ‘intuition to do the right thing at the right time’ as an important success factor for the restructuring. Next to a strategic approach – for example, market monitoring and proactive orientation to customers’ needs – a successful company also has to have the support of the management and staff, and ‘a bit of luck’. </p>\r\n<p>The company’s close customer contacts and joint product development with them, was advantageous. Management felt the success of the restructuring was also due to the availability of good, timely advice from several sources. Here, not only the personal contacts of the management, but also those of the employees were invaluable. </p>\r\n<p>Management would like to see an improvement in the way public financial support is handled. The administration of loans and the bureaucracy involved can be very laborious, particularly for small companies. The manager also pinpoints a certain lack of individual, company specific orientation of private business consultants towards their individual clients, resulting in a price-value-ratio that was not satisfactory.</p>\r\n<p>Compared to large enterprises the management sees the advantage of small firms in the opportunity to specialise in niche markets and to make decisions quicker. A disadvantage is the limited political influence.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Irene Mandl, Eurofound</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><b>Interview</b> </p>\r\n<p>Bernhard Gutternigg, CEO and co-owner, Paltentaler Minerals </p>\r\n<p><b>Company address</b></p>\r\n<p>Paltentaler Minerals GmbH &amp; Co KG</p>\r\n<p>Moos 278903 Lassing</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.paltentaler-minerals.at/"">http://www.paltentaler-minerals.at/</a></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Austria"~"23 - manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products"~"10-49"~"10-49"~NULL~"business expansion"~"2012-04-03"
"Primavet-Sofia, Bulgaria"~"Primavet-Sofia Ltd."~"<p>Primavet-Sofia Ltd. specialises in the development, production and trade of pharmaceutical products and feed for animals, and also in cosmetic products for animals and humans. The main challenge experienced by the firm during the planning and implementation of restructuring was the long and complicated process of licensing new products – mostly veterinary drugs. On the whole, the restructuring process took place according to the management’s initial plans for the firm’s business development, and the planned outcomes were achieved.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Primavet-Sofia Ltd. was established in 1993. The company specialises in the development, production and trade of pharmaceutical products and feed for animals, and in also cosmetic products for animals and humans. More than 30 veterinary medicinal products and more than ten cosmetic and dental products for pets have been developed and put into production, as well as some supplementary and special feeds for animals, and cosmetics for humans containing bee products. </p>\r\n<p>The manufacture of veterinary medicinal products is a specialised process, based on high standards of quality, safety and efficacy of the products. The quality of the products is guaranteed by GMP and HACCP (GMP is a production and testing practice that helps to ensure a good quality product, while Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point is the systematic preventative approach to food safety, which addresses physical, chemical, and biological hazards as a means of prevention, rather than finished product inspection). </p>\r\n<p>The Quality Management System of the company is certified by ISO 9001–2000. During the 7th National Innovation Forum in 2011 in Bulgaria, the company was awarded the ‘Innovation Firm of 2010’ in the category of SMEs with up to 50 employees.</p>\r\n<p>The firm strives to provide its customers with good quality, reliable products. This objective is achieved through the use of good quality materials, experienced staff and modern technological equipment. </p>\r\n<p>The process of creation, registration and production of veterinary medicinal products is regulated by European and Bulgarian law as well as other regulations. This is also true of supplementary and special feeds, biocides and cosmetics. </p>\r\n<p>The company’s experts, in cooperation with research workers from scientific centres, develop new products and perform laboratory and clinical tests.</p>\r\n<p>Primavet-Sofia Ltd. is particularly active in beekeeping societies and addresses the problems of the beekeepers, trying to help preserve the health of their bee colonies not only by the production and sale of effective medicines, but also by their presence on various forums with specialists from the firm giving lectures, seminars and presentations. </p>\r\n<p>The company edits the newsletter <i>Zdrava pchela</i> (Healthy bee), which specialises in bee health care. </p>\r\n<p>The company can be considered international, because in 2011 60% of its production was exported into 18 countries.</p>\r\n<p>The company’s highly-qualified team works in a 1,200 square metre modern production site. There are 45 full-time employees (80% are women, 50% have a university education and the average age is 40). The firm is owned by two people, who have equal shares. The manager has a degree in economics, but had no previous experience with restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>The business performance of the company since 2005 can be summarised as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2005–2007, low profit because the main investments\r\nwere in the process;</li>\r\n<li>2008–2009, an increase in sales and\r\nprofit;</li>\r\n<li>2010–2011, a steady increase in sales and profit by\r\naround 30%.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are no works councils or trade union branches in the firm.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>There were three main factors that led to the restructuring process:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>signs of the forthcoming economic crisis;</li>\r\n<li>the desire to expand the company’s\r\nactivities;</li>\r\n<li>the belief that only through constant restructuring could\r\nthe firm innovate in different areas. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The company’s approach to restructuring was very cautious and was organised step by step, because of some difficulties with finance. First, it built its production premises and then it bought the equipment, again gradually, one machine after the other. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring constituted a <i>business expansion</i> as well as an <i>internal restructuring</i>.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring included the following stages: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>development of cooperation with research and development\r\ninstitutions;</li>\r\n<li>development of innovation activities in all areas, and\r\nparticularly the production of new products;</li>\r\n<li>preparations for entering a new foreign market, including\r\nadaptation of management strategy and company structure;</li>\r\n<li>increase in exports (with 100% in 2011 and with 50% in\r\n2010).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Priority was given to the innovations, because the company has a good track record in this area, in particular:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>much experience in the field of innovations;</li>\r\n<li>a number of innovators in the firm; </li>\r\n<li>close cooperation with innovators in different institutes\r\nand universities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The restructuring began in 2007 and is ongoing. It is a combination of: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>introduction of new products (veterinary drugs and\r\nproducts);</li>\r\n<li>changes in management (in accordance with the changes of\r\nthe firm buildings);</li>\r\n<li>changes to company structure (organisational\r\nadjustments);</li>\r\n<li>exports (finding new non-EU partners). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The whole process of generating and implementing ideas for changes, with the increase in contacts with Bulgarian and foreign partners, and greater participation in national and international conferences was implemented by the managers and the owners of the firm.</p>\r\n<p>An important factor for restructuring was the company premises. Up to 2001 they had rented premises. After 2001 the firm built its new plant, and after 2004 started buying the necessary equipment step by step. This action made the company more independent, led to organisational changes in its structure and increased its production. All of these resulted in an increase in profits. The manager and the two owners were involved in the decision to restructure the firm. They had clear ideas about restructuring for several years but there was no written restructuring plan, although this was a part of its investment programme. The necessary adjustments were made during the implementation of their ideas for restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>The whole process of restructuring was funded by firm’s own financial resources. For example, in 2005–2007 almost all profit was directed toward investments in restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>The workers were informed about the restructuring process and most of them showed high commitment during the whole restructuring period. They well understood the need for modernisation during a time of crisis. To some extent, the crisis triggered the restructuring, but the process was also a part of the continuous efforts of the owners and management to improve the work of the firm. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenge experienced by the firm during the planning and implementation of restructuring was the long and complicated process of licensing new products – mostly veterinary drugs – as well as licensing products for selling in other countries (which can take at least two to three years). These long delays have a negative impact on the whole firm’s activity, especially in the field of exports, because it prevents the firm from being able to service the requests of international partners.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The firm managed to carry out the restructuring without any advice or support. They relied entirely on their and their business partners’ (suppliers and customers) professional resources. This required a good understanding of the temporary constraints and breach of contractual obligations, business advice and counselling. Access to bank loans was very difficult, so the company decided to apply for finance from European funds. </p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately their proposal for the project for the Operational Programme ‘Competitiveness’ was rejected on the grounds of what they consider to be ‘formal reasons’. Therefore the firm had to develop new products by using their own funds. Management feel the Bulgarian administration is still not prepared to support and help Bulgarian business, especially during a crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>On the whole, the restructuring process took place according to the management’s initial plans for the firm’s business development, and the planned outcomes were achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Employees were encouraged, through a series of meetings,\r\nto participate in the restructuring plans. These led to better understanding of\r\nthe process of restructuring and active participation in it.</li>\r\n<li>The number of employees increased from 25 to 45 because\r\nof the business development of the firm. All newly recruited employees had the\r\nrequired professional training, selected according to the firm’s standard\r\nprocedures.</li>\r\n<li>The working conditions improved (most of the staff are\r\nworking in the new building with improved health and safety conditions, and new,\r\nmodern equipment was introduced).</li>\r\n<li>Due to the improvement of the production process,\r\nintroduction of new technologies and the new organisational structure, the\r\nquality of the production was improved and the range of the vet products was\r\nexpanded.</li>\r\n<li>Exports  increased.</li>\r\n<li>Employees’ salaries increased and are now above the\r\nBulgarian average.</li>\r\n<li>The introduction of the new organisational structure\r\nproved to be successful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The general reaction of the employees was very positive. This opinion of the management was confirmed by an interview with one staff member of the commercial department. She considers that the changes made in the firm during the last ten years have benefited both employees and the business of the company. The changes were especially successful in finding new foreign markets, which resulted in better economic results for the company during the last few years. That was reflected by an increase of wages for staff.</p>\r\n<p>Primavet-Sofia Ltd. plans to continue to focus on innovation and better business performance.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The major success factors of the restructuring process were identified as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a pro-active and strategic approach;</li>\r\n<li>close personal engagement and initiative by the manager\r\nand owners;</li>\r\n<li>economic and commercial expertise; </li>\r\n<li>development of a sense of taking responsibility by the\r\nmanagement and the majority of staff;</li>\r\n<li>timely implementation of tasks;</li>\r\n<li>concentration on the core competences of the\r\nfirm;</li>\r\n<li>organising a more active form of sales;</li>\r\n<li>an honest attitude towards employees;</li>\r\n<li>the willingness of most employees to adapt to the speed\r\nof the changes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Management also feels that their staff understands that an increase in wages and the hiring of extra staff during a crisis is a sign of a good management. However, management would like to see an improvement in the bureaucracy of state administration, which they think is a prerequisite for better business performance. Management also feels that constant restructuring is the key to success in the 21st century – overcoming the status quo is a permanent job.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Elena Krastenova and Vladimir Pavlov, Foundation for Entrepreneurship Development</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>Nadezhda Pancheva, Manager Primavet-Sofia Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>One of the employees at Primavet-Sofia Ltd.</p>\r\n<p><b>Company address</b></p>\r\n<p>Primavet-Sofia Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>211A Slivnitsa Blvd.Sofia</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.primavet.com"">www.primavet.com</a> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Bulgaria"~"21 - manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"globalisation*recession/crisis"~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2012-04-12"
"Royal Tsatsoulis Bros, Greece"~"Royal Tsatsoulis Bros"~"<p>The case of Greek food processing company RTB highlights a successful SME restructuring event where family control and entrepreneurial skills played a major role. The owners–managers were free to plan and execute their ideas, and also to adapt the restructuring process at all stages, leading ultimately to a growth in turnover and satisfactory profitability. There was also very direct and efficient communication with employees during the process.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Royal Tsatsoulis Bros (RTB) is located in the industrial area of Xanthi in north-eastern Greece, and has a strong international presence. The company business is the food and beverages sector, particularly the processing of fresh vegetables, such as peppers, olives, tomatoes and pickled vegetables.</p>\r\n<p>RTB is a family-owned business founded in 1925 by the current owners’ grandfather in Kavala (35 km from its current location). The two owners succeeded their father as owners and managers. The company started by selling pickles in large volumes for the Greek market and has now expanded into new markets and products. In 1967 RTB initiated exporting to Germany, taking advantage of the strong presence of Greek immigrants there. The company’s first foray into exporting had been in 1936 by the current owners’ grandfather who reached an agreement to export pickled vegetables stored in wooden barrels to England. It was not until 1986 that the company decided to start packaging its products in jars under the company’s label.</p>\r\n<p>This decision was further fostered by the company’s relocation to Xanthi in 1998, where two main advantages were evident: first, the opportunity to use a biological system of cleaning of waste water and, second, the opportunity to expand the processing system by importing new technology (machines) that would allow the company to offer new products in labelled jars and other packages. Following relocation, RTB was able to take make economies of scale and promote products to large retailers, such as supermarkets. The company was soon able to enter additional foreign markets, such as Saudi Arabia, while continuously expanding its production process and its variety of products (such as vegetables stuffed with cheese and other delicatessen items). Nowadays, the company exports to 28 different countries, ranging from America to the Ukraine, Finland and Africa. Exports represent almost 80% of annual sales. The company sells to all major supermarkets, and can offer customers own-brand labelling, thus very often producing customised products in terms of the product and packaging. </p>\r\n<p>One of the company’s current owners, who has also been the general manager since 1995, studied at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and holds a graduate degree in Agricultural Engineering, and a master’s degree in Food Technology and Control. He has worked in the company from an early age and is aware of the different procedures and tasks performed in all departments of RTB. Nowadays, he is mainly responsible for the management, while he is also engaged in the research and development Department and quality control. His brother is in charge of the production department.</p>\r\n<p>RTB’s annual turnover exceeded €13 million in 2011, illustrating a stable growth pattern over the past few years. There are 75 people employed throughout the year in the Greek company, with 50 more employed on a seasonal basis, during the harvest period. Owing to the family nature of the business, the personnel have remained stable throughout the company’s history. There is no collective representation of employees or a works council.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Back in 2003, the company owners decided to expand sales in order to respond to the growing demand for pickled vegetables and similar products, mainly from abroad. However, there seemed to be a major barrier, related to the low volume of fresh vegetable production in Greece. As a result, RTB was unable to produce the needed volume in order to cover the growing demand. At first, a solution was reached by importing additional vegetables from neighbouring countries, such as Bulgaria, Macedonia and Turkey. At the same time, though, the owners faced another major problem, with pricing agreements, since there was a strong fluctuation in the volumes the major suppliers could offer, which in turn affected price levels and, ultimately, the company’s ability to negotiate with foreign customers. Specifically, as mentioned in our interview, suppliers are not always capable of meeting the contract specifications, as far as order volumes are concerned. This affects the company’s ability to negotiate with foreign customers, given that price is usually associated with discounts for large orders.</p>\r\n<p>The volume of fresh vegetables produced in the local market (northern Greece) is not enough to cover the demand of the company alone, which exceeds 5,000 tonnes per year. Moreover, the company faced enormous difficulties in order to ensure that contract terms with the farmers would be met, given that both the volumes produced and the agreed prices were not always fixed. Generally, according to the general manager, the farmers would offer part of their production to other firms, where higher prices are offered, despite the fact that a signed contract exists between them and RTB. Thus, even though several agreements were evident, they could not ensure access to raw materials, fresh vegetables, and as a result the company faced a limited capacity problem, given the large orders, especially from abroad.</p>\r\n<p>Access to fresh vegetables constituted the major barrier to growth, with plant capacity and price competitiveness second and third. The owners considered alternatives to overcome this situation. At first, they considered investing in a new plant in Bulgaria, given that many Greek firms had moved or expanded their activities there and, thus, an intensive foreign direct investment activity was observed, especially in northern Bulgaria. However, they soon realised that production of fresh vegetables in the Bulgarian market was even lower than in Greece, while costs per unit would not be significantly lower. Another alternative, the expansion of the production process to India, was assessed. However, this solution was soon rejected as well, given that, although labour costs would be significantly lower, distance and language could hinder RTB’s growth.</p>\r\n<p>Then the owners realised the potential of the market in Turkey, which presented some crucial advantages. First, the volume of fresh vegetable production is one of the highest in Europe: the country produces more than 130,000 tonnes of Florina peppers annually. Added to that, the quality of fresh vegetables is exceptionally high, owing to the climate and the environmental conditions in Turkey. Moreover, significant reductions in unit costs could be achieved, primarily due to differences in labour costs. In addition, the business environment in Turkey appeared to be another motivating factor, since there are important benefits for direct investments there (for example, export subsidies, and the financing of mechanical equipment upgrades) and a supportive legal and financial framework for exporting companies. The new plant in Turkey enabled access to an extensive labour pool and raw materials and the owners decided to proceed with this alternative, while maintaining the company’s operation in Greece, given the growing demand from large trading companies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was planned during 2003, while the construction of a new plant took place in the Çanakkale Province, on the southern (Asian) coast of the Dardanelles in Turkey during 2004. The new company (Royal Foods AS) started operations in 2005, and the plant reached full capacity two years later, following extensions to the building. The owners contributed 95% of the new company’s capital, while the remaining 5% is owned by a Turkish partner, who is employed as the general manager. However, the ownership and the management structure are centralised, given that the Greek owners are in essence entirely responsible for all activities that take place there.</p>\r\n<p>This process was mainly planned and executed by the current owners and their father in 2003. However, given that a new company was to be established, the three men thought that it would be in their best interests to cooperate with a partner they had in Turkey through their previous exporting activities. This man was mainly responsible for assisting in the location selection and negotiating with the Turkish authorities and the construction company, in order to act as an intermediary for the Greek entrepreneurs. As our interlocutor mentioned, apart from being the general manager of the new company, they decided to offer him the opportunity to contribute to the company’s capital, to obtain a higher level of commitment. Thus, an agreement was reached and the Turkish partner was also engaged in the planning process and the administrative issues that arose (for example, hiring new personnel).</p>\r\n<p>There are 35 persons permanently employed in the Turkish company, while 300 more are employed on a seasonal basis, during harvest time. The Turkish partner is mainly responsible for recruitment, although the existence of ‘local brokers’ is also evident. Labour costs include not only employee wages, but, in certain cases, also their transfer from their areas of residence, as well as food provided during breaks.</p>\r\n<p>During the early stages of restructuring, a general plan was set out by the Greek owners, even though, according to the general manager, it was not easy to define all related terms and milestones, or to specify a strict timetable, given the ‘greenfield’ character of the investment. Hence, the event could be characterised as a type of ‘informal implementation’, which lasted more than three years. As a result, personal monitoring of the process was essential, especially during the first year, which involved commuting on a weekly basis (four hours’ distance) for the owners and two or three other persons, mainly technical staff. The owners were fully responsible for restructuring, and no formal efforts were made to inform the Greek workforce since, given the family nature of the business, most were already aware of the owners’ intentions to expand operations and the production process in another country. Specifically, as mentioned before, the company has a large experience of exporting and cooperation with foreign customers (wholesalers and retailers). These activities had enhanced the workforce's ability to cooperate on an international level and, thus, it was obvious for most of them that the neighbouring markets presented specific advantages. As a result, the owners' decision to expand their production process in Turkey appeared as a rational solution to most employees, who realised this shift would assist the company to overcome the limitations that the Greek market presented.</p>\r\n<p>The major problems that occurred during planning and implementation related to RTB’s ability to ‘stick to the plan’. This refers to the owners’ skills and experience regarding restructuring, since it was the first time the company had undertaken such a radical change. However, they were able to handle the situation due to its ‘informal’ character, which enabled modifications to the plan or, in other words, owing to the greater flexibility a small company can enjoy regarding restructuring. At the same time, close monitoring of the restructuring event was essential at all stages, which was ensured by the weekly commute , given the relatively short distance between the company’s headquarters in Greece and the new plant in Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The most important challenge the managers faced was to familiarise themselves with a different legal framework and entrepreneurial mentality. However, this barrier proved to be of minor importance, given the experience gained through international collaborations in the past, involving the exporting operations the company had been engaged in for a long time. Another major challenge concerned the long-standing political and religious disputes between Greece and Turkey. It is worth mentioning here, however, that the company owners and their employees presented a greater sense of realism and proved to be more open-minded than the majority of the politicians on this issue. There was no significant reaction by employees or customers, and no major implications for them, as long as production on the Greek side of the border continued. Moreover, the owners did not seek to take advantage of any possible assistance from the Greek State, in order to avoid criticism of the local society. It is useful to note here that a sizeable percentage of the Turkish minority in Greece resides in the Prefecture of Xanthi, where the company is located. As the sales manager reported, an effective communication link between the company and customers was set up through the company's website, e-mail and telephone, which proved to be of crucial importance providing the necessary details on this move. The main argument was that the company would not discontinue its production in Greece, while the same quality control would be maintained for production in Turkey.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, allowing the Turkish manager to take a financial share in the new company assisted the Greek owners’ efforts to become familiar with the legal framework in Turkey. The Greek owners’ visits to the plant very often enhanced implementation of this process. Moreover, the Turkish partner, in addition to a translator employed to participate in the meetings, helped the owners to overcome the linguistic and communication problems that arose and ensured that this constraint would not constitute a threat towards successful implementation of restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>Finance for investment was another constraint. It was not an easy task to define the size of the plant and acquire the necessary funds. However, the owners decided to rely on their private funds, while a relatively small share of the investment was funded through bank loans, given the dearth of any other financial support mechanism, as will be discussed later. Moreover, the owners soon realised that they had to reconsider the size of the new plant, given that the market in Turkey presented some peculiarities. Significantly higher production volumes could be achieved there, given easier access to raw materials, while exporting subsidies from the State were also available. Thus, an alteration was decided regarding the size of the investment, which could allow the company to enjoy higher economies of scale and annual turnover. This was achieved through building extensions to the new plant, which lengthened the restructuring event but presented significant advantages for RTB’s growth.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The owner of RTB pointed to the dearth of public support instruments regarding SME restructuring in Greece. As a result, the company did not participate in any related programme, while the owners decided to rely solely on their own strengths in order to expand the company’s production process abroad. The same is true regarding assistance from the private sector, since the company did not receive any type of assistance, apart from bank financial support.</p>\r\n<p>However, the company owner holds a negative view of public actors engaged in consulting services or financial support mechanisms, even though he happens to be president of the local chamber of commerce and industry. He believes the Greek state presents a rather centralised and bureaucratic administrative system, which does not allow companies, especially small ones, to take advantage of assistance. Hence, he did not look for any public support during restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>During the planning process, and before the owners decided to establish the plant in Turkey, the owners discussed their plans with a friend, also an entrepreneur, who had relocated to Bulgaria. This fact indicates the procedures undertaken at the small firm level in Greece, as regards, this type of restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>RTB’s owners soon realised that a more favourable business environment was evident in Turkey, especially for companies exporting high value-added products from Turkey. The company faced no significant bureaucratic barriers or problems related to the legal framework. They were also able to take advantage of specific measures (such as export subsidies or financial assistance for machinery upgrades) in Turkey, which proved to be of crucial importance for the company’s smooth operation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The outcomes of restructuring are considered to be positive so far, according to both the owners and the sales manager, given that there has been no reduction in the number of employees in the Greek company. Business expansion to Turkey enabled higher production volumes with lower per unit costs, and ensured the survival of the ‘parent’ firm in Greece, since a significant part of the raw materials acquired through the Turkish market are further processed in the Greek plant. At the same time, RTB gained easier access to the significantly larger neighbouring market, while its exporting activities were further strengthened by higher production volumes that can meet international demand at competitive prices. Thus, the primary goals of this restructuring effort have been met.</p>\r\n<p>The company has been able to overcome barriers by taking advantage of the flexibility common to smaller firms. This, combined with the short distance between the company’s headquarters in Greece and the production unit in Turkey, enabled close monitoring of the whole process, while maintaining overall control and the ability to find suitable solutions to emerging problems.</p>\r\n<p>Even though the general manager does not believe that all goals have been completely met, he considers restructuring, assessed in a 'pragmatic' manner, to have been a reasonable success. Moreover, the owners did not face additional pressures from external shareholders or a trade union, which is more generally the case in larger enterprises. This is considered to be another critical success factor, which enabled alteration of the restructuring plan without further problems, as the extension of the production unit at a later stage of the restructuring process demonstrates.</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, even though restructuring generated additional workload pressures for managerial staff, these were faced primarily as a challenge and not as a negative aspect of the whole process. Moreover, the family nature of the business ensured that no particular efforts were necessary to communicate the ‘message of change’ to other employees, who were able to appreciate business expansion as a means to ensure long-term company survival and growth.</p>\r\n<p>The company owners are convinced that they have taken the right decision at the right moment, since they would have been less able to execute this plan today, owing to the economic recession during 2011–2012. From a personal point of view, he realises that this ‘shift in the company’s history’ has created enormous benefits, such as a better understanding of production and trade on a global scale and improvement of his managerial skills.</p>\r\n<p>RTB has enjoyed a growing turnover and satisfactory profitability, which can ensure that the next generation will be left with a profitable business. According to the owners, this would not have been possible if they had not decided to expand their activities to Turkey, while maintaining a good part of production and sales activities in Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The case of RTB demonstrates a successful SME restructuring event. Given the family nature of the business and its size, this company constitutes a typical example of a Greek SME. Moreover, it confirms the dominance of a rather centralised governance structure in which the company owners appear to hold a preeminent role, evident during restructuring. Their skills, characteristics (for example, age, experience, educational level) and entrepreneurial mentality can define the success or failure of most Greek SMEs, as the case of RTB illustrates. </p>\r\n<p>Moreover, this case highlights the significance of flexibility in Greek SMEs. Given, for example, the absence of shareholders or collective employee representation, the owners–managers in these cases are more able to freely plan and execute their ideas, but also alter a restructuring process, even at later stages. Owners can also easily establish more direct and efficient communication links with employees compared with the case of large-scale enterprises, which can also foster successful implementation of a restructuring event.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, the findings confirm that the main motives for a Greek SME to expand in a foreign country are related to lower per unit costs and access to new markets, which constitute a means to ensure the survival of the firm and its future growth. Thus, restructuring events of this type represent one of the few alternatives for small firms to internationalise their activities and increase sales volumes. Hence, one could expect this phenomenon to increase during times of financial recession, such as the one Greece faces today.</p>\r\n<p>The list of critical success factors in the case of Greek SMEs’ expansion in foreign countries processes includes geographical proximity (which is particularly true for RTB given that is located in northern Greece), as close monitoring of the whole process seems to be essential, especially during the early phases, and can also ensure better communication and higher levels of trust. This argument was clearly confirmed by the case study presented above.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, it is worth mentioning that both the general manager and the sales manager feel they have been successful in ensuring a smooth transition in the company’s history, while most major goals were also met, concerning faster and cheaper access to raw materials. At the same time, access to new markets was also facilitated, given lower unit costs, which rendered export products more competitive in international markets. Thus, the company is nowadays able to face, in a more efficient way than many of its Greek competitors, the impacts of the current economic downturn.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Lois Labrianidis and Nikos Vogiatzis, University of Macedonia, Thessaloniki</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interviews</b></p>\r\n<p>One of the owners/general managers, Royal Tsatsoulis Bros</p>\r\n<p>Sales manager, Royal Tsatsoulis Bros</p>\r\n<p><b>Company address</b> Royal Tsatsoulis BrosXanthi Industrial Zone67100 Xanthi, Greece </p>\r\n<p><b>Company website</b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.royal.gr/"">http://www.royal.gr/</a> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Greece"~"10 - manufacture of food products"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"globalisation"~"business expansion"~"2012-02-24"
"Solar panel company, France"~"Solar panel company"~"<p>Changes in legislation led a French distributor and installer of photovoltaic solar panels to close regional offices and concentrate activities in one region. Some 10–15 staff were dismissed and others left voluntarily. The company has adopted a new business strategy, diversifying into other renewable-energy products to offset falling demand for photovoltaic products. It created 44 new call centre jobs in 2010, bringing staff numbers to 160 and has plans to expand into other regions once again and to hire many more staff.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The company is a French supplier of solar panels produced in Germany and Switzerland. It specialises in both the distribution and installation of solar panels and other energy-efficient products. The company was set up in the 2000s and gradually expanded to its current (spring 2011) 160 employees. </p>\r\n<p>By the end of 2010, the company had several regional sites across France. Following a change in the legislation on PV (photovoltaic) systems, the company decided to concentrate all activities in one region and close the other regional sites. All employees at the affected sites were offered relocation to other company sites. This restructuring plan resulted in the dismissal of between 10 and 15 employees; additional workers left the company on a voluntary basis. Mainly administrative staffs were affected, while sales and technical jobs were kept. At that time, the aim was to reduce administrative overheads/ costs. </p>\r\n<p>The company owner and managing director carried out technical and business administration studies and has considerable work experience in the sector, not only in France but also abroad. </p>\r\n<p>In terms of workforce composition, the average age of employees is 30–35 years. There are very few employees older than 50 years or younger than 30. On the whole, the company employs more women than men; however, it depends on the posts. There are more women working in the call centres (80% of the call centre staff are women) whereas only men are employed as skilled technicians and male employees tend to predominate in sales jobs. One company objective is to achieve a better gender balance in the workforce composition. </p>\r\n<p>There are four employee representatives within the company. Only the call centre staff are represented by the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (Confédération française démocratique du travail, CFDT). Administrative staff and technicians are not unionised, by their own choice. The managing director regularly informs his staff directly about relevant issues.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>The recent expansion of the business was partly facilitated by a favourable economic climate as the company is located in a region that has been less affected by the recent recession than other parts of France. There was no decline in orders during the crisis. Nevertheless, the impression is that nowadays the clients are somehow less receptive and more efforts are needed to achieve results compared to previous years. </p>\r\n<p>The company plans to expand in the region and eventually to reopen other sites across the country. In 2011 the company launched a new business strategy based on product diversification covering a wider range of renewable energy-related products (that is, heating systems, thermal insulation, etc.). This strategy is deemed necessary due to the fact that the PV (photovoltaic) products do not sell as they used to – this requires a reorganisation to adjust to a more diversified and changing market. </p>\r\n<p>As part of this strategy, the company envisages consolidating its position in France and expanding outside Europe. To this end, the company is now seeking to consolidate business relations with companies in North Africa and the United States. The long-term plan is to engage in production and cover the full chain from production to distribution and installation of energy-efficient products. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In late 2010, the company created 44 new jobs for a new call centre, bringing the workforce up to 160 employees. The company received some subsidies from a large multinational which, after dismissing a large number of workers, reached an agreement with the local authorities to launch a so-called ‘revitalisation’ plan involving economic incentives for new businesses willing to invest in the area. At the time of the interview, the company was also likely to receive some public subsidies. The recruitment of the 44 employees at the call centre was completed by spring 2011. In 2010 the company achieved a turnover of €15 million, an increase of 20%. Following these positive results, in early 2011 the company announced the creation of 60 new administrative and sales jobs. However, the shortage of skilled labour is a major problem in the recruitment process. There are still 30 sales positions to fill. The new diversification strategy launched in 2011 entails the creation of 40 new jobs by the end of 2011 and another 200 new jobs with the opening of new sites across the country by 2013–2014.</p>\r\n<p>The new strategy based on diversification was planned carefully before entering the implementation phase. This started with the analysis of the existing business process and workflow and subsequently the definition of a business plan. Different stages of the workflow were identified. The first stage involves the call centre employees who set the appointments with potential clients. In a second stage, these calls are followed up by the sales people who meet the clients to sell the products. The third stage consists of the administrative paperwork (opening and management of the client file) and the final stage is the installation of the panels and closure of the client file. The company monitors the share of successful contacts at each stage to ensure that the number of employees needed (in particular sales persons) are in place at later stages. </p>\r\n<p>No consulting companies have been involved in the process of setting out and implementing the new business strategy: this would require additional financial resources that are not available. Also, more importance is attached to the opinion and expertise of the staff who are involved in the day-to-day activities. Communication and consultation with the staff is a key element of the organisational culture within the company. All staff are informed about the changes that will occur, and they are all provided with opportunities to grow and develop in the company. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The most pressing issue is to find funding for the injection of funds to improve the cash flow. It is estimated that €2–3 million are necessary to grow and continue the business successfully. One of the problems is that the loan guarantees and credits provided by public authorities are too limited: an SME needs a bigger buffer of money to survive. </p>\r\n<p>The recent support measures for SMEs introduced by the French government target mainly innovative SMEs, and SMEs that produce and/or export. SMEs operating in the service sector are not covered by these support measures. The net should be thrown as wide as possible to cover a larger number and wider typology of SMEs. Instruments and measures provided through the French state-backed investment fund FSI (<i>Fonds stratégique d’investissement</i>) and OSEO (support agency for the development of French SMEs) for the injection of funds are not effective because the eligibility criteria are often too restrictive. </p>\r\n<p>To deal with this issue of lack of funds, the plan is to sell off a portion of the company to increase the shareholder equity/capital and have a bigger free floating cash reserve to prepare future investments. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company obtained some subsidies from a multinational company  for the creation of the call centre. They also received an OSEO loan guarantee for €250,000. The company also sought additional subsidies from the general local council but without success. </p>\r\n<p>The recent business expansion has been conducted without the support of any consultancy companies. There are not enough resources for this, so the company is obliged to do everything on its own. With regard to the diversification strategy, there is generally some reluctance to seek the support of consultancies and the company relies mainly on in-house expertise. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>There is a clear and explicit HR strategy which was introduced in 2011. The main element of this strategy is continuous vocational training for all employees. The company started with the employees responsible for sales and will then target employees in the call centres and administrative staff. Technicians receive training on a regular basis. All training is provided by (local) accredited training providers. Also, a quality control system has been put in place to ensure that the HR strategy is effective. </p>\r\n<p>Organisational adjustments are frequent in the company. However this continuous change is positive in many ways (that is, possibilities for promotion, salary increases, post upgrades, etc.). It is left up to each employee whether they want to progress in the company or continue with the same job. As a result of the business expansion, some employees have been promoted and posts upgraded. To cope with the rapid pace of change, continuous vocational training is part and parcel of the company’s HR strategy. The company’s responsibility is to ensure that all employees are provided with training opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>In spite of this approach, which is firmly oriented towards the enhancement of employee skill sets, there is a relatively high staff turnover within the company. Many sales staff have recently left the company because they felt that their skills were not in line with the new business strategy. Even in the context of business expansion, employees are generally concerned about the impact of the forthcoming changes on their job. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>As the company is not an innovative SME but rather driven by the need to respond to market demands, continuous change and adjustment of the business strategy is not an option but a must. This requires the company to be vigilant at all times, receptive and ready to adjust quickly. For example the company is certified ISO 9-2001; however, the company will have to apply for ISO certification again soon because the market changes continuously and there is a need to keep up to date in order to retain the business. </p>\r\n<p>The recent growth of the company partly results from the continuous efforts to meet client demands which at times may put extra pressure on some employees.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Sara Riso, Eurofound</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interview </b></p>\r\n<p>Owner and managing director </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"France"~"43 - specialised construction activities"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"business expansion"~"2011-04-27"
"Solic Group, France"~"Solic Group"~"<p>French recruitment group Solic grew steadily from taking on its first employee in 1996 until 2008. By then it had some 92 employees in eight locations. Its recruitment service was badly affected by the crisis that struck in 2008 as French companies froze recruitment and cancelled recruitment contracts. Over three rounds of restructuring in 2008–2009 Solic Group reduced staff numbers, closed branches and entered administration to save the business. It exited the observation period of the administration in early 2010 and now has 34 employees. </p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Solic Group was set up in Paris by Luc Doucerain in 1989 (without employees). Initially the group consisted of a consulting firm on IT engineering and a subsidiary specialising in recruitment. In June 1996, Luc Doucerain’s 20-year-old son, Nicolas Doucerain, bought the recruitment subsidiary and took over the business while his father continued to own and manage the other line of the business (that is, consulting on IT engineering). Luc Doucerain continued working as chief financial director within the group. </p>\r\n<p>Before working in the Solic Group, Nicolas Doucerain had worked for a Rover car dealer since he was 16 years old (starting as an apprentice). In 1994, he received an award for best salesperson in France. When he was 18 years old, he was promoted to commercial director of the company. Two years later he left the company to join his father’s business. </p>\r\n<p>After Nicolas Doucerain took over the family business, Solic Group grew steadily until 2008. In 1996, the first employee was recruited and by 2008 (prior to the restructuring) the company employed some 92 workers. Headquartered in Paris, Solic Group opened seven branches over the years (Lille in 1999, Lyon in 2000, Nantes in 2003, Besançon in 2005, Algiers in 2007, Geneva and Quimper in 2008). On the whole, about 60% of the staff were employed at the Paris headquarters and the remaining 40% in the other branches in France and abroad. In France, all employees were employed on indefinite contract. About 90% were professionals (<i>cadres</i>) and 10% were administrative staff. Among the professionals there were six shareholders (<i>cadres dirigeants</i>) who were also members of the managing committee (<i>comité de direction</i>). </p>\r\n<p>Female staff accounted for 70% of the company’s entire workforce – this is partly due to the nature of the business as well as the qualifications required (women are more likely to study and specialise in organisational psychology, an important qualification in human resources and recruitment). Prior to the restructuring, the age structure of the workforce was very mixed (with employees aged 26 to 63 years). The average age was approximately38 years. </p>\r\n<p>As the company grew in size, an HR strategy was put in place to ensure equality of treatment among the staff. This entailed the setting of well-defined objectives for each employee. The pay was partly determined by the objectives and consisted of a fixed basic wage and variable components. About 60% of the variable component was distributed among all employees and the remaining 40% was linked to individual performance. The new HR strategy also included investments in training related to the company’s business. </p>\r\n<p>The workforce was not unionised. There were four staff representative (of whom two were deputy staff representatives). Two were representing the professionals (‘cadres’) and the other two represented the administrative staff.  </p>\r\n<p>In 2007, Solic Group obtained a prestigious award for best performing and growing SME – the <i>Trophée des gazelles</i> – in recognition of its achievements. The<i> </i> initiative was launched in 2006 by the French government to award the 2000 best-performing SMEs which had generated double-digit growth and created jobs over the previous three years. The award-winning SMEs were then exempted from the payment of corporate tax and social contributions (for the staff hired in that year) for the duration of a year. </p>\r\n<p>In June 2008, French investment fund Audacia (chaired by Charles Beigbeder) entered the company’s capital by injecting some €1.5 million into the business. This injection of funds was driven by the wish to strengthen the capital base of the company and expand the business further. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>The business has been severely affected by the economic crisis which started on 15 September 2008 with the collapse of Lehman Brothers bank. At the outset of the crisis many French companies announced extensive and prolonged recruitment freezes. There had already been a slowdown in recruitment starting in spring 2008. On 30 September 2008, the company already had a deficit of €300,000. The effect of the global crisis was particularly felt by the company in November 2008 when many clients started to cancel or postpone their projected recruitment (for example, Invest Banking, Metalizer, Assuranciel). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In an attempt to avoid further distress among the staff due to the numerous cancellations of contracts, the management sought to improve the flow of information within the company and infuse optimism in the staff. Employees were encouraged to report regularly to the management on new contracts signed with clients and this information was widely circulated within the company. Those who felt that they had no work to perform were required to meet the management and discuss possible solutions. However, in spite of the efforts of the management, orders from clients continued to plummet. </p>\r\n<p>Overall, the company went through three consecutive waves of restructuring from the end of 2008 until mid-2009. Throughout the whole process the works council (<i>comité d’entreprise</i>) and staff representatives were informed and consulted but not directly involved in the decision-making.</p>\r\n<p>For all waves of restructuring, the selection of the posts to cut was made on the basis of the objective and pre-established criteria defined by law such as the length of service in the company, age, marital status, number of children, disability and level of education. The management informed the employee representatives about the decision to cut the posts during an extraordinary meeting. They did not oppose the plan as they realised that the company was in serious trouble and there were no other alternatives. They then informed the staff about the planned dismissals without disclosing the names of the redundant employees. All staff were shocked and very concerned about their jobs. The affected employees were sent redundancy notices by registered mail. In the meantime, the company director proposed individual meetings with all staff if they wished to meet him. In spite of the difficult circumstances, the employees showed understanding and did not challenge the decision. </p>\r\n<p>With regard to support offered to the redundant employees affected by the restructuring, various measures were taken. Employees were offered the possibility of benefiting from state-subsidised <a HREF=""http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/F11625.xhtml"">reclassification schemes</a> which entitled them to training, skills assessment and assistance to get back to employment. In addition, the management contacted various companies (including clients) in an effort to help the company’s redundant employees to find jobs, and succeeded in placing all of them. Two internal consultants were also tasked to provide affected employees with psychological support on an individual basis throughout the whole process. </p>\r\n<p>Due to the cancellation of many contracts with clients, the second semester of 2008 ended with a deficit of €1.2 million. In October 2008, managing director Nicolas Doucerain announced to his partners that he planned to dismiss nine employees, thus avoiding the red tape associated with the job preservation plan (<i>plan de sauvegarde de l’emploi</i>) which is required by French law only if the company (employing more than 50 people) intends to dismiss at least 10 employees on economic grounds. </p>\r\n<p>In an effort to reduce the costs, the company director reduced his salary by 40% and proposed a 20% wage cut for the management. Another cost-saving measure was to discontinue the use of company cars. Also overheads were reduced – for example, by closing a number of branches. In 2008, the company closed the branches in Geneva and Lyon and dismissed nine employees. </p>\r\n<p>In January 2009, many clients continued to cancel their recruitment plans and the losses for the company reached €113,000 – €50,000 more than expected. With the exception of the branch in Algiers, all remaining branches were severely affected by the crisis. By early February 2009, there was only €600,000 left as capital equity. In order to ensure the survival of the company, costs were further reduced with the suppression of bonuses and fringe benefits (for all employees), the closure of the branches in Besançon, Lille and Quimper and the dismissal of another nine employees. </p>\r\n<p>Although some contracts were signed with new clients, the company continued to struggle financially. Solic Group entered into administration and initiated the liquidation procedure in June 2009. At the same time the company put in place a job preservation plan (<i>plan de sauvegarde de l’emploi</i>) which envisaged the loss of 35 jobs. On the same day the company entered into administration, all major clients were informed and reassured that the company was still viable and would continue in business. The job preservation plan was approved by the managing committee (<i>comité de direction</i>) and the administrator appointed by the court.</p>\r\n<p>As soon as the company went into administration, a new bank account was opened in a specialised bank dealing with companies in administration. During the observation period (<i>periode d’observation</i>), the business had no credit and could not overdraw money. The company director did not receive any remuneration during the first four months of the observation period. </p>\r\n<p>The Commercial Court of Nanterre appointed an administrator who took co-charge of the management of the company during the observation period which lasted six months from 1 July until 31 December 2009. During this time, there were regular progress meetings with the Commercial Court. </p>\r\n<p>In September 2009 the economic situation improved and the deficit amounted to only €9,000. The business formally exited the observation period in early January 2010 when its continuation plan (<i>plan de continuation de redressement</i>) was approved by the Commercial Court. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Although the French government introduced a set of measures to help SMEs, including loans and guarantees channelled through OSEO (support agency for the development of SMEs), the bureaucratic procedures required to make use of such measures were regarded as time-consuming, the regulations extremely complicated and certain conditions to access funds difficult to fulfil (for companies struggling financially). Also, the funding was limited and not sufficient to solve the financial problems. The maximum amount for the loan guarantee was €400,000. At that time, the company needed a much higher buffer to survive the crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Even after the observation period, the company continued to have difficulty in obtaining bank loans. Banks are reluctant to give loans to a company that has just exited the observation period. The main challenge is to achieve a positive cash flow and a certain level of profitability to be able to cover running costs and continue developing the business.  </p>\r\n<p>As a more general consideration, in the context of a globalised economy, many businesses are faced with increased uncertainty. This makes it difficult to anticipate and avoid the negative consequences of major restructuring. This was and continues to be a challenge for Solic Group, as for many other companies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>As indicated above, the company explored the possibility of obtaining a loan from OSEO. However, certain conditions to obtain a loan could not be fulfilled by the company. For example, when applying for an OSEO loan, the company is required to declare that it would not enter into administration in the next six to twelve months. Another condition to obtain a loan from OSEO is that a bank contributes 30% of the loan. As the company was struggling financially, neither condition could be fulfilled. </p>\r\n<p>In March 2009, the company applied for short-time working (<a HREF=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef10633.htm"">chomage partiel)</a>, which was then authorised and lasted from April 2009 until the end of August 2009. All employees were affected by this measure (depending on the post, the reduction of working time was between one and two days per week). However, this was a temporary measure and did not help to avoid the third wave of restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>In terms of private business support to the restructuring, the company was supported by a tax consultant during the whole restructuring process. He had been working for the company since it was established. The company also turned to an expert specialised in insolvency procedures three months before entering into administration (from March until June 2009). He trained and prepared the management to deal with the insolvency. He also provided his expertise throughout the observation period until the approval of the continuation plan (<i>plan de continuation de redressement</i>). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>first and second waves of restructuring which led to the\r\nloss of 18 jobs, wage reductions, suppression of bonuses and fringe benefits\r\nwere not successful as the business continued to struggle with its finances in a\r\ntroubled economic climate. The third wave of restructuring entailed the\r\nliquidation procedure and an extensive social plan affecting 35 employees. Of\r\nthe six shareholding employees, one retired during the restructuring process and\r\nanother four left the company. Solic has currently 34 employees.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>During the observation period, the management and the staff made efforts to remain in business and prepared a detailed continuation plan that could convince the judge that the company was still viable. The continuation plan will end in 2020. The company’s deficit diminished and the continuation plan was approved by the Commercial Court at the end of the six-month period. This is a positive result considering that the observation period is often renewed for another six months and many French businesses do not even survive to the liquidation procedure. All clients were pleased to learn about the positive outcome of the restructuring and showed solidarity with the firm. Some of them offered to pay their invoices before the due date.  </p>\r\n<p>Immediately after the restructuring, seven or eight former employees were recruited on temporary contract as business started to improve steadily. Since then, the company has acquired new clients and reopened its branch in Lille in June 2011.</p>\r\n<p>The company came out of its difficulties mainly thanks to the relentless efforts and determination of its employees and the management, who showed commitment to the organisation through the restructuring process. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>In the case of Solic Group, the determination of the company director as well as the support and dedication of the employees was key to the success of the restructuring process. </p>\r\n<p>One of the main difficulties encountered by the company concerns the lack of flexibility of French labour law and the fact that redundancy procedures are time-consuming, bureaucratic and expensive for employers (especially for SMEs). This prevents companies that are already struggling financially from acting fast and efficiently. It was highlighted by the company managing director that although the ultimate objective is to protect employees, the result is the opposite. </p>\r\n<p>The other difficulty that Solic Group, like many other French SMEs, is generally confronted with is the limited access to funding and insufficient accompanying measures to help them to grow and compete in an increasingly globalised economy. As a result there are many very small businesses (TPEs – <i>très petites entreprises</i>) and small businesses in France and very few medium-sized enterprises. </p>\r\n<p>The importance of anticipation was particularly highlighted. In particular, business owners and managers are not familiar with liquidation procedures and the assistance of a legal expert is necessary to comply with the procedures and exit the observation period successfully.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Sara Riso, Eurofound</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p><b>Interview</b></p>\r\n<p>Nicolas Doucerain, Managing Director, Solic Group</p>\r\n<p>Nicolas Doucerain (2011),<i> Ma petite entreprise a connu la crise, </i> Editeur François Bourin. </p>\r\n<p><b>Company address</b></p>\r\n<p>Solic Group</p>\r\n<p>6 allée Gustave Eiffel 92130 Issy-Les-Moulineaux France</p>\r\n<p><b>Company website </b></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.solic-group.com/index.php/fre"">http://www.solic-group.com/index.php/fre</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"France"~"78 - employment activities"~"50-249"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"(avoiding) bankruptcy"~"2012-05-29"
"Eesti Finantsteenuste Agentuur, Estonia"~"Eesti Finantsteenuste Agentuur OÜ"~"<p>This restructuring case involves the merger of two small financial services companies: one lacked skilled labour but had extra office space; the other had a surplus of staff and hence needed extra space. A merger was seen as a quicker, more cost-effective way to grow than recruitment of new staff, saving time and resources on training and bringing the new person up to full capacity. The larger company brings greater specialisation and hence more opportunities for development. The management feels that their biggest mistake was not to publicise the merger more effectively, hence missing out on potential business opportunities.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>On 5 January, 2011 Eesti Finantsteenuste Agentuur (EFTA) was founded, a result of the merger of two companies: Assets RMP OÜ and ADEX Financial Solutions OÜ. Both the former companies as well as the newly formed company provide financial services (accounting, financial advising, and legal advice). The company has about 26 employees and is managed by three owner/managers: Ellen Tohvri, Kaire Lukkanen-Jaas and Mirje Trumsi. Most of the employees are young women (about 25–35 years old) with higher education. There is no trade union or works council in the company. The company has offices both in Tallinn and in Tartu, the second largest town in Estonia.</p>\r\n<p>Assets RMP was founded by Ellen Tohvri in 1991 (the same year Estonia regained its independence). Ms Tohvri graduated from the University of Tartu in the field of economics. Over the 20 years, Ms Tohvri has from time to time worked for other companies as financial manager and CEO, but she has still always worked for Assets. These experiences helped her collect knowledge and skills she could not have obtained otherwise. Still, she had no former merger experience. Since 2006 she has been working full time in Assets again. In 2010, Assets had 15 employees.</p>\r\n<p>Adex was founded by Kaire Lukkanen-Jaas and Mirje Trumsi in 1999. Both owner-managers studied law at the University of Tartu and economics at Tallinn University of Technology. They started their own business soon after graduation. Compared to Assets, Adex was smaller in terms of manpower (11 employees in 2008; six employees in 2010) but was developing very quickly in the field of e-accounting. The financial indicators of the two companies did not differ greatly.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>Business Register data shows that in 2008 1,842 companies provided accountancy services in Estonia and total turnover of the market was € 56.3 million. The market is very fragmented and even more self-employed accountants emerged during the economic recession because of the very high unemployment rate.</p>\r\n<p>Neither Assets nor Adex had to struggle for existence but they still faced several challenges. Ms Tohvri felt that she did not have the time and energy to cope alone with all the main activities of the company – sales and marketing, internal processes and IT. Internal processes were well developed in Assets – for example it was ISO 9001 certified – however, in the area of IT the company had some gaps. In addition, Assets had lost some of its clients, not to competitors, but because they ceased to exist. In this situation, Assets had excessive resources in terms of qualified accountants. At the same time, Adex lacked employees.</p>\r\n<p>The managers of the two companies met while preparing the foundation of the Association of Estonian Accounting Firms (ERPEL) in 2010. They soon found several opportunities for cooperation. As mentioned previously, Adex was lacking skilled labour and Assets had more resources than needed at that moment. Also, Assets had to find new space for its office in Tallinn and Adex had some extra space.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, Assets was eager to develop in the field of e-accounting, but unfortunately their software did not support its endeavours. They used the international programme Hansa which they found expensive to continuously upgrade and new solutions a little slow to emerge. Adex was more advanced in this respect, using paperless accounting systems and the internet-based programme Directo. E-accounting is gaining more and more popularity in Estonia, partly because of very bold steps taken by the Government. The Estonian programme Directo uses the most up-to-date technology and is able to respond to client’s additional needs quickly enough. In addition, it enables 24-hour access to the data independent of the location and is not too expensive (it is leased by clients).</p>\r\n<p>One of Assets’ key resources was the well-known Ms Tohvri, with her extensive social network and useful contacts, which were attractive to Adex.</p>\r\n<p>As the cooperation ideas grew, the owners of Assets and Adex understood that both companies had different strengths and weaknesses and together they could add value to each other. Consequently, the cooperation plans grew into the idea of a merger. To be precise, Ms Tohvri had already thought of a merger earlier, but had not started to look for a partner yet. In her opinion, a merger is a less costly and quicker way to grow than growing step-by-step on your own. The reason lies in the fact that after hiring a new employee it takes time before he or she becomes efficient. Usually the existing clients do not provide full-time work for a new accountant, so they need to find ways to sell their services for the remaining time. All in all, it usually takes a year before the new employee becomes fully trained to do their job efficiently. Therefore, Ms Tohvri felt that a merger would be a wiser choice especially considering the fact that she felt she also needed competent help at managerial level. So she was to a certain extent prepared for the merger, at least, psychologically, and had no specific fears, although she admits that integration always involves risks if you have single-handedly led the company for a long time.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the decision to merge the two companies was made in August–September 2010. From Assets’ side, the decision was made solely by Ms Tohvri. In her opinion, employees usually have more fears and if they were involved in the decision-making process there would have been a serious risk that the process might be delayed too much and probably not end with an agreement at all.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>No written plan was laid down during the preparations for restructuring besides the most important dates. The process itself was very quick – the decision was made in August–September 2010, in November 2010 Assets’ Tallinn office was moved to Adex’s office and on 5 January 2011 a new company was established. The need to move out from Assets’ Tallinn office sped up the process a little – it was not feasible to move to a temporary office for a short while in-between.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Tohvri believes that integration could have been quicker if they had planned the restructuring event in more detail. At the same time, they would not have been able to foresee all the risks. Also, the process was so quick that a formal plan would have been obstructive. In reality, the process was managed intuitively. Development manager Ave Sepik agrees that if they had had a more determined schedule and mid-term deadlines for specific steps of internal integration the process could have been faster. In reality some of the external deadlines, such as introduction of the euro, pushed the process.</p>\r\n<p>Employees were informed when the decision was made in September 2010. At the end of October, all personnel from the two companies gathered in a location outside the town for the whole day to get acquainted and plan the future. Ms Tohvri admits that the management could have involved employees more in the preparations, as although it shared information the employees felt it was not enough. Ms Sepik agrees with this, but at the same time admits that in Assets the management board level, who could have been the partner to the owners, was missing. Therefore it made sense that employees were more actively engaged in specific issues concerning their everyday work.</p>\r\n<p>Preparations included the decision about the future name of the company. Still, it was not the object of hard discussions as all owners agreed that the company needed a new name as they wanted the merger to be made on an equal basis. If one of the existing names had been chosen, it could have been interpreted as one of the companies swallowing the other.</p>\r\n<p>The introduction of the new organisational structure was one of the most important steps in the process. Assets was formally managed solely by Ms Tohvri from Tartu where the head office was located. Every day work of the Tallinn office was managed by its own manager. According to the new structure, EFTA is led by three equal executives, each of which is responsible for a specific area. The division of labour was decided at the early stages of negotiations based on previous competences and specific strengths and weaknesses of each owner–manager. The decision was made quite quickly without protracted negotiations.  </p>\r\n<p>Although the company has two offices, one in Tallinn and the other in Tartu, it no longer has separate managers. For example, Ms Trumsi works in Tallinn and leads the internal processes both in the Tallinn and Tartu offices. Ms Tohvri works in Tartu but is responsible for sales and marketing for the whole company.</p>\r\n<p>Changes in management were accompanied by changes in work methods. Now the whole company offers e-accountancy services and uses digital information systems. For this reason, employees of the former Assets were trained to use Directo by the providers of the programme. In addition, manuals were written on how to use eArvekeskus (e-Invoicing Center) which enables enterprises to exchange invoices electronically and also to process and store them electronically.</p>\r\n<p>As everyday work is internet-based and paperless, the actual location of an accountant does not matter anymore. New clients are given to the employee with the least workload, irrespective of the location.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The changes in work methods quite heavily influenced the everyday work of all the employees. Due to the introduction of e-invoices, there was no need to input the information from paper invoices anymore. Employees who used to do this kind of work had a challenge to cope with more demanding work assignments. No special training was offered for this reason but they could use guidance from coworkers and management. The process ended with the firing two employees who were not able or willing to take the step forward. They were replaced by two new accountants. Also, the secretary of one of the former companies was laid off because one secretary could satisfy the needs of the new company.</p>\r\n<p>A couple of employees did not settle into the new situation and left the company a while after the merger. They were not replaced one-on-one by new employees. Thanks to e-accountancy, a lot of the accountants’ time was saved which allowed them to undertake more work and clients. In this way, higher productivity growth was achieved.</p>\r\n<p>At first, employees were naturally confused by the whole process. Also, the managers had to get used to the new division of labour. Now and then orders given by managers were contradictory as they had not consulted each other. The situation was more complicated because one of the owner-managers left for maternity leave at the end of 2010, just at the time of the merger, returning in September 2011 after the merger was completed. Therefore, employees saw the situation changing twice. At first they operated temporarily with two active owner–managers who tried to fill in for the third owner–manager. After the maternity leave the responsibility areas were divided again among owner–managers and the former Assets employees had to get used to a new manager again.</p>\r\n<p>One aspect which nobody could foresee was the fact that in some ways it was not a merger of two but rather three companies. Assets had two offices with (to a certain extent) different cultures and habits. In reality, employees of the Tallinn office adjusted to the new company and its managers quicker as they worked at the same office with two new (Adex) managers. Adjustment of the employees in the Tartu office took a longer time, partly because they were used to working in the head office of a company. Only by September 2011 had the employees noticed that in everyday work they no longer called each other ‘we’ and ’you’ but rather only ‘we’.</p>\r\n<p>The most serious mistake made was related to notifying the wider public of the merger, according to Ms Tohvri. All the partners were too occupied with their everyday work and did not plan the presentation of the new company seriously enough. Only a new homepage was created which has been in a temporary state for over a year. They published the news on their homepages but it was not picked up by media channels. Therefore awareness of the new company remains quite modest. It confuses both the existing and potential clients who still talk about Assets and Adex. Also, it would potentially have been news for large media channels as the merged company is the fourth or fifth largest in the field of financial services.  This situation, if well exploited, could have been cheap marketing for the new company. Now it takes extra energy to introduce the new name of the company to the public. Apparently, a well-prepared merger plan would have also included carefully planned awareness-raising events. In other words, elaboration of the merger plan would have made the managers to think through the merger from the start to end.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The merger did not require any notable investments. All of the employees continued their work, although in new circumstances. Therefore, they did not need external support either. Ms Tohvri believes that external consultancy could be useful if the process is more extensive or involves several fields of activities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Today, the economic performance of EFTA is about the same that Assets and Adex had before, if added together. EFTA was expected to attract new clients faster. Apparently both the economic conditions as well as lack of awareness-raising activities could be blamed for this not being the case. Assets’ turnover used to grow 25% per year. During the economic boom many new enterprises were founded which helped Assets to grow quickly. Understandably, the same growth rate should not be expected today although a 25% growth rate has also been set as a goal for EFTA. In any case, EFTA is ready for it. At the moment, opportunities to offer financial services to local municipalities are being explored and tested. This could serve as a new growth path.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Tohvri feels more secure as she is supported by internal partners who take care of the processes inside the company, as well as by well chosen external partners. In these circumstances, it is easier to sell its services to local municipalities, for example. She feels she does not sell herself so much anymore but rather the whole agency.</p>\r\n<p>Although the company turnover has not grown much yet, Ms Tohvri believes that internal integration has been more active and deeper than she envisaged.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the number of employees has stayed approximately the same as the two companies added together. In January 2011, there were 26 employees including five on maternity leave; 29 employees (three of them on maternity leave) in January 2012; and 24 employees (three of them on maternity leave) in summer 2012. </p>\r\n<p>For the employees, the whole situation has changed greatly and, according to development manager Ms Sepik, without a doubt in a very positive way. Today employees have, for example, more training opportunities, partly because the larger company can afford more and partly thanks to membership of the Association of Estonian Accounting Firms. Also, the larger company brings about specialisation and offers more opportunities to develop and make a career inside the company. Some employees were offered new and more demanding positions. Also, Ms Sepik believes that although wages have not yet increased they should do in the longer term as a result of the productivity growth.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>This case describes the merger of two small companies providing services. These companies did not receive any advice or financial support for restructuring. As the merger did not require notable investments they did not need any external financing either. What they lacked was know-how. The owners had not experienced any mergers before and did not prepare for the merger thoroughly either. Consequently, they also made mistakes which could probably have been avoided if they had thought through the event in detail before starting the merger.</p>\r\n<p>Although Ms Tohvri did not see the need for consultancy, it could probably have been useful. The cost of a small-scale external consultancy would not have been an obstacle for them either. The use of external consultancy is generally very modest in Estonia for several reasons, such as low awareness of the usefulness of the service, inability to pay for the services and lack of experienced consultants.<SUP> </SUP>Consequently, even if public support in forms of free consultancy would have been available, for example for companies considering a merger, without extensive awareness raising activities the take up of the service would apparently be low. Small companies could benefit from well-prepared free materials on how to manage a merger, including the most common mistakes with examples. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Anne Jürgenson, Praxis Center for Policy Studies</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Ellen Tohvri, one of the owners and managers of EFTA and Ave Sepik, development manager of EFTA (former employee of Assets) </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Eesti Finantsteenuste Agentuur</p>\r\n<p>Jõe 3</p>\r\n<p>Tallinn 10151</p>\r\n<p>Estonia</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.efta.ee/"">http://www.efta.ee/</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3>\r\n<p>ADEX Financial Solutions OÜ homepage, <a HREF=""http://www.adex.ee"">www.adex.ee</a></p>\r\n<p>Assets RMP OÜ homepage, <a HREF=""http://www.assets.ee"">www.assets.ee</a></p>\r\n<p>Association of Estonian Accounting Firms (ERPEL) homepage, <a HREF=""http://www.erpel.ee"">www.erpel.ee</a> </p>\r\n<p>Directo OÜ homepage, <a HREF=""http://www.directo.ee"">www.directo.ee</a></p>\r\n<p>Estonian Business Register Database.</p>\r\n<p>Kaarna, R.; Masso, M.; Rell, M.

"Gruppo Maio, Italy"~"Gruppo Maio"~"<p>Italian waste management business Gruppo Maio has undergone substantial expansion since 2006. This was in part prompted by the entry into managerial positions of two grandchildren of the founder, which resulted in the establishment of new sections and a new wave of recruitment. A legal office and a public relations office were created, activities that were previously outsourced. Other divisions were reorganised. The group also expanded its business activities. To support the restructuring, it invested considerable resources in training and in technological development. The entire business expansion has been financed by the group privately.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Gruppo Maio has been operating for over 25 years in the field of environmental protection through the integrated management of services of collection, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste (industrial and medical waste).</p>\r\n<p>The group is composed of two main companies: Maio Guglielmo s.r.l. and Bleu s.r.l. In addition to these, a third, sister company Thu s.r.l. has been recently established to provide administrative services for the two companies of the group.</p>\r\n<p>Maio Guglielmo s.r.l. was established in June 1983 by Guglielmo Maio, father of Francesco Maio, the group&rsquo;s CEO. The company first started its operations in waste management via the recovery of silver from hospitals&rsquo; x-rays. Subsequently, by late 1980s and mid 1990s the company expanded its business and concentrated on the collection, transportation, storage and disposal of medical waste. The company has two waste storage sites located in Val di Sangro (near the main headquarters) and in Carsoli, in the Lazio region. In Val di Sangro the company also owns an incineration plant, where special waste is thermally destroyed.</p>\r\n<p>In 1989, the owners decided to expand their business establishing a further company, Bleu s.r.l., whose main activity is to collect, transport, store, treat and dispose of non-hazardous industrial waste. Bleu s.r.l. also owns a landfill site in Canosa di Puglia, in the Puglia region of Italy.</p>\r\n<p>Gruppo Maio is now in its third generation. The group was previously family-run; however, in recent years, due to the extensive expansion of its activities, the group shifted towards a more professionally run management and a manager for the group who does not belong to the family has been recruited. However, ownership is entirely in the hands of the founding family and the family is still very involved in management&rsquo;s decisions.</p>\r\n<p>The group now has about 200 employees, however when it started, the group consisted of only three employees: the founder and his two sons. With the expansion of the business towards new activities and with the establishment of Bleu, new divisions were created and employment levels in the group increased extensively, reaching 200 employees at the beginning of 2012. Officially, Bleu s.r.l. has 18 employees and the remaining 180 employees are employed in Thu s.r.l. and MAIO Guglielmo s.r.l. Given the tight knit of relations of the three companies there is a high degree of cross over, and administrative staff of Thu s.r.l. and Maio Guglielmo s.r.l. are also responsible for the administrative activities of the Bleu s.r.l. For this reason, it is quite difficult to provide exact numbers on staff working for each company of the group, as in general, and particularly concerning the administrative side of the business (administration, but also legal division, HR, I &amp;C and so on) most of the employees work for all the companies of the group, rather than for only one specific company.</p>\r\n<p>The majority of the staff are employed as drivers and workers in waste management and waste collection sites. A smaller number of the staff are employed in other divisions: trade and commercial, administration, legal affair division and so on.</p>\r\n<p>The group has a written human resources strategy for both main companies of the group. Human resources management is administered internally by the human resources division.</p>\r\n<p>Within the group there are work councils; however, these have not been involved in the restructuring event as the degree of loyalty and trust between the ownership, the management and the employees has been incredibly high. This resulted in a continuous and fruitful dialogue between the company and its employees, and most of the strategic decisions have been discussed within the company, including employees.</p>\r\n<p>The group is extremely embedded in the local community and most of its employees are from the area. Moreover, in 2008 the owners also bought the local soccer team, increasing their involvement in the community. The owners are originally from the area and they live very close to headquarters of the group.</p>\r\n<p>In recent years, turnover and number of clients increased dramatically and the group has been increasing the scope of its activities. While Maio Guglielmo due to its specific activities has the public sector as its main client, Bleu&rsquo;s clients are all private companies.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of competition, due to the nature of activities, Guglielmo Maio s.r.l. is more exposed to competition. For the activities of Bleu, there is more of a division of the market share with other competitors as the number of landfill sites in the country is rather limited.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Apart from the natural desire to grow and expand its core business, which the Maio Guglielmo&rsquo;s CEO identifies as the natural outcome for an entrepreneur, the restructuring event was facilitated also by the entry into the company of the two recently graduated grandchildren of the founder in managerial positions. The entry of the young resources resulted also in the establishment of new sections and they also lead new wave of recruitment among young people.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Maio Guglielmo&rsquo;s CEO, while expansion of the group was deemed essential and natural, there has not been a written growth strategy or an expansion plan. The group has been actively seeking opportunities on the market and it has assessed each opportunity it was presented with.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>With the entry of new resources in the group in 2006, the group also expanded and re-organised its internal structure. Around that time the legal office and the Communication and Public Relations Office of the Group was created, activities which were previously outsourced to external consultants. At the same time, other divisions, such as the HR division and the trade and commercial divisions were re-organised and new staff were recruited.</p>\r\n<p>As regards the activity of Bleu, the group decided to expand their business in non-hazardous industrial waste management with the construction of a new landfill site in Canosa di Puglia. The new site will border on the landfill site Blu srl already own in the same location. In January 2012 they were in the process of obtaining the authorisation to expand this landfill, however as it will be discussed later, this authorisation process can take up to five years and for these reasons planning of activities in this sector is very difficult.</p>\r\n<p>Maio Guglielmo has also been increasing its activities extensively. The company is in the process of building three new sterilising plants, in Val di Sangro (near the main headquarters), which should be operative by end of 2012. Furthermore, in 2010 the company had the chance to temporarily take over the activities of another company operating in the same sector which had been declared bankrupt. Since then Maio Guglielmo has been temporarily operating in the site located in Gubbio in the Umbria region, where the main activity is medical waste storage. Following this event, Maio Guglielmo had to present an industrial plan to the Ministry of Environment and Local Authorities, envisaging an expansion of its activities on the Gubbio storage site. The company presented a business plan foreseeing the expansion of its activities via the construction of a new strategic sterilising plant. According to the group the construction of the sterilising plant is deemed essential for maintaining profitability of the activities in the Gubbio site. It is now one and half years that the company has been waiting for the authorisation.</p>\r\n<p>As a consequence of the extensive expansion, the group has invested considerable resources in training for its staff and in technological development. In turn, these have enhanced and facilitated the considerable growth of the business and notable expansion of its activity. Moreover, with the expansion of the activities, the group has also introduced management processes characterised by more careful prevention and strict control over the business activities that have potential impacts on the environment. This guarantees the total eco-sustainability of the two companies belonging to the Group.</p>\r\n<p>The entire business expansion has been financed by the group privately and the group has not received any public support. Private funding has also been financing technological development and staff training. Moreover, the group is very proud to claim that it has never made use of any social shock absorbers and has never dismissed a single employee.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The group argues that the main challenge to restructuring rests with the Italian bureaucracy, and its associated lengthy and duplicating processes and requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Notably, the group has been particularly constrained in the expansion of its business activities due to the lengthy authorisation processes for the construction of new plants or sites, which in this sector can take up to five years. This implies a very limited scope in business expansion planning, as well as an extensive curb to business growth.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, as Maio Guglielmo&rsquo;s main client is the public sector, the company suffers much from their delays in payments. This is a huge problem for the Italian economy and Confindustria (the main employer organisation in the sector) estimated that the Italian public administration owes Italian enterprises about &euro;70 billion in unpaid debts. Many of these enterprises are SMEs which are extremely affected by the delays in payments, especially in times of economic downturn when securing financing and credit is already difficult. It is indeed the case that many SMEs were declared bankrupt even if they indeed were owed money from the authorities.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the group also stressed a difficulty in finding information on public and European funding, and on what type of support is available for business expansion. This difficulty consists not only in identifying this information, but also in identifying which actors can provide these information and advice.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The group has not received any type of support during its business expansion and it must be underlined that, as discussed above, the group also encountered difficulties in identifying who could provide this information and support. The group however, has participated in several info days organised by the European Commission in Brussels on the activities of companies operating in the waste management, recycling and green energies sectors. The group argues that these experiences have been very positive and very informative as they even enabled companies with the opportunity to organise bilateral meetings. For these reasons, the group highlights the need for organising and providing these opportunities also at national level.</p>\r\n<p>In its business expansion, the Group has not even been supported or advised by Confindustria, of which it is a member.</p>\r\n<p>However, during its business expansion, the group did extensively use external consultants. In particular, a key element has been represented by the legal division. Given the sensitivity of the sector in which operates, which is highly regulated both at national and European level, the group places a strategic importance on its legal activities. The legal division was created only six years ago, prior to that all legal activities within the group were outsourced. However, even now the company avails of additional legal consultants on an ad-hoc basis.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The group is very confident about its future prospects and the business expansion is considered to be very positive.</p>\r\n<p>The group is also very positive in terms of outcomes on employment levels. Indeed if the authorisations for building a second landfill site in Puglia and the sterilising plant in Gubbio are given, new staff will be recruited for these new sites. In general, new recruits are highly qualified technical staff coming from competitor companies. However in the event of takeovers, such as in the case of the Gubbio site, the company usually retains the existing staff. Indeed in Gubbio they retained all staff previously employed in the site. With regards to the three sterilising sites in Val di Sangro, the groups is currently assessing whether it will implement some reorganisation among the existing staff with new training courses to train existing staff for new tasks and responsibilities, or whether new employees will need to be hired for these new sterilising plants.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the group highlighted how the business expansion of the group has resulted in an increase in the productivity of its employees. Indeed there is a positive and peaceful atmosphere in the group (already before the restructuring) and all employees are happy to be part of this innovative group. These positive outcomes are also reassuring for the employees especially in times of economic uncertainty.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process has not been formally evaluated, neither internally or externally. However the group agrees this might be necessary in the future. Nonetheless, Gruppo Maio strongly argues that the restructuring process has been highly positive and it is also very positive on the future outlook of the company.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>In general, the business expansion has been very positive and the group is very satisfied with the outcomes. These positive feelings are also reflected in the dialogue with staff which has always been highly involved in the development of activities within the group.</p>\r\n<p>The group argues that its main success factor rests with a strong belief in the group potential, the willingness to continuously re-invest their private funds in the business as well as social cohesion within the group. This also explicitly includes the employees, which represent an important part of the group.</p>\r\n<p>The main challenge to restructuring encountered is the Italian bureaucracy and its associated lengthy and duplicating processes and requirements. Moreover, prolonged delays in repayments from the public sector, Maio Guglielmo&rsquo;s main client, imposed a large financial burden on the group.</p>\r\n<p>The group also highlights that SMEs are an incredible source of potential for European economies and as such they should be supported more. Due to their limited size, SMEs are characterised by a high flexibility; this enables them to respond to difficult economic contingencies in a timelier manner. In contrast, larger companies &ndash; while they might be less likely to be affected &ndash; when hit by a crisis, might not be flexible enough to implement those necessary organisational changes in a timely manner. For this reason, SMEs should be more supported, especially in terms of access to financing and capital. SMEs can struggle to obtain the same funding opportunities as their larger counterparts, and this is especially the case in Italy, where private investors and business angels are lacking.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Lidia Salvatore, Eurofound</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Guglielmo Maio, CEO of Maio Guglielmo Srl and Brand Manager of the Maio Group</p>\r\n<p>Camillo D&rsquo;Alessandro, Head of Communications and Public Relations Maio Group</p>\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.gruppomaio.com/"">http://www.gruppomaio.com/</a></p>"~"Italy"~"38 - waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery"~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"business expansion"~"2012-02-02"
"Astel, Estonia"~"Astel OÜ"~"<p>With the aim of making business processes more efficient, Estonian firm Astel decided to focus on its core activities by reducing its number of production units. While the remaining production site was technologically upgraded and expanded, resulting in an increase in staff numbers, some of the activities previously done in-house were outsourced within Estonia by increasing the volume of contracts already in place.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Astel OÜ produces timber products, its main production comprising summer houses and garden cabins made of milled timber. These are mainly mass produced, but the models given by clients are also produced according to their specifications. The company aims to give a flexible service, small batches are produced and both small and large-scale special projects are carried out.</p>\r\n<p>The company was established in 1991 and has produced timber products for over 20 years. Astel OÜ operates in a small town in South Estonia. Nowadays, the production has been concentrated in one factory in Räpina, but before restructuring, it was dispersed throughout the region with four different production units within a 30 km radius. The company has remained legally independent and has not belonged to any group during its activity.</p>\r\n<p>It is a family company and the present owners include the representatives of different generations of the family. The company is managed by the Chief Executive, who is one of the owners of the company. The company employs 55 people, 70% of whom are skilled workers, 25% are unskilled workers and 5% are managers. The work at the factory is managed by the Production Manager and there are two foremen at the factory managing smaller production units. There are two persons working in the sales unit, a Sales Manager and Sales Assistant, and the company has one designer. The personnel of the company mainly comprise men aged 25–50 years. The employees of the company are not members of any trade union and no separate Human Resources or Corporate Social Responsibility strategy has been developed in the company.</p>\r\n<p>The company is oriented towards exports, selling 99% of its production in foreign markets and only 1% in the Estonian domestic market. The main target countries include the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Finland and Germany. The products are also sold outside the EU, for example, in Norway. The company considers its strengths to be foreign markets, sufficient production capacity and fast delivery time. One major drawback is the fact that the clients have different preferences regarding timber houses in different areas. While this does not allow for cheaper mass production, it makes the company produce small batches and perform special projects which require more resources. The raw material necessary for the production of timber houses is imported by the company mainly from Russia and Latvia.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, before restructuring, the company consisted of four different production units, all of which were involved in various activities related to the production of timber houses. Altogether, 74 employees worked in the company before restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>The Niitsiku factory produced windows and doors for the houses. A total of 14 employees were employed at the Niitsiku factory and the production of the unit comprised around 10% of turnover. The Veriora factory dealt with the storage and distribution, sawing, drying of round wood and production of furniture pieces and also loading of timber delivered by rail; 20 persons were employed in this unit and its turnover comprised around 25% of the total turnover. The Räpina 1 Factory produced hand-made log houses, employing ten persons and comprising around 10% of turnover. The fourth and largest production unit was the Räpina 2 factory, which produced garden cabins made of milled logs. Before restructuring, it employed 30 persons and its turnover comprised over 50% of total turnover.</p>\r\n<p>The company was dispersed within a 30 km radius in the region and there were duplicated functions and jobs in the sub-units of the company, which were mostly related to ancillary activities, for example security guards and cleaners.</p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of 2008, there was a decline in foreign demand, the number of orders decreased and the payment record of clients deteriorated. The need for investments was also a high priority in the company, since the technology had not been updated in all fields of activity. It was clear that more up-to-date technology was crucial to ensuring the quality of the products in order to remain competitive in the production of timber houses in foreign markets. It was clear to the managers and owners that the necessary investments could not be made in all fields of activity, especially during the economic downturn. In addition, the economic crisis saw the start of a liquidity problem which deteriorated. A sharp decrease in the number of orders could be seen by the second half of 2008, which led to a decrease in company sales turnover.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The owners and manager of the company felt during the first half of 2008 that the company could no longer be effectively managed and all the various fields of activity in the different locations could no longer be kept in operation. In order to prevent the company from getting into financial problems and avoid the risk of liquidation, the owners of the company decided to undertake restructuring. A change in the structure of the company was planned: to focus on one main activity, close unnecessary production units and incorporate the production into one main place of business. In the course of restructuring, the number of employees also had to be reduced.</p>\r\n<p>The plan for restructuring was developed by the owners of the company, using legal advice from relevant experts and the services of a law office. The employees of the company were not involved in the planning stage. There was a flexible scheduled plan for restructuring and it was agreed among the owners that the market situation would be followed carefully, both the financial situation and general situation of the timber market. The owners were ready to respond quickly to the changed situation. </p>\r\n<p>No separate financing or financial benefits were used for the restructuring. The expenses related to restructuring were partially covered by the sale of assets. Negotiations were held with the main creditors – that is, banks – concerning the extension of short-term liabilities. Payment schedules were used with the suppliers, as a result of which the payment periods became longer. The expenses related to redundancy were partially covered by unemployment insurance. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was carried out during 2008 and 2009, in the course of which only the main activity in one location in Räpina remained (see figure 2). In other locations, the activity was terminated and the production units were closed or expropriated. A holding company (Simpes Grupp OÜ) was established, to which the assets and sales unit of the company belong and Astel OÜ became a production unit.</p>\r\n<p>The Niitsiku production unit was closed and the buildings were retained. The Veriora production unit was closed and the assets were expropriated to increase liquidity. The production of hand-made log houses was terminated and the assets were leased to an independent company which continued the same activity. The Räpina 2 factory remained in operation and the main activity – the production of garden cabins made of milled logs – was expanded there. </p>\r\n<p>In the beginning of 2009, an additional investment was made in the main production in Räpina for the purpose of updating technology and the sales unit was expanded. The number of factory workers also increased. The new expanded production unit employed the skilled workers who had mainly worked in the units that had closed down. </p>\r\n<p>The production process was reorganised and outsourcing within Estonia was used for the activities which had ceased. Before reorganisation, the proportion of outsourcing concerning the windows and doors was just 10% and own production was predominant. After reorganisation, 60% of all the windows and doors necessary for production were bought in. Astel used the same outsourcing partner as before reorganisation and increased the volume of the contract. The owners were satisfied with the quality of their workmanship and the cooperation was positive.</p>\r\n<p>The workers were not informed in advance of the plan and course of reorganisation. They were notified during the course of the process. However, most workers had noticed that the work volume had decreased and they expected that there would be changes. The owners and the Chief Executive relocated the workers within the company as much as possible. Skilled workers were offered the opportunity to start work at the Räpina production unit. Some workers were relocated to work under a new owner after the sale of company assets. Redundancy was used where unemployment insurance compensated for the expenses, and lay-off with minimum salary was used for a certain period (mostly during reorganisation of the Veriora production unit). </p>\r\n<p>One of the main problems related to the workers was their lack of interest in moving to work in another neighbouring region. The workers who were offered a job necessitating the same skills and competence were not interested in starting work in another region, although the distance between the Niitsiku and Räpina production units is only 30 km. In Estonia the mobility of workers is quite low. The same problem occurred in Astel as well. Therefore, the workers left the company and tried to find a job nearer to home.</p>\r\n<p>To sum up, the financial indicators of the company began to improve, the sales turnover and exports increased and new target markets could be entered.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>One of the key issues for the owners was financing the restructuring. The situation in the financial market was poor and taking on an additional loan was out of the question. It was decided not to use additional financial resources for reorganisation, but rather manage with the money received from the sale of assets and with internal resources. Another important step in improving liquidity was negotiations with the creditors, mostly the banks, in order to extend the due dates of liabilities. Since many companies encountered financial problems in the sector, the banks believed it was very important to support the restructuring of companies and agreed to extend the liabilities. The negotiations held with the banks concerning the competent reorganisation plan and steps were of crucial importance. Thus, reorganisation was successful in part due to the fact that the creditors were flexible.</p>\r\n<p>Another important challenge was to carry out the restructuring process in a way that would least affect the local labour market. Since it is a small region and the company was an important employer in the region where both owners and workers have lived in the same community for a long time and everybody knows each other, the owners did not want the reorganisation to damage the reputation of the company. </p>\r\n<p>Changes in the company led to an increase in workload and more diverse tasks which the workers often did not want to accept. The owners were also forced to use fixed-term employment contracts and lower wages for some jobs. All these activities contributed to  reducing the motivation of workers. After the changes were carried out, one of the greatest challenges for the Chief Executive was to restore and maintain the trust of workers. </p>\r\n<p>In the course of the restructuring, the owners and Chief Executive realised that the current business plan had been too flexible and had not ensured sufficient efficiency. Therefore, it was decided to focus on mass production in the restructured production and only produce one type of log house. The manufacture of hand-made log houses was completely terminated and it was decided to close all ancillary activities, such as the storage and primary processing of raw material or manufacture of accessories for production. The purchase of raw material and use of outsourcing led to significantly increasing the efficiency of the main production. The performance of special projects according to clients’ wishes was also cut to a minimum.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The plan for restructuring was developed mainly by the owners of the company. External legal advice was used and the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund was consulted. No additional financial help was used and the employees of the company were not directly involved in the decision process.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>After restructuring, the efficiency of the company was increased and a focus placed on the more profitable production by concentrating on one specific activity. The production process was reorganised and the raw material and accessories necessary for production are now purchased through outsourcing. The efficiency could also be improved by concentrating production activity in one region and hence avoiding duplicating functions. </p>\r\n<p>After restructuring, the owners and the Chief Executive had to quickly stabilise the cash flows in which they succeeded as during restructuring attention was drawn also to improving the efficiency of the sales functions. In general, the recovery of foreign demand could be seen in the market for timber houses and the expanded sales unit was able to increase export activity. Today, the company exports 99% of its products and the portfolio of target countries is differentiated as the products are sold in the EU as well as outside of the EU., for example, in Norway, Iceland, etc. The sales turnover reached € 2.4 million in 2009 and € 3.2 million in 2010. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring meant that in a small town in south Estonia production activity and jobs could be preserved for almost 60 persons. Since the Estonian labour market is flexible, labour costs could be cut in various ways, especially since during the economic recession, salaries were lowered, fixed-term employment contracts are still used and seasonal workers are used. Stable conditions could be maintained for the current workers and the owners also plan to increase employment in line with the expansion of production.</p>\r\n<p>The owners learned a lesson from the experience that foreign demand should be followed carefully and the so-called controlled growth planned according to demand when making future expansion decisions. The preconditions for growth are an effective work process, improvements in technology, following the prices of production inputs and flexible employment contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>According to the owners and Chief Executive of Astel OÜ, the restructuring was successful due to the fact that the owners quickly and flexibly responded to the first signs of financial difficulties. Since the owners were familiar with the business activity through its management on an everyday basis, the signs of the approaching economic crisis were noticed very early on and decisions made quickly on carrying out the changes.  It is one of the advantages of SMEs that the owners are often managers, as they are in constant and immediate contact with business activity and results.</p>\r\n<p>For SMEs, the costs required for changes may be lower; however, if additional financial resources are not used, it could be more complicated to finance the changes, since the current cash flows are smaller and more unstable. The advantage that bigger companies have are a better financial basis, sufficient resources and more capability to use finances during turbulent periods, since the banks favour bigger and more stable companies. </p>\r\n<p>During the restructuring process, it is important to equally follow all the production links: input, production basis, technology, production, production methods, and employees. Restructuring does not only imply closure, liquidation and redundancy, but to be successful investments must be made and new structural units created simultaneously, if required. In the case described above, the owners of the company saw the need for additional investment, in order to create an adequate production basis for the main activity.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Chief Executive of the company, restructuring requires focusing on a well-considered, conservative business plan and not immediately being swept along in the change of tides. It is necessary to be constantly alert to the market conditions in order to quickly respond to the changes and be in a position to make quick and bold decisions. </p>\r\n<p>Estonian companies are supported by a flexible labour market in carrying out their decisions. While operating in a single community in a small region, companies inevitably have a certain social responsibility; however, employees’ readiness to be more flexible should be encouraged.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Mari Rell, Praxis Center for Policy Studies</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Raul Kinks, Chief Executive, and the Accountant, Astel OÜ </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Astel OÜ </p>\r\n<p>Meeksi mnt 32</p>\r\n<p>Räpina 64506</p>\r\n<p>Estonia</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.astel.ee"">www.astel.ee</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3>\r\n<p>Estonian Business Register Database</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Estonia"~"16 - manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture; manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"flexicurity*recession/crisis"~"business expansion*internal restructuring*outsourcing"~"2012-03-25"
" Banque Havilland, Luxembourg "~"Banque Havilland S.A."~"<p>After the major banking and financial crisis in Iceland, in October 2008 Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. entered a suspension of payment procedure. The administrators launched a tender to sell the bank’s activities and assets. The offer submitted by the Rowland family was accepted. The new bank, Banque Havilland S.A., offers private banking services. The restructuring resulted in staff cuts of 150, a reduction in assets and profitability. Although clients’ deposits were preserved, there was a radical change in business model. The bank currently employs around 50 in Luxembourg, and several more in subsidiaries.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Background information on the company</h3>\r\n<p>Banque Havilland S.A. (before restructuring it was Kaupthing Luxembourg S.A.) is a bank with private banking services. It offers banking services, investment management and wealth structuring. Banque Havilland S.A. is 100% owned by the Rowland family. It has a representative office in London and a subsidiary in Monaco: Monaco employs ten people and the London office two. Banque Havilland, moreover, has an additional subsidiary, BlackFish Capital Management (BCM), a UK-based investment firm providing support to the bank’s asset management division. BCM employs just a few persons. The number of employees in Luxembourg is slightly over fifty persons. In total, these entities, which are all owned by the Rowland family, have less than a hundred employees. The education and professional background of Banque Havilland’s employees in Luxembourg is diverse, with 90% of all employees holding a university degree.</p>\r\n<p>The activities of Banque Havilland qualify as ‘international’. The bank has entities abroad and, like other banks established in Luxembourg, the bank drains clients from abroad, including from Nordic countries (former clients of Kaupthing Bank). </p>\r\n<p>As will be shown below, the bank used to meet the employee number threshold for having a work council. The bank currently has workers’ representatives. ALEBA, the trade union for bank and insurance  employees in Luxembourg, was notably involved in the negotiation of the two social plans implemented during the restructuring process. </p>\r\n<p>Banque Havilland S.A. had on 10 July 2009, date of the opening of the bank, a starting balance of €1,305 million. It appears from the annual consolidated accounts, as available on the website of the Luxembourg commercial register (<i>registre du commerce</i>), that: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The net profits after tax for the year 2009 are\r\n€6.8 million; </li>\r\n<li>The total assets for the year 2009 are €1,272.3\r\nmillion; </li>\r\n<li>The net profits after tax for the year 2010 are\r\n€16.2 million; and</li>\r\n<li>The total assets for the year 2010 are €935.5\r\nmillion. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Chief Executive Officer of Banque Havilland, Jean-François Willems (35 years old) obtained a Business Administration degree from the University of Liège, Belgium, in 1999. He then joined PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) Luxembourg, where he had the opportunity to actively participate in the development of the corporate finance activities of the company. His experience at PWC includes international work: a nine-month secondment in Frankfurt, Germany. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Willems joined Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. in 2007, where he was in charge of investment banking and corporate finance. Following the application of the bank for suspension of payment, Mr Willems actively participated in the restructuring process of the bank, a long-haul and intense working experience that lasted approximately nine months. He became CEO of Banque Havilland S.A. following the arrest and subsequent dismissal of functions of Mr Magnus Gudmundsson, former CEO and founder of Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A.</p>\r\n<p>The interviewed employee, Marlène Colmant, started working for Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. in 2003. Back then, the bank numbered around 50 employees, which corresponds to the number of employees Banque Havilland S.A. has today. Ms Colmant is a French citizen, commuting to Luxembourg on a daily basis. She is 41 years old and holds a degree in English, from a French university. She complemented her education by following several specific training programmes, which brought her into the banking sector. She had the status of workers’ representative, following the social elections of November 2008 until November 2009, when she resigned from this post.  She explained that the redundancy programme contained, for each dismissed employee, some financial support for education, some additional support for those who did not find a new job within a certain period of time, as well as some financial support for workers’ children. The redundancy programme also included support for finding a new job.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>Kaupthing Bank was an international Icelandic bank, headquartered in Reykjavík, Iceland, one of the three largest banks in Iceland. On 9 October 2008, following a major banking and financial crisis in Iceland, which involved the collapse of all three of the country's major commercial banks, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority took control of Kaupthing Iceland. It assumed the power of the shareholders of the bank and appointed a Resolution Committee to replace the Board of Directors, which was granted a moratorium on payments to creditors. The United Kingdom government immediately froze the British assets of one of the failed Icelandic banks, including Landsbanki and also seized the assets of Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander, the British subsidiary of Kaupthing Iceland, on the basis of anti-terrorism law. </p>\r\n<p>Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. found it impossible to refinance itself, notably as a consequence of the freeze in the UK, which placed the bank in a cross-default situation towards its own creditors. Moreover, Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. was put in a situation of cross-defaults of bonds issued by it, following what the bank’s creditors would have been entitled to immediately require the execution of their bonds. Under such circumstances, Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg’s Board of Directors immediately applied for and obtained on 9 October 2008 its admission to the regime of suspension of payment (<i>sursis de paiement</i>), by order of Luxembourg’s District Court. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The launch of this suspension of payment procedure involved the suspension of all payments by the Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. (hereafter ‘the Bank’), including any withdrawal of deposits. The Bank’s management and other organs remained in place during the procedure, but all its activities became supervised by the Court appointed administrators, PricewaterhouseCoopers S.à.r.l., represented by Emmanuelle Caruel-Henniaux and Franz Fayot. (The role of the Administrators is, according to the provisions of the Luxembourg law of 5 April 1993 on the financial sector, to control the management of the assets of the Bank and especially to protect the Bank’s assets, safeguard the clients’ deposits and ensure equal treatment of creditors).</p>\r\n<p>The administrators immediately began to explore, with the support of the management, all possible ways out of the Bank’s suspension of payment and eventually launched a tender procedure to sell the Bank’s activities and assets. Following the expression of interest of a Libyan sovereign fund, the administrator prepared a first restructuring plan, which was rejected by the creditors on 16 March 2009. </p>\r\n<p>In the course of April 2009, two additional bidders expressed their interest to the administrators and the Bank. After discussions with all relevant stakeholders, including among others the Luxembourg State, the Belgian State, the <i>Association de Garantie des Dépôts du Luxembourg</i> (<b>AGDL</b>), who operates Luxembourg’s deposit protection scheme, and the interbank creditors, it became clear that the offer submitted by the Rowland family would most likely allow the successful restructuring of the Bank. </p>\r\n<p>The administrators thus prepared and submitted to the Court a second updated restructuring plan, which was eventually accepted by a double majority of the Bank’s interbank creditors on 5 July 2009 and was validated by the Luxembourg District Court on 8 July 2009. As the restructuring plan involved aid subvention by the Luxembourg and Belgian states (see below for more details), the intervention was approved by the European Commission, under the compulsory State Aid notification regime, by a decision dated 9 July 2009.    </p>\r\n<p>Overall, there was no real ‘plan’ for restructuring as the decision to restructure, which started by the application for suspension of payment procedure, was taken in emergency, in the context described above. The managers and administrators followed the legal procedure, whose central element consisted in obtaining the creditors’ agreements on the restructuring plan, to be approved by the creditors. The restructuring ‘plan’ in the present case study is more of a formal legal requirement rather than a plan aiming at implementing a new vision for the future. </p>\r\n<p>The second restructuring plan envisaged a de-merger of the Bank into:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An entity that would continue its banking activities\r\n– which later became Banque Havilland S.A.; and </li>\r\n<li>A special purpose vehicle (<b>SPV</b>) that\r\nwould hold assets and liabilities, for which no buyer was found. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The private and deposit banking activities in Luxembourg were taken over by the UK investment firm BlackFish Capital Management. The new bank, Banque Havilland S.A., had a starting balance of €1,305 million, of which €750-800 million represented the Bank’s existing commitment to the Central Bank of Luxembourg. The buyer contributed to €50 million of cash as capital increase. The transfer covered the Bank’s entire infrastructure (assets, deposits, etc.), including other infrastructure such as the IT systems and headquarters (premises). </p>\r\n<p>All the Bank’s other assets (€1,206 million), corresponding principally to the Bank’s commercial lending operations, for which no buyer was found during the restructuring procedure, were transferred into the SPV, the liabilities relating to which consisted essentially in the Bank’s debts towards the Luxembourg State, the AGDL, and the Bank’s interbank creditors. The SPV took the assets, not infrastructure or employees. It is run by a committee appointed by creditors with a stake in the SPV and is managed on a day-to-day basis by a dedicated team of professionals at Banque Havilland. As of today (mid-2012) the creditors have collected approximately 50% of their initial exposure.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned above, the updated restructuring plan was notably based on state intervention by the Luxembourg and Belgian governments, whose main purpose was to cover potential withdrawals by depositors who, at the end of the suspension of payment period, would be entitled to seek full reimbursement of their deposits. The intervention took the form of a loan from the Luxembourg state to the Bank of €320 million (made up of the liquidity shortfall of €310 million plus a margin of €10 million), which was to be paid in two tranches, to be granted to the Bank immediately after the split. The loan, which did not bear interests, was repaid immediately, the state accepting bonds issued by the SPV as way of payment. As the bulk of the deposits stem from the Bank’s Belgian activities, the loan from the Luxembourg State was granted in cooperation with the Belgian authorities, who agreed to extend to the Luxembourg state a loan totalling €160 million.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring involved several staffing cuts. Reductions in staff was actually one of the conditions set up by the buyer for taking over the Bank’s activities. These cuts occurred in several stages: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>From the moment of payment suspension on, when\r\napproximately 40 out of a total of 200 employees left the bank of their own\r\nwill; </li>\r\n<li>A first and a second formal cut from 160 to 120 employees\r\nand from 120 to 80 employees respectively occurred following the opening of the\r\nnew bank, on the basis of a redundancy programme (<i>plan social</i>). The\r\nredundancy programme is activated, under the Luxembourg law on collective\r\ndismissals, when there are at least seven cases of dismissals during a 30-day\r\nperiod or nine during a three-month period, for reasons unrelated to the\r\nemployee’s behaviour. In the programme, an identification of the employees\r\nwho will be dismissed is made on the basis of predefined criteria. Packages that\r\nare offered to them are negotiated with employee representatives and relevant\r\ntrade unions. Packages include financial compensation as well as other relevant\r\nbenefits, such as training with the view of finding a new position. </li>\r\n<li>Twelve months later, a final cut from 80 to 50 employees\r\noccurred, on the basis of a voluntary scheme: a private offer was made to those\r\nemployees who wished to leave the company on a voluntary basis (compensation,\r\nbenefits, etc.). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Finally, the restructuring process entailed a radical change of business model and philosophy imposed by the buyer. As Jonathan Rowland, son of Banque Havilland’s sole shareholder, David Rowland, put it at the opening event of Banque Havilland: </p>\r\n<BLOCK-QUOTE><p>\r\n<i>‘The family has a wealth of investment experience\r\nspanning forty-five years and has been involved in operating businesses around\r\nthe world. I am keen to look to the future with a highly motivated team and\r\nconsider Banque Havilland as a challenging opportunity. The Bank will be run\r\nconservatively as financial conservatism has always been a hallmark of the\r\nfamily’.\r\n</i> </p></BLOCK-QUOTE><p>It appears from this that the new owners of the bank imposed a new mission statement of the bank, based on risk-reduction and sound management. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring and its aftermath entailed additional difficulties, some of which were specifically related to the banking sector and the financial crisis. </p>\r\n<p>The first difficulty was the radical change of business model and philosophy imposed by the buyer. According to Mr Willems, this u-turn policy was difficult to put into place, perhaps partly because 80-85% of the new bank’s employees were former Kaupthing Luxembourg’s employees, who were used to working in a Scandinavian work environment and under a philosophy that encourages risk-taking. </p>\r\n<p>Two additional events shocked the remaining workforce of the bank: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Luxembourg prosecutors performed several searches at the\r\nbank premises following an international letters rogatory (<i>commission\r\nrogatoire internationale</i>) initiated by Icelandic prosecutors, end of\r\n2009/beginning of 2010, as reported in the media. </li>\r\n<li>The holding in custody of the former CEO and founder of\r\nKaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A., Magnus Gudmundsson, following an invitation of\r\nIcelandic authorities to provide explanations. This detention led to the\r\nimmediate removal of Mr Gudmundsson from his CEO functions, as announced in the\r\npress on 7 May 2010. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As was evident from the employee interview, former employees of Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. had a strong feeling of loyalty towards Mr Gudmundsson and more generally towards the bank itself, which made these events particularly painful for them.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, Mr Willems explains that the collective dismissal procedure for economic difficulties, including the setting up of a redundancy programme, is a complex process to manage, due to the compulsory social dialogue that must occur between the company’s management, the trade union involved – ALEBA – and the workers’ representatives (work council). According to him, the redundancy programme that was put forward was reasonable, including the fair treatment of people affected by collective dismissals, which ended up to the approval of the programme by all parties around the negotiation table. The package notably included longer notice periods for job searching and a training plan. </p>\r\n<p>An additional element that did not facilitate the restructuring process related to social law in Luxembourg is the five-year social election that took place in November 2009. Following this election, six workers’ representatives (<i>délégués sociaux</i>) and six deputy worker’s representatives were elected, all of whom were immune from dismissal. This was seen as problematic by the management (see below for more details on this issue). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Financial and non-financial support was an integral part of the restructuring plan. As mentioned above, the updated restructuring plan was notably based on a state intervention from Luxembourg and Belgium, whose main purpose was to cover potential withdrawals by depositors who, at the end of the suspension of payment period, would be entitled to seek full reimbursement of their deposits. As the bulk of the deposits stem from the Bank’s Belgian activities, the loan from the Luxembourg state was granted in cooperation with the Belgian authorities, who agreed to extend to the Luxembourg state a loan totalling €160 million.</p>\r\n<p>This also means that the bank benefitted from external expertise, including expertise from high-profile lawyers and other financial experts. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>On the one hand, the outcome of restructuring may be qualified as overall positive as the main purpose of the restructuring process – preserving the deposits of clients – was achieved. On the other hand, the restructuring ended in a reduction of the Bank’s assets, profitability as well as of its number of employees. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Willems reports that, during the successive staff cuts, a list of approximately 15 key people circulated among the management, identifying the persons who absolutely needed to stay for the good order of the restructuring. The purpose of this list was to avoid the departure of these key workforce elements. </p>\r\n<p>With respect to employees’ reaction towards the restructuring, Mr Willems explains that the process was emotionally painful for them, which may be explained by the fact that there was substantial employee loyalty towards the former CEO and founder of the Bank, Mr Gudmundsson, and towards the Bank in general. Moreover, numerous employees were left inactive during the process, due to the freeze of the bank’s activities and assets, which means they had no work to do and this was very difficult for them. </p>\r\n<p>Ms Colmant confirms that the process was emotionally painful for employees, highlighting that tensions arose among employees for several reasons, notably due to the the fact that some workers’ representatives were immune from staff-cutting. Another example is the suspicion arising in the context of collective dismissals, where employees felt that there would not be enough work for everyone, creating a difficult work atmosphere. Ms Colmant herself had her personal doubts, of course. In addition, employees started lacking motivation as business fell (payment suspension), which was difficult from a psychological viewpoint. </p>\r\n<p>One remarkable element is the transparent communication policy implemented from the very first day of the restructuring process by the management, during the whole process until its end. On an almost daily basis, the CEO or Mr Willems would go and talk, generally early in the morning in the Bank’s canteen, to the employees about successive small achievements and failures of the previous day/night. This may also explain the loyalty of employees to the Bank and more specifically to the Mr Gudmundsson and to the management. Ms Colmant confirms this and said that despite the tensions, there were strong bonds between employees, the bank and the management. </p>\r\n<p>With respect to information of clients, during the nine months of payment suspension there was a permanent communication with the clients, namely with the ‘K Group’ (Belgian clients), who were very supportive, according to Mr Willems. </p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of Kaupthing Bank time, Ms Colmant was responsible for assets management –pricing, update of prices, creation of securities (<i>titres</i>), and so on. The bank’s development largely confined Ms Colmant role to fund custody (settlements, payments) and corporate actions. Nevertheless, during the suspension of payments’ period, she got promoted and became responsible for back office transactions on securities. Following the restructuring, her weight within the bank increased once more by being responsible for the whole back office. She describes her job as being multi-task, and explains this is due to the reduced current number of employees. When Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. counted almost two hundred employees, her job was narrower than it is today. </p>\r\n<p>Following the restructuring, the scope of activities of Banque Havilland S.A. was reduced in comparison to the scope of activities of Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. covered not only private banking, but also establishment and management of holding companies and corporate and investment banking services. It also accepted online deposits from retail banking customers in Luxembourg and Belgium. The corporate philosophy also changed drastically following the restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>From the point of view of Ms Colmant, the restructuring had several impacts on work organisation: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The restructuring changed work organisation: employees\r\nhad to learn and develop new skills, perform new tasks and take additional\r\nresponsibilities. This is a direct consequence of the successive waves of\r\ncollective dismissals: some people who performed some functions left the company\r\nbut these functions had to be taken over by those who remained in the bank. For\r\ninstance, Ms Colmant faced an increase of responsibilities and a diversification\r\nof these. Regarding the loss of expertise following staff departure, as stated\r\nabove, the management had a list of key-people who were all successfully\r\nretained through the restructuring period. More generally, the bank has been\r\nsuccessful in conveying its corporate message to the people who were needed for\r\nbuilding the new bank. During downsizing, the bank hardly lost any staff who the\r\nmanagement wanted to retain. </li>\r\n<li>Relationship with management changed as top managers\r\nchanged. This is all the more true due to the fact that the philosophy of the\r\nbank changed, which implied for some employees a change of behaviour (less\r\nrisk-taking). Ms Colmant sees this as a positive element.</li>\r\n<li>The opening of the new bank involved the implementation\r\nof new procedures and processes, which was for her a source of excitement and of\r\nmotivation. </li>\r\n<li>The overall environment of her department changed: it is\r\nnow less international than it was before, even if the work is still carried out\r\nin English.  </li>\r\n<li>The restructuring allowed her personally to gain in\r\nconfidence, as she felt trusted and appreciated by the management with the\r\nincrease in her responsibilities. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Several lessons may be drawn from the restructuring of Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the creation of Banque Havilland S.A.: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The applicable Luxembourg legal framework is not adapted\r\nto companies dealing with numerous stakeholders from various backgrounds, such\r\nas banks and other financial institutions. </li>\r\n<li>The fact that the Bank was a small bank somehow\r\n‘facilitated’ the process –although the process was far from\r\nbeing easy, as approximately 20% of the employees hold 80% of the information\r\nneeded for going through the restructuring process. This makes it relatively\r\neasy to retrieve information that is necessary to go through the process, such\r\nas figures for setting up the restructuring plan, details on employees,\r\netc.</li>\r\n<li>The restructuring process was so complicated (filing for\r\nbankruptcy, old fashioned procedure not adapted to modern finance and banking,\r\nno precedent, urgency and deadlines of the procedure, dealing with hundreds of\r\ncreditors, and the like) that, should the management/the administrators have\r\nknown the difficulties they would have to face beforehand, they would have\r\nsimply not gone through the search of a buyer and applied for bankruptcy. It\r\nappears from this case study that it would be worth rethinking restructuring\r\nprocedures as currently applicable to the financial sector.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It is the impression of the author of this report that one of the main factors explaining why the management fought so hard to go through the whole restructuring process, despite the enormous difficulties, are primarily the personality of some key persons in the management team, including the current CEO, Mr Willems, and secondly, (the fact that the Bank was a small bank, whose development and success is partly attributed to the personal efforts of the former CEO and founder of the Bank, Magnus Gudmundsson</p>\r\n<p>Mr Willems furthermore illustrates that the legal procedure, whose central element consisted in obtaining the creditors’ agreements on the restructuring plan, was not adequate for the Bank’s situation, including the following elements: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>After the rejection of the first restructuring plan, the\r\nLuxembourg District Court granted an extension to the suspension of payment\r\nproceedings in order for the Administrators to prepare a second restructuring\r\nplan and to negotiate with other potential investors. The extension was\r\nconsidered pragmatic, but attracted some debate given the absence of any\r\nprovisions in Luxembourg law allowing such extension. </li>\r\n<li>The Bank’s lawyers succeeded in obtaining the\r\nlimitation of the scope of the creditors’ agreement required under\r\nLuxembourg law to the agreement of the so-called ‘Restructured\r\nCreditors’ – the main creditors of the banks – generally\r\ninstitutions loaning money to banks against remuneration. This demonstrates that\r\nthe legal requirement to obtain the creditors’ agreement upon double\r\nmajority vote is not adapted to a bank’s life, where numerous stakeholders\r\nof diverging nature are involved. This issue was debated before the District\r\nCourt first, who rejected it, and then was appealed before the <i>Court\r\nd’Appel de Luxembourg</i>, who eventually\r\ndecided that the Administrators must seek the\r\nadherence of a limited number of creditors on 28 January 2009. </li>\r\n<li>The suspension of payment has, under Luxembourg, the\r\nconsequence of isolating the entity requesting suspension from the rest of its\r\ncompany group (among others). This prevented the execution of intra-group debt\r\nscheduling, which complicated the restructuring process, according to Mr\r\nWillems.       </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Ms Colmant does not see how things could have been carried out otherwise. She explains that restructuring procedures such as the one undergone by the bank must entail some unexpected elements. She believes the management and the administrators have done a huge job in saving the bank. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Cécile Musialski, Philippe &amp; partners</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Jean-François Willems, General Manager, and Marlène Colmant, employee, Banque Havilland</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.banquehavilland.com/"">http://www.banquehavilland.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3>\r\n<p>Publicly available information, stemming from press articles (www.finanznachrichten.de, www.efinancialnews.com, www.guardian.co.uk, www.news-banque.com, www.nytimes.com, www.paperjam.lu, www.lequotidien.lu), online newsletters (<a HREF=""http://www.linklaters.com"">www.linklaters.com</a>) and press releases available on the website of Banque Havilland.</p>\r\n<p>The European Commission’s State aid decision N° 344/2009 – Luxembourg and N° 380/2009 – Belgium, on restructuring aid for Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg S.A., publicly available on the website of the Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Luxembourg"~"64 - financial service activities, except insurance and pension funding"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"(avoiding) bankruptcy*internal restructuring"~"2012-05-21"
"Biliński,Poland"~"Zakład Włókienniczy Biliński Sp. J"~"<p>The Biliński family business in the textile sector goes back to 1991 and the systemic change in Poland. During the period 2008&ndash;2012 the business underwent intense restructuring that included modernising production equipment and processes, environmental improvements, moving to new premises and building export sales. Multi-year plans, discussion with the council of employees and some state aid under EU Structural Funds brought the company to having 178 staff (better paid and qualified than in the past) and access to export markets.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The present company, Zaklad Wł&oacute;kienniczy Biliński Sp. J., was established in 2008 as a legal partnership. It is owned by Waldemar Biliński (father) and Kamil Biliński (son), who co-manages the business with his father. Waldemar Biliński (aged 65 years), a co-owner of the company, started to work 45 years ago in the State Cotton Enterprise, in the dyeing and finishing mill. He gradually followed all the stages of his professional career, from the position of foreman to manager of the dyeing mill (in 1989). The other co-owner, Kamil Biliński (aged 35 years), Waldemar&rsquo;s son, completed engineering studies at the Technical University in Ł&oacute;dź, specialising in the chemical processing of fibres. Kamil has worked with his father at their family business as its director since he graduated from university.</p>\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s history goes back to 1991, the first year of the systemic transformation in Poland. In that year, Waldemar Bilinski registered the Farbolux&ndash;Bilinski fabric dye-works, financing it partly with borrowed credit (the interest rate at 61.5% p.a.). The textile plant initially had one pressure dyeing machine, which was significantly worn out technically and economically, several second-hand tape dyeing machines, one dryer and a Textima calender, which were purchased from liquidated state textile enterprises. In the first year of its operations, the Farbolux&ndash;Biliński company employed eight employees in total, including its owner.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks to the commitment of the owner and the crew, the investment credit borrowed was paid off in the second year of the operations. All the revenues were spent on purchasing more modern and efficient equipment, which facilitated a very dynamic business development. By the late 1990s, the Farbolux&ndash;Biliński textile plant had state-of-the-art technical solutions for textile machinery manufactured by such international manufacturers as Thies, MCS, Ferraro, Mario Crosta, etc., and quickly obtained the position of local market leader. Its investments reached &euro;1.5 million (2006).</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>The year 2007&ndash;2008 marked the beginning of swift and intense business restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>In 2007 &ndash; the period before major development and modernisation took place &ndash; Farbolux &ndash;Biliński employed 65 persons and used the whole limited production space, which due to the fact that the facility was located in the city of L&oacute;dz, could not be extended and developed.</p>\r\n<p>In 2008, an opportunity to purchase modern dyeing works in the nearby town of Konstanty arose. That facility was equipped with modern equipment and had a large production premises. Waldemar Biliński bought out these dye works (with a large share of Danish capital), and acquired its employees. As a result of the merger of the production plants (departments) the current Zakład Wł&oacute;kienniczy Biliński Sp. Jawna (general partnership) was established.</p>\r\n<p>Both production departments that provided the production base to establish and run the present Zakład Wł&oacute;kienniczy Biliński Sp. Jawna dealt with services involving the dyeing and finishing of knitwear and fabrics. This profile of production and services has been maintained until now (2012). Currently the company provides complex servi es of dyeing and finishing fabrics, selling 23% on the domestic market, 50% on the local market and the remaining 27% in foreign markets. The company specialises in the finishing of various types of knitwear and fabrics. At present, it provides a very diverse technological profile, including dyeing, bleaching, cleaning, tumble drying, trimming, napping and other operations involving processing textiles made of cotton, viscose, linen and wool fibres, and their mixtures, as well as technical products made of aramid fibres.</p>\r\n<p>The main factors that according to the present owner constituted triggers for restructuring include the desire to improve the company&rsquo;s competitiveness and the owner&rsquo;s wish to upgrade technology and production, which facilitated the provision of new and top quality services to customers cooperating with the company.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>2008 is considered as the beginning of key changes in the business restructuring. That was when the restructuring process followed the following course:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>In 2008, the Farbolux&ndash;Biliński company (today Zakład Wł&oacute;kienniczy Biliński Sp. Jawna) moved to new production premises, which enabled them to develop the plants and invest in the field of environmental protection, including the recycling of production waste, industrial sewage treatment, etc. The production space increased four times. In autumn 2008, the production was transferred to modern production buildings which were adapted to new types of operations.</li>\r\n<li>New and continuously developed production departments started operations, providing new types of production services, particularly in the field of knitwear finishing, cleaning, napping, trimming, digital printing of fabrics, etc.</li>\r\n<li>State-of-the-art and digitally controlled production equipment was purchased.</li>\r\n<li>In consultation with the Technical University of L&oacute;dz, a laboratory to deliver research and technical services, including analyses of industrial sewage began operations.</li>\r\n<li>The owners were worried that the Polish market for production services was too narrow after it had increased its production capacity, especially since the company was now able to provide technologically highly advanced services. That knowledge stimulated them to search for and initiate commercial contacts with foreign enterprises, and the new technology facilitated their expansion on foreign markets. Exports to the following new foreign markets began: Scandinavian countries, Belarus, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.</li>\r\n<li>The size and structure of employment was significantly changed. The number of staff was reduced to 200 persons (following the merger of the two production departments) acquired together with the purchased company to the current level (178 persons in 2011), maintaining the same sales volume due to modernisation and purchase of modern machinery, which improved work efficiency. The staff&rsquo;s vocational and qualification-related structure was also significantly changed in terms of expertise. Currently the crew is composed of: 25% of employees with university degrees (engineers specialising in chemistry and mechatronics, etc. in particular), 50% of employees with secondary and basic vocational education, and 25% of employees with elementary education.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>All the restructuring-related measures were delivered by the owners based on multi-year plans, which were discussed with the Council of Employees and in production meetings with highly educated and specialised technical staff of the company.</p>\r\n<p>Employees were informed of plans concerning the start-up of the new types of operations and organisational changes in daily production (technical) meetings. In the case of the purchase of new equipment, the manufacturers organise relevant training in their respective countries or in Poland. The plant also organises its own internal training. Apart from daily technical meetings, given the lack of trade unions, employees take part in the business management process through their elected Council of Employees composed of seven members. The scope of the Council&rsquo;s operations and its functions are provided for in the Council Rules of Procedure. It performs the function of an advisory body in the process of planning the use of funds, including social funds.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring plans involved moving the production facility from L&oacute;dz to the production site purchased in Konstantynow (distance of around 30 km), and they were developed in detail as moving machinery and production could not interfere with continuity of delivery of production orders, otherwise the company would be at risk of losing its customers.</p>\r\n<p>The main sources of financing for the development of production and investment purchases included the company&rsquo;s own income and bank credit of a total value of &euro;2,302,277 in 2008. In 2012, the company received state aid (under the EU Structural Funds) amounting to &euro;153,846,00. That funding was spent exclusively on the purchase of a state-of-the-art digital printer.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The owner listed the following key problems that occurred during planning and implementation of the restructuring:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Long waiting time for the decisions on granting Structural Funds aid, and</li>\r\n<li>Problems of untimely payment of amounts due for services rendered to domestic companies as well as some companies from Belarus and Norway.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Apart from the Structural Funds used for the purchase of the digital printer, which will facilitate the provision of other types of services and open up new markets, the company did not receive any other external assistance. Any legal, financial and other services used by the company (lawyers, tax consultants, IT and mechatronics specialists) were subcontracted to commercial entities with whom the company had already had long-term cooperation. They were paid for with the company&rsquo;s own income.</p>\r\n<h3>Outcome of the restructuring</h3>\r\n<p>The restructuring process started in 2008 was implemented throughout that period up to 2012. The plan to shift location and replace the existing machinery and equipment with new and technologically highly advanced assets with high efficiency was continued. New types of production services were launched.</p>\r\n<p>The outcomes of the restructuring that have been accomplished so far, apart from increasing assets of the company and its owners, include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A significant increase in production capacity and modernising of production, which significantly extended the scale of operations. Also, the development of contacts, including contacts with foreign suppliers of materials and semi-products, and buyers of finished products.</li>\r\n<li>Enhanced qualifications of staff and competence of the technical supervision, due to such factors as training courses organised by the company, which were necessary in connection with the purchase and launch of new and more modern machinery and equipment, as well training delivered foreign companies regarding manufacturing machinery and equipment purchased from foreign manufacturers, and then installed and launched by the staff of the selling entity.</li>\r\n<li>Significant improvement of working conditions resulting from moving the company to new and well-equipped production buildings, the use of a modern production infrastructure, and elimination of<strong> </strong> harmfulness of the production to the environment accomplished also due to changes in some types of manufacturing activities involving the change of chemical processing into mechanical. In terms of safety at work and working conditions, the separation of the &lsquo;wet&rsquo; processing related to dyeing from the &lsquo;dry&rsquo; mechanical one, is more favourable for staff.</li>\r\n<li>Higher income earned by staff.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The measures implemented significantly contributed to the current high image of this company. Efforts undertaken by the owners were acknowledged through the award of numerous prizes. The company received the following certificates: Eurocertificate of Corporate Reliability and a range of quality certificates (ISO 2001, 2003). The owner was awarded the title of Textile Leader 2007, Professional Manager of Ł&oacute;dzkie Province, among others.</p>\r\n<p>The direct restructuring outcomes for the company&rsquo;s employees included a pay rise, maintaining a similar employment levels following acquisition of the plant in Konstantynow in 2008, improved staff competence and qualification levels, and maintaining forms of employment favourable to staff: indefinite contracts of employment, although the work is performed under a three-shift system, which is necessary due to the nature of the production process.</p>\r\n<p>From the start of the restructuring measures, major changes in the field of sales, employment and capital purchases took place. They were accompanied by significant changes in the levels of staff salary, which are now higher than the average salary level in the overall textiles industry. These changes are presented in the following table:</p>\r\n<table summary="""" border=""1""><colgroup> <col width=""23.30%"" /> <col width=""18.30%"" /> <col width=""20.10%"" /> <col width=""19.70%"" /> <col width=""18.10%"" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>in &euro;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>in &euro;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>in &euro;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(persons)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>remuneration in &euro;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>807.00813.00847.00864.00</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Staff reactions to the restructuring were different, depending on their years of service and positions. However, there was some resistance to the modernisation of production and the installation of new machinery and equipment in particular, fuelled by the fear of losing one&rsquo;s job, the need for more education and learning how to operate more complex machinery and equipment. In the later period, the staff attitude changed as a result of active awareness-raising measures implemented by the owners and management, which encouraged the staff to identify themselves better with their company. Consequently, efficiency was improved and production flexibility was also greater, due to the need to enter new markets.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately some 10% of employees were unable to learn how to operate more modern machinery and to adjust to new production processes. Accordingly, those employees either terminated their employment contracts themselves or were dismissed by the company. Some employees opted to end their employment contracts due to the difficulty and time needed to get from L&oacute;dz to the new facility, which was located much further from their place of residence.</p>\r\n<p>New plans concerning business development involve:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>development of the plant and launching a new department (the first one in Poland) for digital printer and cooperating appliances;</li>\r\n<li>recruiting new and highly educated employees;</li>\r\n<li>raising the qualifications of the current staff through, for example, training abroad (Italy or Japan).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The owner is of the opinion that the restructuring process was implemented according to the plan that was enforced by developing the appropriate documentation (business plans) required both by the banks in order to receive credits and the institutions which awarded the EU grants.</p>\r\n<h3>Commentary</h3>\r\n<p>According to the owner, the experience has taught him many lessons, including the differences between restructuring carried out in SMEs and in large companies:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is much easier to eliminate personal conflicts in SMEs. As a result of more direct contact with employees, it is also relatively easier to get rid of employee resistance to change and obtain acceptance for such changes.</li>\r\n<li>There is a shorter path of towards implementing changes and time for their delivery.</li>\r\n<li>Less bureaucratic burden in the process of application development and fund management.</li>\r\n<li>Lack of trade unions and supervisory boards in SMEs in comparison to large enterprises.</li>\r\n<li>Disadvantages include lower credit capacity in SMEs. They also lack their own specialists, including the ones specialising in developing of materials and documentation necessary to obtain external funding. As a result, persons from external organisations have to be hired, which results in increased costs incurred.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The key recommendations regarding public support include the need for assistance in planning and technological know-how transfer as well as development of various forms of consultations in this field. SMEs are left alone to search for such knowledge. The interviewee stated that communication and contacts with the company&rsquo;s staff are of top importance. At first, they are not pleasant, however with time, staff awareness concerning the plans is exceptionally useful in the process of changes. All efforts should be taken in order to convince people about such changes.</p>\r\n<p>An employee who was interviewed on the subject also positively assessed the changes implemented at the Zakład Wł&oacute;kienniczy Biliński company. A 52 year old mechanic with 30 years of service, he had worked at the Farbolux&ndash;Bilinski fabric dye-works for 15 years (prior to that he had worked in a large state-owned enterprise). He had no comments or reservations in regard to the planning and restructuring of the company. He emphasised that as a result of restructuring the company did not lose its customers and their number is growing. He stated that the benefits in the case of a smaller company, in comparison to a large one, mainly include better communication and smoother relations among staff, management and company owner.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Piasecki, University of Ł&oacute;dz</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Co-owner and chairman and an employee of Zakład Wł&oacute;kienniczy Biliński Sp.

"Biofun, Portugal"~"Biofun Biológicos do Fundao"~"<p>Biofun is a Portuguese producer of concentrates and flavourings from apple, pear, peach and strawberry, targeting national and European markets. Founded in 1996, the company employs 32 full-time workers. The current owners acquired the company in 2008 and decided to expand the business, remaining in close proximity to the raw materials, diversifying its product portfolio, adding four specialist staff and reaching new target markets. After the restructuring event, the company has experienced a growth in sales and activities, some of which are ongoing.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>	Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Founded in 1996 by a Chilean businessman, Biofun, a limited liability company, is a leading Portuguese producer of concentrates and flavourings from apple, pear, peach and strawberry (NACE 10320). The founder is no longer involved in the company since it was acquired by the two present owners, Marco Baptista and Miguel Machado.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, Biofun has a physical and industrial infrastructure near 4,000m<SUP>2</SUP> of covered area and about 100 hectares of land for agricultural production – located in Salgueiro, in the county of Fundão – and has 32 workers, reaching about 45 at the height of the fruit-harvesting season.</p>\r\n<p>Of these 32 workers, 75% are men and 25% are women, and only four have qualifications equal to university degree level, with the remaining workers having on average compulsory primary education. Employees at Biofun are not represented by a labour union or a works council.</p>\r\n<p>Among its main clients are the major industries producing cider (at European level) and juices, vinegar and fruit preparations (at national and European level). </p>\r\n<p>The company currently exports about 90% of its production, mainly to northern Europe, allocating the remaining 10% to the domestic market.</p>\r\n<p>The products that are produced in Biofun are 100% natural without any added preservatives or sugars, fulfilling all the requirements of the Code of Practice of the European Union.</p>\r\n<p>With a strong focus on quality, food safety and innovation as dynamic factors of competitiveness, Biofun has achieved the level of one of the most advanced international companies in the sector. </p>\r\n<p>It is a branch almost unique at the national level and highly specialised, which hinders the entry of competitors, using good-quality raw material, resulting in efficiencies and returns above normal, with quality and excellence recognised. </p>\r\n<p>After 2008, Biofun implemented a restructuring process that led to the expansion of the business, the diversification the product portfolio, an increase in target markets, and a strengthening of its internal team with two technical graduates in food chemistry and two industrial engineers. These new recruitments were made deliberately in order to develop new products and to penetrate new markets.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, Biofun has a storage capacity of 2,000 tons of concentrates and aromas, allowing for shorter delivery times. Production has been cyclical since the product is operated as a commodity, with between 2500 and 3500 tonnes per year (in 2012 it is expected to increase this figure because of a larger supply in terms of raw material, depending on the available raw material). </p>\r\n<p>The location of the company in this area of the country also ensures its central position for acquiring raw materials.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Background to restructuring event </h2>\r\n<p>Understanding the potential of the product segment has made Biofun a success story and an example of how strategic direction is a key factor for business success. </p>\r\n<p>This was the motive that led the current owners to acquire the company in 2008, a company that was threatened by obsolescence, weak innovation in terms of products and technologies, lack of qualified personnel and reduced sales levels. </p>\r\n<p>After 2009, the company achieved growth of 36% in sales, and an expansion in terms of the penetration of international markets (up to 2008 there was weak international penetration). Weak international penetration can be seen as a driver for restructuring and as a motivation for the current owners, combined with various characteristics of the business – access to raw materials, the quality of the raw materials, commercialisation channels opened but poorly explored – to acquire the firm and expand.</p>\r\n<p>When the current administrators of Biofun, Marco Baptista and Miguel Madeira – both graduate students from the University of Beira Interior (UBI) in Covilhã, and workers at the plant – thought about buying the business, they took into account three fundamental aspects, in terms of product and market positioning: what to commercialise; where to produce; and where to sell.</p>\r\n<p>The new owners had a notion of the risks involved, but had in their favour business knowledge (since they were already collaborating with the company) and the opportunity of getting loans from banks to finance the acquisition process and start the necessary procedures (investment in the qualifications of the personnel and in more effective equipment).</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the business turned out to be a good opportunity, as the manufacture of concentrated fruit juice was viewed as an excellent addition to the strong domestic fruit industry via a food processing industry, whereby a first processor transforms the raw material that is not sold on the fresh market. In addition, the new owners were already familiar with marketing routes and contacts, the business sector and the raw material suppliers.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the county of Fundão, in the heart of the Cova da Beira region, is one of the best fruit production regions in Portugal, and this can contribute to reducing the production and transportation costs of the raw materials that are incorporated into the process.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of destination market, the recognition by the new team that concentrated juice is a highly appreciated product worldwide proved a critical success factor.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Biofun was restructured with a new management team, starting in March 2008, aimed at expanding further in terms of supply (for example, product diversification), market penetration and internationalisation. The restructuring plan was developed by both of the new owners, prior to the acquisition while collaborating with the firm as employees and involved the acquisition process and the expansion process. It started in 2008 and is still ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>Following acquisition of the company, the new owners carry out a restructuring process of the internal organisation, providing specialised staff in order to meet the needs and opportunities identified for diversification of products and innovation at the product level, going beyond the production of concentrated apple and pear and apple products. </p>\r\n<p>Aware of the value added through their product, characterised by its uniqueness, the team implemented a strategy reflective of the future vision of the ‘new’ company: buy the best raw materials; invest in manufacturing and juice concentrates technological equipment; improve efficiency and internal organisation; implement a certified total quality system for food and safety, as well as management of research and development. In operational terms, the restructuring process involved finding new suppliers, investing in machinery and a chemical laboratory, recruiting qualified people to perform the technical and chemical analysis and control, diversifying products and searching for new clients at national and international level. In addition, the company is investing in the cultivation of raw materials with a treatment plant for water and waste.  </p>\r\n<p>The project development required a financial partnership in order to financially support the restructuring process leading to business expansion. The investment in the acquisition of the company and in new machinery and market development was financed using a credit line called ‘SME Invest’ from national funds, allowing for expansion into new markets in a sustainable way.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the role of workers, Biofun management considers them to be the ‘backbone’ of the company, to the extent that many of them have accumulated experience in the sector for over 20 years, coupled with strong training and competencies updated by the company over time. The workers were informed about the restructuring event before it started by the previous owner plus the new owners who were then workers. They were involved in the process since the beginning, through formal and informal meetings, specific training targeted at product diversification and certification, and the recruitment of additional labour which was also a sign of expansion and a means to improve worker commitment.</p>\r\n<p>The company expanded in terms of product portfolio, and new markets. In this vein, another instrument derived from the restructuring was the investment in specific certifications in the field of food chemistry in order to boost production with existing innovation parameters, quality and technology.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, Biofun is currently increasing its manufacturing capacity of new fruit concentrate, investing heavily in new technology and in strengthening its technical personnel and certified total quality management (e.g. ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 22.000:2005 ; and NP4457: 2007).</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the company is investing in product diversification: including fruits with hard stones and red fruits, aimed at to breaking the seasonal cycles imposed by its current core business, apples and pears.</p>\r\n<p>The focus on technology and innovation, (investing in new equipment and machinery and in certification and innovative products and sub products targeted at niche markets, such as the Jewish market, for instance) allowed the company to manufacture fruit juice concentrates from fruits with and without stones, as well as to re-use the flavours of used fruits.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The new owners reported various constraints related to implementing the restructuring process. First, getting funding to purchase the company, diversify production, expand the business and penetrate new markets, especially international ones. Secondly, the need to create skilled jobs and strengthen the technical and technological competences to meet the goals of the company. Thirdly, the human resources management is considered a critical issue, especially countering the aversion to change among older workers, so the strategy has been focused on acquiring skills in several areas, in order to transform the personnel into more flexible and prepared resources.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008, when the present administration undertook an MBO (Management Buy Out), the company subsidised this process with an application to SMEs Invests Line III of the National Strategic Reference Framework (QREN). As it was considered a project of special interest for the region, since it is a rural area with a special focus on agro-food businesses, the national framework recognised the importance of funding the company expansion. The owners acknowledged the investment line through contacts with a specialist funding consultant who has supported them in developing the proposal and managing the needed procedures to obtain the funding. In addition, they were supported by Caixa Geral de Depósitos, a public bank of which the company was already a client. The good performance of the bank in easing the access, in due time, to the financing credit was crucial for the commitment assumed, at that moment, with the Spanish market, thus increasing the Spanish involvement.</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the process was considered by the owners as being somehow bureaucratic. </p>\r\n<p>In the context of the financial crisis in international markets, the financial support allowed the company to address the difficulties, through external sources of finance and working capital, which enabled them to pursue the investments in progress and meet the commitments established with suppliers.</p>\r\n<p>For the support of SMEs invest, this resulted in a financing transaction designed for a specific line for exporters and small business sectors in order to strengthen the permanent capital to be applied in investment in fixed capital and working capital.</p>\r\n<p>Also as part of the QREN support, the Biofun had their funds approved in the Incentive System for Qualification and Internationalisation of SMEs, to strengthen penetration into new markets, with a project called BIOFUN – Qualification and Internationalisation 2014, with an amount of €192,261.22 – which aims firstly to leverage staff skills and increase the number of employees with the necessary skills, as well as increase the volume of exports by betting on the internationalisation process.</p>\r\n<p>To address the need to develop employee skills, the company got associated, in 2011, with the Cluster initiative named Agro-Industrial Center, which is covered by a grant from the QREN - Collective Efficiency Strategies.</p>\r\n<p>Also in 2011, Biofun had granted assistance from the Human Potential Operational Programme (POPH - QREN) for Training Innovation and Management of its qualified and semi-qualified workers in the amount of €67,107.20.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>It is important to highlight the specific results in terms of business (that is, increased competitiveness) as well as in terms of the workers. </p>\r\n<p>Following the restructuring process, the company wished to go further in terms of its diversification and product innovation. The concentrate was supplemented with fruits such as apples, pears, stone fruit (such as peaches) and, recently, red fruits. Besides the UK, the company found new destination markets in Germany, France and Spain, creating business opportunities in the Iberian and international markets.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to highlight the effects of supply diversification, the entry of the peach and experiences with carrots and strawberry concentrate. In fact, what varied most after the restructuration was the diversification of customers and the triumph over seasonality in terms of new products (strawberries, apples, pears, peaches and carrots).</p>\r\n<p>A complementary project is the plan to plant more than 300 acres of apple trees, and the first phase has already started with 85 acres of planting, with planned completion date in February or March 2013. Biofun has started the second phase to plant over 220 hectares in 2013. This project will be carried out in the county of Fundão, mainly in the parishes of Capinha and Salgueiro, and aims to create 60 jobs over and above the indirect and seasonal jobs for which 250 people will be needed.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of employees, the company was able to leverage their skills by implementing actions and specific training programmes and monitoring activities supported by the above-mentioned grants from QREN projects. </p>\r\n<p>In recent years, after the restructuring event, the company has experienced a growth in activities, currently holding a consolidated position in the market. </p>\r\n<p>There was also a positive effect on markets, much of the success of Biofun being due to exports: 80% of exports are to customers in the UK, Spain, Germany, Austria and Sweden. Thus, foreign customers ensure financial liquidity that reduces Biofun’s dependence on debt – that is, the dependence on external finance borrowed from the bank.</p>\r\n<p>Since 2009, sales have increased by 36%, reaching €4.5 million in 2011. As results, Biofun is now investing its own capital in agricultural production, but on a more industrialised scale, to produce raw materials to transform in the plant.</p>\r\n<p>Besides the new strawberry concentrate, the company embarked on new market niches, notably production begun in 2011l for the Jewish market. Biofun obtained Kosher certification (also a restructuring instrument), granted by the Portugal Kosher and International Orthodox Union, which ensures that the products follow the certification process for concentrates and can be used to make juices and other products for consumption by Jews who follow strict food hygiene guidelines. Hence, the unit can start supplying German market niches and enter the Israeli Jewish and American markets.</p>\r\n<p>These restructuring events enabled the company to have the strength and working capital necessary to meet the current constraints caused by the international crisis and, in particular, the national crisis. </p>\r\n<p>Market diversification, in terms of international clients and the increase in export share and turnover, enables Biofun to expand investments in infrastructure projects, and the carry out the necessary training and qualification of its employees. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The change in ownership was a major intervention which enabled the company to undertake a reorientation strategy aimed at expanding its business areas and access new and diversified markets.</p>\r\n<p>Another key element in the process is the focus on innovation and diversification in terms of products (new products), obtaining the raw material (own new forms of production and the amount of raw material), and new niches (for example, capturing the market of Jewish products).</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, Biofun has been pursuing a continuous investment in human capital, by means of  programmes specifically targeted at restructuring and diversification.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the company has proved its innovation and quality by strengthening the technical staff and getting certification from international standardised norms of total quality management, such as the ISO 9001:2000, the ISO 22.000:2005, and the NP4457: 2007.</p>\r\n<p><b>	Authors</b></p>\r\n<p>Dina Pereira, UBI and João Leitão, UBI, IPP and CEG-IST</p>\r\n<p><b>	Information sources</b></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>	Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Marco Baptista, CEO and Andreia Gil, Lab Manager</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>	Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Biofun – Produtos Biológicos do Fundão, Lda.</p>\r\n<p>Estrada Nacional 346 - km 21, </p>\r\n<p>Quinta Ferreira de Baixo</p>\r\n<p>6230-610 Salgueiro-Fundão</p>\r\n<p>Portugal</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>	Company website</h3>\r\n<p> www.biofun.pt</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>	Secondary sources </h3>\r\n<p>Einforma (2009), <i>Report on technological capabilities of firms in Cova da Beira region</i>.</p>\r\n<p>University of Beira Interior (2012), <i>Diagnosis report: Gap analysis of BIOFUN – Produtos Biológicos do Fundão.</i></p>\r\n<p>Jornal do Fundão, Jornal Diário de Notícias, Caixa Empresas, Maio 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Portugal"~"10 - manufacture of food products"~"10-49"~"10-49"~NULL~"business expansion"~"2012-09-01"
"CAM, Italy"~"CAM"~"<p>CAM, a manufacturer of hydraulic and pneumatic components, started to lose orders as many of its clients began internalising activities that they had been outsourcing to CAM. As production fell, the company launched a restructuring process, one highly dependent on state income support to compensate staff for their reduced working hours. In the meantime, the company launched the development of a new product, investing its own funds in product development, and in training employees in its manufacture. Developed through ongoing social dialogue, the restructuring meant that the company was able to maintain the level of employment and to develop a new product, one that attracted orders before development was finished.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>CAM is a crafts company mainly engaged in hydraulic and pneumatic components manufacturing, in particular the manufacture of components for the hydroelectric and hydrothermal manufacturing sectors. The company was founded on 14 February 1990, when the owner was only 17 years of age, and its main activity was to operate as a process manufacturer in the fittings manufacturing sector. The business idea was somewhat inspired by the owner&rsquo;s father, who in 1957, while working as a manger for a company, decided to establish an assembly company to provide assembling services for the company he was employed in. When the owner decided to establish its activity, his father had already decided to retire and close his business. CAM&rsquo;s owner opted to give 5% of ownership to his father.</p>\r\n<p>Ownership and management are concentrated and the company is run as a family business.</p>\r\n<p>At the beginning, the company operated in the fittings sector, and then came to specialise as a process manufacturer in the hydraulic fitting sector. At the present time, the company still supplies assembling services for other companies operating in the hydrothermal sector; however, CAM is in the process of developing a flow measurement fitting, and it aims in the near future to specialise in the manufacture of flow measurement fittings.</p>\r\n<p>The company started in 1990 with three employees, and by the end of the year had seven employees. Between 1997 and 2002 the company hired a further 12 employees, making a total of 19 employees, which has since then remained unchanged.</p>\r\n<p>The 19 employees are aged between 30 and 45, with 17 female and two male employees &ndash; one in quality control and the other in the technical department. All members of staff are employed on a permanent contract. The company has also availed of four external consultants, who are mainly technicians involved in assembling.</p>\r\n<p>There is no work council within the company. However, when the company had to implement a first restructuring process in 2007 and benefit from social shock absorbers, the agreement and social dialogue as prescribed by Italian Law was done with the CGIL trade union.</p>\r\n<p>The company is located in a very small village and it is highly embedded in the local community. All employees live a maximum 10 to 15 km from the site of the company and the owner, originally from the village of Mura, now lives only 30 km away.</p>\r\n<p>The company does not have a written human resources strategy. Human resources management is administered internally to the company by the owner/manager. However, with future prospects of business expansion in the flow measurement fittings manufacturing sector, the owner foresees that a human resources department and a written human resources strategy and development strategy will have to be established and developed.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>The activity grew continuously until 2007, the company working with three main clients until then, with an additional two clients in periods of high demand. It enjoyed an average turnover of up to &euro;3 billion per year (of which &euro;2 billion from business with one specific client).</p>\r\n<p>However in 2007, due to economic difficulties, the company started to lose most of its orders, as many of its clients started to internalise those activities that were outsourced up to then. Furthermore one of CAM&rsquo;s main client, which owed CAM &euro;270,000, was declared bankrupt, and CAM lost the amount it was owed. At that particular time, the company had also financed the construction of a new site which had cost &euro;1.800,000. The loss of the money owed from the bankrupt client and the high costs of the new productive site resulted in very difficult economic conditions, forcing the company to implement a restructuring process.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Small companies operating in crafts sector do not have the same access to social shock absorbers as larger companies in industry. However, these crafts companies can also benefit from the support of bilateral bodies, which are jointly managed by social partners, and which pay specific subsidies, as part of the unemployment benefit, to workers in the event of a reduction in working hours or suspension, from the contribution of the Employment Fund managed by the Italian Ministry of Labour and Social Policies (see also Eurofound, 2010)</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, at the beginning of the restructuring process, the management got the support of the bilateral body for arts and crafts (EBNA &ndash; <em>ente bilaterale nazionale artigianato</em>) which provided income support to the 17 female employees while production was temporarily stopped for three months. However, after these three months, and due to the increasing demand for support to the bilateral bodies caused by the economic crisis, these bodies were unable to provide support to all its members and the company implemented restructuring via the support of the ordinary wage guarantee fund ( CIGO &ndash; <em>cassa integrazione ordinaria</em> CIGO, see also Eurofound, 2010). Under this arrangement on a rotation base three to four employees at a time among the 17 female employees, were not working, while receiving a 80% of their normal salary (<em>cassa integrazione guadagni ordinaria a zero ore</em>). The two male staff, employed in the quality control and technical department, due to their occupational tasks were not affected by the restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, in 2008, due to a decrease in turnover of more than 65%, at times the entire production was temporarily stopped and all of the 17 female employees benefited from the CIGO and from the extraordinary wage guarantee fund (CIGS<em> &ndash; cassa integrazione straordinaria</em> see also Eurofound, 2010), which envisaged the stop of production (<em>CIGS zero ore</em>). Under this scheme employees work reduced hours up to zero hours worked, while receiving income support equal to 80% of their last salary.</p>\r\n<p>Due to persisting negative developments, in 2011 the company continued the <em>CIGS zero ore</em> for seven of the 17 employees, meaning that on a rotation base seven employees would not work at all for a specific period of time &ndash; three months in this restructuring case &ndash; while receiving CIGS income support, while for the remaining ten employees the company introduced a solidarity contract (<em>contratto di solidariet&agrave;</em>, see also Eurofound, 2010), a social shock absorber which provides for short-time working of equal measure for the whole workforce, while employees benefit of income support. In this specific case, the ten affected employees reduced working hours, but production was not been stopped.</p>\r\n<p>However, during the three months when they were not working and benefiting from CIGS, the seven employees were engaged in training courses organised by the trade union CGIL. In this specific case the seven employees attended a training course on ICT.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, since 2007, the manager started to develop a new idea to launch a new product on the market: a flow measurement fitting. After analysing and assessing in detail the hydrothermal market, management realised there was a vacuum in this sector. Indeed, such product was developed in Europe by one only company which had a monopoly in the entire market. The management of CAM noted that this Swiss company produced only flow measurement fittings which were standard and for this reason each client had to adjust these for their products. CAM started to research and study a method to develop a flow measurement fitting which can work with a universal adaptor. In 2011, the company registered their industrial design for their own flow measurement fitting which is enabled with a universal adaptor. In this way, CAM&rsquo;s flow measurement fittings can be installed on any hydrothermal product.</p>\r\n<p>CAM planned to launch their brand new flow measurement fitting in February 2012, with an investment of &euro;400,000. The company will produce the fitting, while the molding of the specific fitting will be outsourced to a partner company operating in the thermal manufacturing sector, a former client of CAM. This partner company had outsourced the production of flow measurement fittings in China; however, due to the unsatisfactory quality of the production outsourced it became interested in CAM&rsquo;s idea and decided to invest in it. The costs of the molding activity will be borne on a 50% base by CAM and by the partner company. The partner company has also the technical capacity in-house to provide technical consultancy for the development of the new product.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the development on this new product, the company has implemented extensive training for its staff on a solidarity contract in order to train them for this new production. In particular, four of these ten employees are attending a training course on quality control, organised by an external provider.</p>\r\n<p>The CIGS will last until the end of December 2011, however as the production for the new product will start only in February 2012, the management believes that CIGS will be renewed at least for the first quarter of 2012, and once the new production has started, they will assess how the market is responding to this new product and they will then re-assess the situation of the company in light of the outcome of the new production, and the relevant steps will be then taken.</p>\r\n<p>The company has already received requests for their own flow measurement fittings, therefore future prospects seem positive. Indeed, the partner company has already ordered 250 flow measurement fittings.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenges the company encountered related to the great uncertainty regarding the prospect of orders from clients. This implied a high degree of uncertainty on how to manage the restructuring process as well as high costs incurred both for financing and developing the new product (also including training costs) &ndash; which has been all private capital of the owner and then private money of the partner company who invested in the molding activity of the new flow measurement fitting &ndash; and for anticipating the income support treatments from the Italian National Social Security Institute (INPS).</p>\r\n<p>In fact, despite the fact that the restructuring was financed by the social shock absorbers (this is financed via a contribution that each enterprise pays, in a sort of insurance mechanism), the procedure requires that the income support is anticipated by the company, which will then be reimbursed by INPS. This reimbursement, however, can be paid several months after the treatment. This can result in a large burden for companies which are already in difficult situations. In the specific case, by July 2009 the company had anticipated &euro;200,000 of income support.</p>\r\n<p>The employees were informed immediately via the manager of the necessity to implement restructuring. However, given the limited size of the company, and the high level of trust, loyalty and even friendship between the employees and the employer, all employees were quite positive during the restructuring. While at the beginning the events were received with some feelings of worry and uncertainty, these have diminished during the ongoing process, as the company showed a sincere interest in its employees and future prospects seems quite positive thanks to the development of the new product.</p>\r\n<p>The manager started the company when he was only 17 years age, and therefore CAM represents his lifetime project. The manager is also very fond of his employees, and even if the impact on wages has not been dramatic, thanks to the supply of the social shock absorber, the decision to result to this tool has been emotionally very difficult.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company has been supported in its restructuring process by the bilateral body EBNA, which provided advice and information especially on the social shock absorbers, its procedures and the social dialogue with the other involved actors. Indeed, the restructuring processes and the different options were discussed with EBNA which provided valuable advice.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the company stresses that social dialogue has been very fair, and the CGIL trade union has been extremely fair and supportive to the company as well as the employees. All decisions have been the result of an agreement between the trade union, the employees and the company.</p>\r\n<p>An external company, which is also financing 50% of the costs of the molding activity of the new flow measurement fitting, provided the technical consultancy for the development of this new product.</p>\r\n<p>The company benefited from the economic support provided by the social shock absorbers which, however, are based on an insurance mechanism and are therefore financed by companies. According to the company, this support has proved vital to the survival of the company during times of uncertainty.</p>\r\n<p>However, the additional economic support to finance the restructuring in terms of costs for the specific training for the four employees for the new flow measurement fitting designed by CAM have been entirely borne by the company. It must be highlighted that the company regarded the training as very satisfactory and deemed it indispensable for a fruitful development of its activities.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring had a positive outcome, as it enabled the company to face the decline in orders, turnover and profits due to the economic crisis and it has also enabled the company to develop its own new product which might help it to expand his business.</p>\r\n<p>All the social shock absorbers implemented have proved to be indispensable in order to implement the necessary employment adjustments, while safeguarding the employment levels.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was continuously developed, through ongoing social dialogue based on the specific economic contingencies of the company. This implies that the company assessed the different restructuring tools on offer, it implemented those which seemed the most appropriate and it re-assessed them according to the market reactions. In any event, the restructuring reached the intended outcomes, as the company was able to maintain the level of employment and even to develop a new product.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring also impacted on the management, in monetary terms as he invested a lot of personal resources in the process, but most importantly in terms of personal effects, such as stress, insecurity, fear of having to close the company. However, the owner firmly believes and stands behind the reasons for restructuring, as after assessing all viable options, he agreed that the specific restructuring implemented was the only feasible process which would have guaranteed the survival of the company. This choice has been excruciating at times but essential. In particular, recent developments show that these difficult decisions were well worth taking as first reactions to the new product developed are quite positive.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of staff, even when out of working all employees affected by the restructuring have been engaged in different training courses, even considering the slight decrease in wages foreseen by the social shock absorbers, outcomes on staff can be considered somehow positive.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process has not been formally evaluated, neither internally or externally. However, the company strongly argues that, notwithstanding the associated difficulties, the restructuring process has been positive. CAM is also very positive on the future outlook of the company and is very confident on its new flow measurement product.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring event was deemed positive by the company, which has declared it would implement the exact same restructuring process if it could go back in time, but it would implement it quicker. Indeed, the support of the social shock absorbers were deemed essential to implement the restructuring and to provide for the company survival during uncertain times.</p>\r\n<p>The company also declared that the support of EBNA and in particular the positive and fruitful social dialogue with CGIL which resulted in the restructuring agreement, have been positively contributing to the successful outcome of the restructuring. The fair process of social dialogue, as well as the loyalty and trust between the employees and employer, has also encouraged a calm and polite environment within the company and in the relations with the management. Indeed while at the beginning affected employees were understandably worried about their uncertain prospects, with time they have understood and supported the reasons for restructuring. According to the company the supportive behavior of CIGL was essential to ensure a smooth restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>CAM stressed also that the great uncertainty on the outlook of orders received by clients resulted in a high degree of uncertainty on how to manage the restructuring process. Furthermore, the high costs incurred both for financing and developing the new product (also including training costs) and for anticipating the income support treatments from INPS imposes a burden on companies needing to implement process of restructuring. This is particularly negative, as it affects companies already negatively affected by difficult economic conditions. This is of great concern for SMEs, which generally face more constrains to capital access than their larger counterparts, due to size concerns. This is even more dramatic during times of crisis, when funding opportunities are extremely limited.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Lidia Salvatore, Eurofound</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<h3>Interview</h3>\r\n<p>Angelo Crescini owner and manager of CAM di Crescini Achille &amp; C.</p>\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.cam-crescini.it/"">http://www.cam-crescini.it/</a></p>\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3>\r\n<p>Eurofound (2010), <em>Italy: Wage guarantee fund, solidarity agreements, bilateral bodies and wage guarantee fund in derogation</em>, available at <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef10636.htm"">http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef10636.htm</a></p>"~"Italy"~"28 - manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c."~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2011-11-28"
"Cinoco Group, Belgium"~"Cinoco Group"~"<p>Belgian drinks company Cinoco group acquired a competing company, Le Palais du Vin, in a business expansion. Potential synergies were identified between the two companies, mostly in the back office operations – accounting, financial services and IT services. Insofar as confidentiality permitted, all concerned parties were kept informed of developments – employees through regular internal information meetings; partners, clients and suppliers, individual letters. Concerted efforts were made to create a common culture for the two companies – a challenge, given that both were long-established. No staff were laid off, any reduction in head count coming from retirements and one resignation. Remuneration was left untouched for both companies.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Background information on the company</h3>\r\n<p>The C.I. Nolet &amp; Co. Group (Cinoco Group) is a family business originating in 1691, the date of the foundation of the Nolet distillery in Schiedam, the Netherlands. In the 19th century, Charles-Hubert Nolet de Brauwere, the family member in charge of the distillery, moved to Belgium where a part of the Nolet de Brauwere family settled. His son, Charles Nolet, extended the activities of the distillery to the distribution and representation of French wines and champagnes in the early part of the 20th century. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the Cinoco S.A. company was incorporated in Brussels (1958). </p>\r\n<p>Today, the Cinoco Group owns five companies: Cinoco S.A., Le Palais du Vin S.A., Bodega, FX de Beukelaer and a Luxembourg subsidiary, Maxivins Lux. The consolidated turnover of the Cinoco Group is, on average, around €32 Mio. The current total number of employees is 60. The two most important entities of the group, Cinoco S.A. and the Palais du Vin S.A., are two separate companies, with two different names and having two separate and independent sales and marketing departments. This dual legal entity is due to the specificities of the industry: it is not allowed to put competing brands under the same flag. Synergies occur mainly at the level of back office.  </p>\r\n<p>The Cinoco Group is active in the sector of wines and spirits wholesale trade, with a focus on distribution in Belgium. Cinoco offers to the market <i>Grands Crus</i> and other brands of wine, spirits and liquors as well as supporting services. 95% of the clients are based in Belgium, including specialists, wholesalers, the hotel and restaurants sector, supermarkets, catering and other companies and private persons. Over the last three years, the turnover more than doubled: rising from €15 to €32 Mio. </p>\r\n<p>In 2004, Gilles Nolet de Brauwere van Steeland (tenth generation) takes over the general management of Cinoco Group. Mr Nolet had prior professional experience as a Business and Development Director – hence in restructuring – in international large companies. Back then, the company had around 40 employees and a turnover of around €150 Mio. In 2008, Cinoco S.A. bought Le Palais du Vin S.A. for a price of €14 Mio, which is the restructuring event for the purpose of this case study. This acquisition almost doubled the size of the company and its turnover.  </p>\r\n<p>The average age of employees is 46 years old. A few employees keep on working (on special arrangement) after retirement. Women account for only 18% of all employees. Around ten persons have a university degree, including a couple with a master’s degree. Around 20% of workers have a vocational training diploma. The rest of the workforce has no higher degree, in some cases no degree at all. A third of employees are blue-collar workers. </p>\r\n<p>The Nolet de Brauwere family owns 65% of the group. The French family company Bollinger owns 10% of the group while French group Marie Brizard (MB) owns 25%. It should be noted that MB purchased its share in Cinoco Group in 1995 when MB still qualified as a family-owned company: as Marie Brizard has a 25% share in Cinoco Group, the two companies must be considered as partner enterprises. Therefore 25% of Marie Brizard’s turnover (which is around € 300 Mio a year) should be added to that of the Cinoco Group to calculate the company’s group as defined under Recommendation of 5 May 2005. </p>\r\n<p>This means that, theoretically and legally, the Cinoco Group does not qualify as an SME, while the family holds owns 65% of the shares and has four out of six seats at the Board of Directors. </p>\r\n<p>Half of the family holding is controlled by Mr Nolet and the other half by his older brother – who is also the manager of liqueur company FX de Beukelaer. Mr Nolet and his brother have regular conversations on general management matters, but neither brother interferes in the management matters of each other. </p>\r\n<p>Finally, there is no works council at Cinoco Group as legal thresholds for a works council obligation within Cinoco S.A. and within Le Palais du Vin S.A. are not met.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Background information on interviewees</h3>\r\n<p>The educational and professional background of Mr Gilles Nolet de Brauwere is interesting as it certainly had an impact on the restructuring event itself and on how it was carried out (as shown below). </p>\r\n<p>Mr Nolet has two university degrees that he obtained in parallel: a degree in law and a degree in economic sciences. While he has never practiced as a lawyer, his knowledge of the law allows him to understand and master legal issues companies commonly face, including when restructuring (legal structure of financial relationship with banks, legal framework applicable to mergers and acquisitions, and so on). </p>\r\n<p>Mr Nolet’s main professional experience before joining the Cinoco Group is in IT, finance, general management and in business and development, including several positions as Business and Development Director, thus in mergers and acquisitions, which is the precise nature of the restructuring in the present case study. Mr Nolet has almost ten years of international professional experience abroad, including in Germany (Frankfurt and Hamburg) and in London. He also has some experience in the banking and finance sector, as Business Development Director for a subsidiary of the Deutsche Bank Group, ALD GmbH, in Hamburg. </p>\r\n<p>Besides his law degree, Mr Nolet has additional degrees/diplomas: an Executive Masters in Management from the Solvay-ULB Management School of Brussels, a diploma in Finance Management from the Vlaamse economische Hogeschool Brussels, and a diploma in company law from the Vrij Universiteit Brussels. </p>\r\n<p>The interviewed employee, Fanny Vigneron, is 34 years old. She has been working for the Cinoco Group for over three years and a half, as Customer Services Manager. Beforehand, she worked in a large company active in the transport sector. She is a graduate in law and literature. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The type of restructuring event is the acquisition of a competing company, Le Palais du Vin, which at the same time, corresponds to a business expansion. Mr Nolet identified several triggers to this event, including: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Personal preferences resulting from his background in\r\nfinances and in business development, including his personal vision, his own\r\nopenness to identify and grab such an opportunity<i>, </i> and his own passion\r\nto accomplish the restructuring process; </li>\r\n<li>to expand externally by doubling the company size;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>The ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ aspect of the\r\ntransaction, resulting essentially from the fact that the acquired company was\r\nlocated close to the seat of Cinoco S.A. and from the fact that the premises of\r\nCinoco S.A. were sufficiently large to accommodate Le Palais du Vin’s own\r\nstock. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process went from the end of 2007 until the end of 2009 and beyond, and includes the following steps: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>November 2007: management  was informed of the bid to\r\nacquire Le Palais du Vin and focused its attention on this specific issue.\r\nCinoco then issued a letter of intent; </li>\r\n<li>From January 2008: negotiations with counterparties and\r\nbanks, which, according to Mr Nolet, went quite well (due to the excellent\r\nreputation of the company and of Mr Nolet and the excellent track records of\r\nCinoco Group for the years 2004–2008); </li>\r\n<li>July 2008: finalisation of the transaction; </li>\r\n<li>Early 2009: arrival of Fanny Vigneron, external to both\r\ncompanies, as an employee responsible for customer services, notably in charge\r\nof integrating activities; </li>\r\n<li>February 2009: arrival of La Maison du Vin’s\r\nemployees at Cinoco’s premises; </li>\r\n<li>From May 2009: launch of integration process.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Mr Nolet explains that the restructuring process followed a well-defined structure. First, Mr Nolet started to openly look for external growth. When the opportunity arose, the negotiation process followed a structure that is commonly followed in merger and acquisition processes (letter of intent, due diligence, parallel negotiations with banks, etc.). Mr Nolet’s own international experience proved very useful to carry out such a process, notably with respect to the identification of potential synergies between the two companies. Synergies occurred mostly at the level of back-up office, namely accounting, financial services and IT services. In this respect, Ms Vigneron explained that the synergies between the two IT system was a delicate and important issue that took months to be completed. One facilitating factor for this completion was the fact that both companies used the same IT system, albeit at different level of implementation. The merger of the system resulted in increased efficiency/return. </p>\r\n<p>External and internal communication was also structured. The management was transparent towards employees as soon as confidentiality of negotiations was alleviated, notably by organising internal information meetings on a regular basis. Communication with partners, clients and suppliers occurred after confidentiality of the transaction was levied, by way of a few press releases and, most importantly according to Mr Nolet, by way of individual letters addressed to each external party, cosigned by Cinoco and Le Palais du Vin.  </p>\r\n<p>No social negotiations took place during the process due to the absence of a work council. Numerous legal obligations applicable to transfer of activities (<i>transfert de branche d’activité</i>) under Belgian company law had to be followed, such as announcements and letters to all employees, for example (or the announcement of the transaction in the <i>Belgian Gazette, </i> for example). This was well done through an open and transparent communication to all workers of both companies right from the start. This direct and open communication played a positive role in the restructuring process. </p>\r\n<p>Ms Vigneron joined the group at a critical point during the restructuring process. She was chosen for the position as she was neutral towards both companies. One of her mission regarding the restructuring process was to ‘erase borders’ between the two companies, to make sure employees from both sides developed a common company culture. As both companies were ‘old’ companies with established and long-lasting reputation, this was seen as a challenge back then. She was deeply involved in managing human resources and teams during the acquisition deployment, so she was in a position to report on the impact of the acquisition on the workforce. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Nolet insisted that the small size of the firm facilitated the whole process: the small size allowed for a rapid gathering of company-related information when needed as well as a rapid diffusion of information. The absence of strict and formal reporting lines – besides reporting to the Board of Directors of course, is viewed as a facilitating factor. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Overall, Mr Nolet believes the restructuring process went well. He does not report any specific issue, beside the elements that are SME-specific identified in this report. </p>\r\n<p>Ms Vigneron confirms that the restructuring process was well implemented; and that the management implemented change in a ‘delicate’ and humane way. The working atmosphere before and after restructuring was excellent and employees are highly motivated, according to her. She sees a positive factor between this and the productivity of the company, which she regards as being high. Today, employees have the feeling of working for a common cause and being part of the same family. The Managing Director, Mr Nolet, is well respected among the workforce. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support </h2>\r\n<p>The acquisition of Le Palais du Vin was done on the basis of own resources and on the basis of a loan, granted by two banks. The prior experience of Mr Nolet with business and development and with the financial and banking sector, as well as additional skills (such as negotiation skills), greatly contributed to the success of relationship with banks. The reputation of the company, that of the family and the personal and professional track record of Mr Nolet himself, including subsequent reputation, also contributed positively. Moreover, since his arrival at the top of the company in 2004, Mr Nolet had made a substantial work on improving the company’s financial situation, which also is viewed as a positive factor. </p>\r\n<p>It appears from the interview that the personal and professional skills of the Managing Director  greatly contributed to the success of the process. Mr Nolet was furthermore supported by two experts, one lawyer and one auditor, who are both close acquaintances of Mr Nolet. Thanks to these personal ties, Mr Nolet benefited from preferential fees. Mr Nolet explained that the rates of external experts (M&amp;A lawyers, financial counsels, etc.) are usually prohibitive for SMEs. He further stated that SMEs commonly lack the human and technical expertise for carrying out restructuring procedures. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of the restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The outcome of the restructuring is viewed as positive as it allowed for a substantial increase of the group’s turnover and workforce. The remuneration of the owners also increased, but Mr Nolet highlighted that, following conditions imposed by banks (mentioned above), the company dividends were reduced by a third. Mr Nolet views this as a specific feature of SMEs, which does not occur in larger ones. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring went according to the plan and was in line with Mr Nolet’s own experience of business development. </p>\r\n<p>As far as employees are concerned, they too benefited from the acquisition as new positions were defined, training was offered to those in need of it, and so on. The definition and the allocation of employee tasks was one of the specific mission allocated to Ms Vigneron: she had to work with every employee to identify and define work and assess where change could be implemented in order to benefit from synergies. </p>\r\n<p>Moreover, there was not a single lay-off. In the aftermath of the restructuring, there was a downward adjusting of ten working units, but these resulted from several retirements and one termination of function upon common agreement. Remuneration was left untouched for both companies. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>As mentioned above, Mr Nolet identifies numerous elements that are specific to SMEs when restructuring, some of which are positive, while others are negative, including: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Impact of personality and professional background of the\r\nManaging Director on the success and/or failure of restructuring processes;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Absence of social negotiations for those SMEs not\r\nfulfilling thresholds under social laws; </li>\r\n<li>Personal ties; </li>\r\n<li>Lack of access to human resources and expertise;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Reduced reporting lines; </li>\r\n<li>Facilitation of information circulation to both\r\ncommunicate information and retrieve relevant information that is necessary for\r\ncarrying out the restructuring process; </li>\r\n<li>Heavy and counter-producing administrative requirements,\r\nincluding when restructuring. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Moreover, the human factor is important for SMEs undergoing a restructuring process. According to him, there is a lot of bi- and multi-lateral work (communication) to generate trust among the workforce, which is less true for larger corporations. Retaining talents is also a challenge, especially for SMEs, who suffer from issues of under-valued work in general and in comparison to larger companies. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Nolet puts forward several recommendations for the attention of policy-makers: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Reducing administrative burden as much as possible:\r\nresources in SMEs are limited and time and resources are wasted on\r\nadministrative paper work on a regular basis, but also during restructuring\r\nprocess. Some useless administrative requirements may be particularly burdensome\r\nfor SMEs. </li>\r\n<li>Thresholds for being subject to heavy social obligations\r\n(work councils, etc.) should not be lowered at all costs.\r\nThis would bring no benefits and hinders/prevents the\r\nopen and direct communication existing in SMEs. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Ms Vigneron identifies the following SME-specific elements regarding the restructuring process: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The importance of the human factor: a large number of\r\nemployees are reluctant to change and show fear and defiance regarding the\r\nprocess. Management needs to make extra efforts to communicate with them and to\r\nreassure them. She confirms that Mr Nolet and the management were transparent.\r\nMoreover, they announced a process at the first opportunity, which was then\r\nfollowed and respected, and this generated trust and respect towards management.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>SMEs require people to be multi-skilled, not limited to\r\none’s job description. People need to be flexible, especially during\r\nreorganisation of work that follows restructuring events. </li>\r\n<li>Restructuring events have a positive impact on employees,\r\nas those who face the event and successive changes and subsequently adapt to\r\nthem see their self-confidence increasing.

"Construction Company, Belgium"~"Construction company"~"<p>The departure of two directors, and the assumption of the role by a new director not qualified for it increased the company’s financial problems at the same time as the economic crisis affected the construction industry. In order to save the company, the general manager agreed with a successor who would take over the company to restructure it, on condition that the successor guaranteed the restructuring of the company, and agreed to retain the company’s workers. The construction company is now continuing operations under the same name.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>In this company case study, only the change of ownership/management process is described, not subsequent events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile </h2>\r\n<p>Construction Company is a company active in the construction and renovation of residential and non-residential buildings as well as in carpentry.  Until the 1980s, Construction Company could complete entire projects without needing to subcontract parts of the construction to other companies. It handled the following aspects: basic construction, installation of electricity, heating, sanitary fittings, windows, roof, and so on. Over the last 20 years, the company has been concentrating on building carcasses and carpentry and subcontracts in other construction activities. </p>\r\n<p>Construction Company’s premises are located in a sparsely-populated region nearby the border of a neighbouring state. Consequently, the cross-border influences (both opportunities and threats) have been and still are important for the company.</p>\r\n<p>During the last 40 years, the General Manager has been assisted and supported by his wife, but generally speaking Construction Company has always been a company controlled by one person: the General Manager.</p>\r\n<p>Up to August 2011, the shares of the company were always held by the General Manager and members of his family. Until 2009, the administrative board of directors was composed of the General Manager and members of his family. In 2011, the General Manager sold 90% of the shares of the company to Company A, of which the Successor is a significant shareholder. Since September 2011, the administrative board of directors is composed of the General Manager, the Successor and Company A.</p>\r\n<p>While in the 1970s and 1980s, the most prosperous period for general construction companies in this region, Construction Company counted between 150 and 180 employees, since 2005 the company has included between 30 and 40 employees. This reduction of business size was due to personal factors – such as a tragic accident involving the General Manager’s family and the sudden death of the administrative director – as well as business factors: the concentration of activities as explained above. </p>\r\n<p>At the end of 2011, Construction Company counted on average 30 full-time employees and five employees working on a part-time basis, mainly blue-collar workers. None of the workforce has a higher vocational diploma. About 10 to 15 workers are carpenters based either in the workshop or at clients’ premises. Under the General Manager’s supervisory control, the company has been managed by one administrative director and one technical director.</p>\r\n<p>Under the General Manager, the company’s activities were almost entirely carried out on a local and/or national basis. </p>\r\n<p>The company has no corporate charter, no union delegation and no works council. General communications that had to be made to all members of the company were traditionally made by the General Manager in front of the workforce. </p>\r\n<p>While the company seemed to be progressively improving between 2005 and 2008 by constant growth in the gross operating margin and reducing the deferred losses, there was a cut in 2009 when the gross operating margin decreased and the deferred losses increased considerably. The reasons for this negative development will be analysed in the section below, ‘Background to restructuring events’. The restructuring of the company, started in 2011 by the Successor, was a necessary step. Thanks to several capital increases and reductions, the balance sheet situation was stabilised in 2011 and the latest figures show a promising direction.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The main reason for the restructuring of Construction Company was not a single event but generally speaking the ageing of the General Manager. However, this was accompanied by other circumstances that made the restructuring necessary.</p>\r\n<p>As in the most family-owned companies, the General Manager also wished from the beginning that the company would be taken over by one of his sons. However, for almost ten years, it seemed clear that his eldest son would not take over the company as he decided to go his own way in the private sector. Nevertheless, he was a member of the administrative board of Directors until 2011 in order to assist and support his father in the decision-making progress. The second eldest son worked for several years in the company, but, on the one hand, the General Manager considered him too young to take over the company, and on the other hand, an illness prevented him from accomplishing his tasks. Moreover, as we will explain below, the economic risk with respect to the take-over of the company was considerable. </p>\r\n<p>Despite the General Manager’s wish that the company would be taken over by his sons, he was aware that everything had to be right for this to happen, which is very rarely the case. Indeed, according to the General Manager, only 25% of family businesses are taken over by the children and only few of these family businesses are successful afterwards. According to the General Manager, the main reasons for these difficulties are the following: the founder does not want to leave the company, the successor feels permanently observed, the successor does not put the necessary energy into the business, etc. Generally speaking, according to the General Manager, it is difficult to establish a company, but it is even more difficult to take over an existing company.</p>\r\n<p>In 2008, the technical director had to leave the company because of his wife’s illness. This person worked for almost 30 years in the company and invested enormous energy into the company and worked day and night. It was impossible to replace him. Moreover, it was extremely difficult to find persons that were technically qualified for his functions. All published job offers were unsuccessful and competition with foreign job offers was too high. </p>\r\n<p>Therefore, a solution had to be found within the company. The staff member already employed by the company who took over the functions of the technical director was not the best solution. The new director knew that sooner or later the General Manager had to sell the company. He was personally interested in taking over the company, but did not have the financial resources to accept the General Manager’s offer. Consequently, he was not interested in improving the situation of the company but, on the contrary, sought the deterioration of the situation in order to reduce the value of the company. Moreover, he did not win the confidence of the workforce.</p>\r\n<p>Hence, the important decrease of the gross operating margin and the huge increase in the deferred losses between 2009 and 2011 was related to the leave of the two directors and the promotion of the new director, who was not qualified for the job.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the uncomfortable situation with the new director described above, the General Manager was the victim of a serious accident in 2010 that prevented him from actively taking part in the company for several months. He never fully recovered from the accident. In the aftermath of the accident, important decisions had to be taken by the General Manager’s family within the administrative board of directors. The new director gained even more power as he was the only active person having the experience and the technical skills to lead the company. In 2010, the administrative board of directors took the decision to fire the new director because of his poor leadership of the company.</p>\r\n<p>Even if in the construction sector the impact of economic crisis is generally felt later than in other sectors, the slump in 2009 was certainly also due to the economic crisis. However, we understand that the crisis was not the main reason for the bad figures.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, the need for restructuring was obvious. In the past, such restructuring has always been carried out successfully. As an example, in the 1980s Construction Company’s activity was based 90% on public turnkey construction contracts. Because of the decrease of the public offers, Construction Company had to reorient towards private contracts and concentrated its activity. </p>\r\n<p>In recent years, the General Manager was also looking for other solutions with respect to restructuring the company. Expansion of the business activity into the neighbour country has always been an option and in the past Construction Company has been internationally active. However, the foreign clients were small ones and often poor payers. Construction Company would have needed a real business unit in this country, with domestic foremen and workers in order to succeed in establishing a strong position in these markets. Indeed, according to the General Manager, the different technical regulations and legal frameworks in the neighbour country do not allow a middle-sized Belgian construction company, such as Construction Company, to gain important market shares in this state without installing fixed business units.</p>\r\n<p>In each and every case, Construction Company would have needed bank credit to realise the restructuring. The banks would only have granted the credits if the General Manager had accepted personal guarantees. In view of the age of the General Manager, the financial risk and the necessary energy were too high to consider the restructuring of the company by himself as a real option.</p>\r\n<p>Consequently, the search for an external investor was the sole possibility. While in the 1980s, this was very easy, as a lot of foreign companies were acquiring small and medium-sized enterprises in this region, it became much more difficult in the last 20 years. As the General Manager has a young family, he could not have considered selling his company in the 1980s. The General Manager always learned about persons who are possibly interested in acquiring his company by word-of-mouth communication. In the same way, he learned that the Successor, whose parents are friends of the General Manager, was potentially interested in acquiring a Construction Company even one with financial problems, provided that it still had a good reputation.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, the General Manager stated during the interview that there were three possible solutions in 2011 before meeting the Successor: to declare bankruptcy, to liquidate the company or to find a new investor. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In this particular case, the restructuring process was a very short one. As already stated above, the General Manager learned that the Successor was interested in acquiring a Construction Company in order to restructure it. Earlier, the Successor had been partner of a venture capital company that dealt with structuring and due diligence supervision. Later, as financial manager in a company active in the façade industry, he faced the challenges of building companies. Consequently, he had the necessary technical skills to organise the continuation of Construction Company.</p>\r\n<p>For the General Manager, the following conditions were important with respect to the acquisition of Construction Company by a new investor:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>	the successor had to guarantee the restructuring of the\r\ncompany;</li>\r\n<li>	the successor had to retain Construction Company’s\r\nworkers;</li>\r\n<li>	the General Manager wanted to follow the evolution of\r\nthe company.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>At the end of summer 2011, the General Manager and the Successor discussed all items concerning the functioning/structure of Construction Company, the modalities of the change of ownership and prepared all required formalities. The General Manager was keen to finalise the change of ownership in the short term in order to avoid rumours regarding the closure of the business.  </p>\r\n<p>In September 2011, Company A acquired 90% of the shares of Construction Company. In return for the liquid funds that were in Construction Company, the General Manager kept 10% of the shares and agreed to stay on as a member of the administrative board of directors. Company A guaranteed the company restructuring and to retain the workforce. Consequently, all of the abovementioned conditions were fulfilled with respect to the acquisition by Company A. Construction Company is now continuing operations under the same name. </p>\r\n<p>The change of ownership was communicated by the General Manager to the workforce shortly after the finalisation of the agreement during a general meeting. The details of the change were announced at the company’s traditional dinner before the winter break in the presence of the Successor. The workforce’s reaction was unanimously favourable as they were aware of the company’s financial difficulties. They were grateful that the General Manager and the Successor found this solution.</p>\r\n<p>The change of ownership was communicated to suppliers by letters and personal visits in order to introduce the Successor. The suppliers also reacted in a positive manner and gave the Successor the same good terms and conditions that they already gave the General Manager.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the clients have not been informed about the change of ownership. Indeed, Construction Company continued working under the same name and finished all projects in accordance with the agreements in place. According to the General Manager, there are still some clients that are not aware of the change of ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2> Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>In this particular case, from the point of view of the General Manager, there were no real challenges and constraints in the restructuring procedure.</p>\r\n<p>From the point of view of the Successor, the main difficulty was to estimate the time and human and financial resources necessary to manage current difficulties and obviously (re) develop the business. </p>\r\n<p>Most blue-collar employees were laid off and the company encountered a dramatic deterioration in the order book. Moreover, as already explained, the process of restructuring was quite short and consequently the due diligence process that sometimes allow dubious liabilities to be highlighted was also restrained. So the risks arising from the transaction, from the point of view of the investors, were very high, as Company A had to guarantee the financing of the restructuration. This would not have been possible without the confidence from the Successor to the General Manager on the situation of the Company.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support </h2>\r\n<p>As already mentioned above, the banks were only willing to grant credit if the General Manager would personally guarantee the repayment. Given his age, this option was not feasible. Regarding other possibilities of financial support, by public funds or venture capital companies, the General Manager has always been very cautious. He is against public funds as he thinks that they create discrimination between companies. Moreover, with respect to financial support by venture capital companies, the General Manager always feared the interference of these companies in the decision-making process within his company. Therefore, Construction Company has never been financially supported.</p>\r\n<p>The new investors came with an excellent track record with the bank sector. As the building sector is very cash-consuming due to long payment delays and a seasonal activity, the confidence from bankers was fundamental to finance part of the company’s restructuring. Investors had to finance accumulated arrears (and loss) and banks had to finance the short term needs for the new expansion of the business. </p>\r\n<p>Due to the good reputation of the successor, suppliers also agreed to delay the payment of some accounts.</p>\r\n<p>During the years before the transfer of the shares, the General Manager has always been assisted and supported by the members of this family. All possible solutions have been discussed within the family, in the broad sense of the term. The decision to sell the company to Company A has also been discussed and taken within the family. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The acquisition of the company was fully successful. The situation of Construction Company’s workers has not been negatively influenced by the acquisition. On the contrary, the secured continuation of the business as well as the restructuring of the company have been very well accepted by the workforce. Moreover, by continuing to use the same company name, Construction Company kept its former clients and can seize the new opportunities created by the new investor. The General Manager thinks that Construction Company is looking forward to a good future. </p>\r\n<p>Personally, the General Manager did not take directly financial advantage from the sales of shares. However, the General Manager still holds 10% of the shares and owns the land on which Construction Company is established. Thus, he collects rents from Construction Company. Moreover, it was very important for the General Manager to keep up a good image. The bankruptcy of Construction Company would have cast a negative shadow on his life work as well as on his children’s present and future careers. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The General Manager is very satisfied with the solution that has finally been found. The General Manager is also aware that the situation would have been much worse – in fact, the business would probably have closed – if the Successor had not have acquired Construction Company. </p>\r\n<p>Generally speaking, he believes that flexibility is very important for companies in the construction sector, as some of the workers have to be paid during the winter season even if there is no workload. He also thinks that the business environment changed very much in the last 50 years. Whereas in the past, the engagement of workforce was profitable for companies as the added value by the workforce exceeded the costs, nowadays he thinks that it is very difficult for small and middle-sized companies to be profitable. He feels that two or single-person enterprises are in a much more comfortable situation than middle-sized companies with respect to profitability, flexibility and risk exposure.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the General Manager believes that the support and assistance of one’s spouse is always crucial in small and middle-sized family businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>David Sarlette, Philippe &amp; Partners</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information Sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interview</h3>\r\n<p>Board Member (former CEO) and founder of the company </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Belgium"~"41 - construction of buildings"~"10-49"~"10-49"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2012-10-27"
"Consultancy Company, United Kingdom"~"Consultancy firm"~"<p>Following cutbacks in government expenditure, this business consultancy had to enter new markets in order to survive and grow, changing its service portfolio from programme design to delivery. Being small, the firm was more adaptable and flexible; however, existing personnel were less suited for the  new tasks. As a result of the organisational changes, 90% of senior managers exited and a new team was put in place. The company now has more frontline staff and fewer in managerial roles. Five months into the reorganisation, there has been an increase in performance in some areas.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Established in 1995, the company described in this case study is a London-based consultancy firm. The company operates mainly at a national, regional and sub-regional level, but also at the EU-level through the European Social Fund, European Regional Development Fund and community initiatives such as Leonardo.   </p>\r\n<p>Working with entrepreneurs, employees and business owners, this consultancy firm provides a range of services for individuals and businesses, including business advice, work-based qualifications, apprenticeships, training and development, employment and staffing. The services are funded by a variety of sources from the national governmental organisations to EU-level funding bodies. The company also works with communities through various partnerships with local authorities, colleges and universities, private training providers and voluntary and community organisations. In this area, their focus is on business development, research projects and evaluation studies, marketing and event management, programme and project management and community renewal and consultancy. They run training programmes from several offices in Greater London. In addition, they occupy office space provided by their partners to deliver products.</p>\r\n<p>People are the core company asset: the team consists of experts in areas of enterprise, employment and skills development. In May 2012, the company employed 45 staff. The employee numbers fluctuate depending on contract value and the state of the market. They have had a drop to around 35 in the previous twelve months and predict that they will employ up to 70 staff by March 2013. </p>\r\n<p>The company has been awarded a number of recognitions and has adopted various quality standards and systems to benefit both customers and staff. Their turnover has fluctuated from £3m (approximately €3.8m) to £5m (€6.4m) over a three year period up to 2012.</p>\r\n<p>For this case study, the Managing Director (MD) and the Development Director (DD) of the company were interviewed.</p>\r\n<p>The MD first joined the company in 2004 as its Commercial Director and has been the MD since 2005. He is the coowner and the major shareholder with around 60% of shares. The company has private investors alongside shares allocated for three Executive Directors. </p>\r\n<p>The MD has two degrees: a joint degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, and a Masters degree in Philosophy, Public Policy and Economic Development. He has gained experience in all areas of economic and social regeneration during his 20 year long career in public service provision. He has operated programmes aimed at young people, business support, social enterprise development, and work-based learning. </p>\r\n<p>Since joining the consultancy firm, the MD has actively reshaped the company, moving it into new areas such as brokerage, combining skills and employment, and developing deeper and broader partnerships and regional services in the Midlands and the South East of England.</p>\r\n<p>During his career, the MD has been involved in restructuring in one way or another about every two years. This is inevitable when working as a service provider for ever changing public sector where programmes regularly emerge and disappear with changes of Government.</p>\r\n<p>The Development Director has been with the company since 2003. During this time, he has progressed from various roles of Assistant Director into Director of Skills, Director of Skills and Employability, and Director of Operations. The role of the DD is to develop and win new business, generating income for the company to deliver. Moreover, he ensures that the transition from being successful with a new tender to making it operational is smooth. During his 12-year long career in this industry, the DD was involved in a number of small and major restructurings. He previously worked in multi-media design and IT training, owned a design company, and had also run a number of bars and restaurants. He originally trained as an architect.</p>\r\n<p>The company has undergone a major change in terms of its service portfolio in recent years. From 2004 to 2007, public money for certain programmes dried up. At the same time, the organisations that they would previously help receive money or develop products for found it difficult to deliver and increasingly asked them to help deliver outcomes rather than design programmes that deliver outcomes. Above all, the money that was available for businesses doing contracts moved from programme evaluation and design, which are not outcome focused, to programmes that are entirely outcome focused. The company has therefore moved from providing design and evaluation services into delivery, reflecting the government agenda. Consequently, 95% of their services consist of delivery of outcomes in relation to jobs, apprenticeships, NVQs and business support, and the remaining 5% is evaluation work.   </p>\r\n<p>There is no works council and the company has no relationships with trade unions.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>The company has undergone two restructurings in recent years. The first, in 2008, was due to a combination of a management buyout and regional expansion which did not bring a commercial return and the company retrenched to London and their home markets. This was in part due to changes in government policy in the training and business support markets. </p>\r\n<p>The focus of this case study is the second restructuring, in 2011, which was due to inefficiencies in the business and the key management not being capable to execute the new work that the company had won in new markets. </p>\r\n<p>As the company entered new markets and changed its service portfolio from programme design to delivery, the existing personnel became less suited for the required work. According to the MD, this was not due to lack of skills or inability of staff to carry out the work; however, they were not necessarily the right team for driving and delivering outcomes. As a consequence, the company started to experience two negative trends: not reaching its potential in terms of turnover and profit and losing contracts value from funders. </p>\r\n<p>At the same time, the company entered new markets in the post- 2010 general election period when competition was tough, market share was smaller and the money coming into the system was much smaller. As a result, larger firms in the industry were entering new markets because there was no work coming in from their usual streams. The present company, likewise, found it difficult to find contract value that was sufficient enough to keep the business going. And the contract value they had was not performing, partly due to the nature of the programmes, but also because they did not have the right team to drive performance in those areas.  </p>\r\n<p> In March 2011, the present DD moved a position and became the Operations Director (OD) to try and re-set some of the deliverables. Both the MD and the DD had a solid reputation. They had the organisational intelligence and market knowledge and so the MD took a chance at the time and promoted the current DD to OD. This however was going to be a short- to medium-term measure. The role of the OD was to manage staff and ensure smooth running of programmes. However, this did not work and from around September 2011, the MD started to feel that something was wrong with the positions of the OD and the Assistant Directors. At the time, the management structure of the company consisted of the MD, the OD, the DD, and Finance Director. Below the senior level, they also had three Assistant Directors in marketing, skills and employment.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In October 2011, the company appointed a new chief operating officer (COO), recruited from outside, with a background in programme delivery. Subsequently, the new COO and the MD looked closely at the business and decided to strip out the positions of Assistant Directors and restructure the company. The decision to restructure was taken by the MD in consultation with the Board and investors, with the aim to better adapt to their new markets and focus on outcome delivery. The restructuring, including planning, consultations with the Board, and implementation phase, took about two to three months to complete. The management developed a restructuring plan which was approved by the Board. </p>\r\n<p>The Board consists of several members: the MD, two investors, and an independent chairman with no stake in the business to ensure that everything goes by the book. Besides the Board, they have an Observer who scrutinises their finances. According to the MD, there was some resistance from Board members during negotiations. There was some concern that the company was restructuring again and there was also nervousness about whether it would work. Moreover, there was certain nervousness and differences of opinion about retaining particular employees. Board members not involved in the daily running of the company had different views, as opposed to the MD who thought over how they can actually use existing human resources. In the end, the board came to an agreement. An alternative to restructuring would have been closure.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring event was about changing the way the business operates for the sake of the business. The company needed a new structure which had inevitable consequences for employment as seven posts were made redundant, including the three Assistant Directors. The company informed all employees by circulating letters on 23 December. This was clearly quite distressing, given that employees learned about the decision just before the Christmas break. </p>\r\n<p>The company followed employment law and their own due process for handling redundancies; this involved consultations with the employees. According to the MD, some employees saw it coming but resisted and appealed against the decision. Eventually, the company signed a compromise agreement with all three employees. This was not a pleasant time for the company but it was necessary.    </p>\r\n<p>At the same time as making redundancies, new roles were being created through an open and transparent internal and external recruitment process. The redundant employees had the opportunity to apply for the new roles. One employee chose to apply and continues working at the company, two left and three employees were made redundant.  </p>\r\n<p>The new company structure includes two new Senior Operations Managers and a dedicated marketing division. The sales were moved directly under the operations management so there is a direct link into the delivery machine that then turns out the outputs as per contract requirements. The company increased the proportion of delivery done internally rather than externally through partnerships. By internalising delivery work, the headcount of frontline employees to management has shifted significantly. As a result of company reorganisation, they recruited twelve new staff who all received informal briefing sessions when they first joined.  </p>\r\n<p>Besides the mentioned negotiations, the MD and the newly appointed COO had a conversation with the OD about his role and decided to make that post redundant too. The MD thought that this employee had value for the business on the development side and was therefore offered the new position of the Development Director as he had the knowledge and experience required for the role. </p>\r\n<p>According to the MD, as a small business, it is important that you have an approach to people and what they might bring to the business even if what they are doing at that time is not particularly useful. The company has tried to compromise and retain staff during this and past restructurings where a post became redundant but it was thought that an employee could bring a value into other parts of the business. </p>\r\n<p>The cost of restructuring, including redundancy payments and compromise agreements, was around £20,000 (approximately €25,000), funded from the cash reserves of the company. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The MD notes that small businesses face problems when it comes to recruiting the right people. Some people want to see a progression fast or they join a bigger business. The family atmosphere in the small business with 50-60 staff is not for everyone, some people prefer a corporate environment and the company has to try and accommodate that. Recruiting the right people has been a great challenge. The company had been looking for a person with strong background and experience of delivery for about three years. They spent around £20,000 to £30,000 (approximately €25,000 to €37,000) on recruitment fees trying to recruit an Operations Director three times but failed because they could not find the right person. The company had to compromise on what they were really looking for. Besides the senior positions, they did not have the right team in place to drive delivery. </p>\r\n<p>One of the challenges the company faced during restructuring were human emotions. There was a degree of employee resistance, anxiety and sadness. Communicating with staff throughout the process has been very important for the company. They held 1-2-1 sessions, regular briefings, team meetings and full staff meetings. They also had to think about how best to communicate to the market the changes made; what to say to partners and to funders. The MD addressed this by initiating a number of briefing sessions with major funders to explain that the company is now in the business of delivery and has therefore moved their teams to ensure that funders get what they want in return for their money. </p>\r\n<p>The change of employment dynamics has created some tension between the culture that the new COO brought into the company – the crew of people he used to work with in previous organisations – and the pre-existing culture. To address this tension, they have done some work around certain ideas and preconceptions in order to bring people together. This involved a company quiz, role swap, IIP (Investors in People) implementation, old staff peer to peer with new staff, team away days and culture days. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring of the company changed the way that the operations division was structured in terms of the teams, line management, and the resources assigned between programme delivery and management coordination. As a result, 90% of senior managers exited and a new team was put in place. The company now has more frontline staff and fewer in managerial roles. The new structure is made up of a Managing Director, Chief Operating Officer, Finance Director, and a Business Development Director. They have Senior Office Managers who take care of day-to-day delivery, and more frontline staff such as business advisers and guidance workers.   </p>\r\n<p>In May 2012, five months into the reorganisation, there has been an increase in performance in some areas, but it is early days to evaluate the outcome fully. There is a degree of uncertainty as some promises of where the company would be by this time have not been fulfilled. Moving the current DD from operations into business development has been beneficial; they have since won an £8m (€10.2m) contract in March 2012.The DD was instrumental in making it work and driving performance. </p>\r\n<p>Both restructuring events in 2008 and 2011 resulted in staff reductions.During that period the employment number fluctuated depending on the contract value and changes to the market but the company was able to retain between 35-45 employees. As a result of the recent restructuring, two people left, three employees were made redundant, one re-applied for a different position and remained with the company and one was offered a different position. Some of the existing employees are still evaluating the recent changes and whether company aims will come to fruition. Time will show if they remain committed. </p>\r\n<p>There is some cultural tension between the pre-existing employees and the twelve new staff that joined the company. The management have addressed this by organising quiz events, team away days and one-to-one sessions to bring staff together. </p>\r\n<p>Turnover dropped initially by £2m (approximately €2.6m), and profit in the same proportion, but they are more stable in 2012. The company confirmed turnover of £5m (€6.4m) for the next three years and is in a healthier position. The MD predicts that in 2013 they have the potential to do very well; it will probably be their best year ever in the life of the company. </p>\r\n<p>Overall, the MD concludes that restructuring was painful but necessary and as a result the company is in a much healthier position to face the markets in which they operate. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring event described in this case study is an example of how a change in product markets can push a small company into restructuring. The cutbacks in government expenditure that have been implemented to cope with the deficit since 2010 have had a major impact on small company providers of public services such as this consultancy firm. With less money available and tougher competition, the company had to enter new markets. </p>\r\n<p>Restructuring was a necessary reaction to changing markets. Entering new markets and adapting to the new requirements rapidly meant that the company survived and continues to grow. As a small company, the consultancy firm was able to benefit from their ability to adapt quickly, unlike many companies in their markets that closed in recent years. </p>\r\n<p>With hindsight, the MD thinks that they should have implemented changes earlier when they crept into doing delivery. Instead, they decided to remain focused on their existing strengths which together did not work in the end. Despite this, the MD does not have any regrets about what they did and the processes followed. There are two important aspects to mention. First, the emotional response of human beings directly affected by the changes; and second, in the aftermath, the importance of linking people left behind, who go through a sort of grieving process, together with the new people who join the company.  </p>\r\n<p>This restructuring affected the DD more than any previous restructuring events due to the non-performance to the required level in his previous role as the OD. Appointing him to that role was a compromise not only for the company but for him personally.  At the time, he was not 100% confident that the role was right for him; he feared that it was not really what he should have been doing. His strengths are in business development which is where he moved eventually and has been successful since. The DD notes that restructuring is a necessity. Markets are never stagnant, they change, and SMEs therefore need to react and find new markets. Market change drives restructuring and SMEs arguably need to restructure more often than large businesses. Even minor restructuring can have a greater impact within an SME but SMEs should not be frightened of it and should seek external advice and guidance if they do not have previous experience of restructuring. </p>\r\n<p>As time moved on and there was a greater demand for programme delivery, the consultancy firm also had to move on and therefore the structure of their business had to change. Within that structure, changes were made which inevitably had implications for employment at managerial and other occupational levels. A number of staff left, some moved into different positions and some were made redundant. At the same time, the company recruited new staff with skills and experience that would match the new focus on delivery. In that process, they lost the intelligence, knowledge and experience of people who had worked at the company for years. There has been a change in company culture as a result of tensions between incumbent employees and new staff; however, the company is putting time and effort into trying to bring people together and ensuring that people know the company culture.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Eva Kasperova, John Kitching and David Smallbone, Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>Interview with the Managing Director and the Development Director</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"United Kingdom"~"70 - activities of head offices; management consultancy activities"~"10-49"~"10-49"~NULL~"internal restructuring"~"2012-05-17"
"Fitecom, Portugal"~"Fitecom, Lda"~"<p>Fitecom, based in Portugal, manufactures textiles and wool products. The main motivation for restructuring was the need to become environmentally friendly, reduce energy consumption costs and recycle waste. The goal of the restructuring process was to implement an integrated system of environmental management alongside lean management practices to improve productivity. It was important to involve employees in the waste-reduction efforts, to increase their sense of responsibility and inclusion. The acquisition of specific and specialised know-how and employee training were also part of the restructuring plan.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Fitecom, a legally independent/corporate company, was founded in 1993 by three professionals (they are still the owners) with knowledge and expertise in the field of textile engineering, with a financial capital of €450.000,00, having started its activity after buying the building and equipment of an historic textile factory of Covilhã, centre region of Portugal. The company’s main activity is the manufacturing of wool/textiles (NACE 13202). </p>\r\n<p>The president of the board of the three directors is Engineer João Carvalho, with a share of 51.14% of the capital, a former professor of textile engineering at the University of Beira Interior (UBI) and consultant for a project involving textile engineering at the same university. He owns two other companies related to agriculture and wine production. The company has also a member of the board of directors who owns a 33.31% share, a financial director with a 15% share, a general assembly president and a general assembly secretary, having the remaining 0.55% share. The company has a major stake in a Portuguese company, Sociedade Têxtil da Beira Interior, S.A., with a 99.92% share of the capital with 55 employees. </p>\r\n<p>Nowadays, there are 120 employees at Fitecom. The region is traditionally known for its manufacturers of textile and wool and historically it has strong unions related to this specific sector. The workers are unionised in local trade unions and Fitecom has representatives who are responsible for the dialogue with the trade unions and represent the interests of the group.</p>\r\n<p>Fitecom is organised in five main departments according to the production process and supply value chain, namely: spinning; carding; weaving, finishing and dying.</p>\r\n<p>The main export markets are France, UK, Denmark, Germany and Spain, covering about 90% of exports. </p>\r\n<p>The main products and fabrics are 100% wool, wool and polyester, wool and lycra, and the firm hasan annual turnover of €10.5 million. </p>\r\n<p>The main distribution channels are agents located in several countries, such as: France, the UK, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands, Italy, Norway, the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Turkey. The company produces about 2.5 million meters of fabric per year.</p>\r\n<p>The type of clients that Fitecom deals with is mostly composed of final distributors and retailers that operate the textile and clothing industry. </p>\r\n<p>The business performance before the restructuring event was characterised by a pattern of stability in terms of sales’ evolution until 2009, and by an increase both in sales and turnover, after 2010. Furthermore, the number of employees increased from 104 in 2006 to 120 at the time of the interview (summer 2012). </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In 1999, the company implemented an investment plan, which included the building of a new plant and the replacement of almost all technological equipment. This new building started operating in 1999, in a 16,000 m<SUP>2</SUP> area, using high-tech machinery.</p>\r\n<p>These changes are part of the restructuring event that Fitecom had implemented as part of a specific internal restructuring process. This type of restructuring was guided by an internal reorganisation that did not result in the reduction of the number of employees, but in a reorientation of industrial and commercial activities, targeted at innovation and diversification in products, resulting in the adoption of new production processes and the implementation of quality standards. </p>\r\n<p>The organisational culture of the firm is based on the continuous improvement of quality, design and price, and also on the development of partnerships with the main customers, aiming to promote the success of the involved parties.</p>\r\n<p>The quality of the product is the main competitive advantage of the firm. To achieve this, Fitecom has a modern laboratory, with the latest technology, in order to control the phases of the supply chain value, which ranges from the raw material to the distribution of final product. </p>\r\n<p>The company operates in the wool markets for daily garments and uniforms. In these markets, Fitecom intends to foster the value added by its product, by taking into account the consumer's profile, adding functionalities to its textiles, besides the parameters of technical performance needed for this sort of applications that are already provided by the firm.</p>\r\n<p>To accomplish this, Fitecom is certified by several product trademarks, such as the license by ‘Australian Wool Innovation’ for the production and commercialisation of ‘Woolmark’ products, the certification Öko-Tex, the recognition for the ‘Lycra Assured’ programme licensed by Invista, the license by Advansa for the application of ‘Teflon’ finishing, is permitted to use the trademark Trevira - Clasixx and the license for the production and commercialisation of ‘Coolmax’ and ‘Thermolite’ products, aimed at medium and medium / high quality markets.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, internationalisation activities to expand markets were also one of the main goals of the company in the restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>The goal of the restructuring process was to implement an integrated system of environmental management and lean management practices, and thus progressing the company in terms of financial sustainability, energy consumption and textile waste management. For instance, from the waste that is mainly textile, 66% went to landfills and 34% were reintroduced in the process. Carding was the department that was responsible for the majority of waste and residuals, whereas the spinning and the winding departments are the ones responsible for recycling the wastes and residuals, by reintroducing them in an efficient way into the production process. Furthermore, Fitecom observed that the departments of spinning and carding were the main energy consumers, especially the spinning equipment that operates on a continuous basis.</p>\r\n<p>The main motivation for restructuring was the need to become environmentally friendly and reduce energy consumption, costs derived from the misuse of energy and bad use of wastes that could be recycled and reintroduced in the supply chain value to improve performance standards.</p>\r\n<p>This process was urgent, mainly because the company needed to reduce energy consumption costs, based on a previous analysis. Fitecom was interested in becoming an environmentally responsible and eco-efficient company. Furthermore, the company intended to provide better in-house working conditions, and a work environment that motivates and provides healthy conditions for their internal and external stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring event was initiated in 2007, through a project with a national financing support, called ‘PRERESI – Industrial Wastes Prevention’, and it resulted from a board decision in order to create a team, at the company level, responsible for the development of a set of activities defined by the team leading the project (National Institute for Residues and National Institute of Engineering, Technology and Innovation). Although the subsidised project ended in 2010, the procedures of the restructuring are still going on. Fitcom was contacted to join the project since the company is a reference company in national terms in its sector and is also a partner of the Technological Centre for Textile and Clothing (CITEVE) that was involved in the partnership. The team involved was informed and also consulted before the process started, as the worker’s union was not involved. </p>\r\n<p>This team involved the directorate of the company, engineers and a collaborator from accounting. In addition, there were technicians from CITEVE that were responsible for gathering data and mapping the process. </p>\r\n<p>This process was part of the national plan for the waste and residues prevention from the Ministry of Economy and Innovation, aiming to implement a coordinated plan for Fitecom.</p>\r\n<p>In this context, the company board developed a plan for the restructuring event with a set of instruments that are presented hereafter.</p>\r\n<p>The company developed a set of programmes to improve the environmental performance of processes and products in the form of an environmental management system, a life-cycle analysis and designs for environmental and eco-efficiency certification. The goal was also to increase employee responsibility and inclusion, by involving them in joint efforts for waste reduction. Another premise besides this was that lean manufacturing influences financial performance through improving organi sational processes, eco-efficiency and labour and productivity of the assets. </p>\r\n<p>The process entailed an initial phase, the contextualisation of the specific scenario of Fitecom, where the plan was designed and organised, the team selected by the board of directors from the company and the goals transmitted to the team and the process mapped. The second phase was about identifying opportunities of intervention, it was about listing problems, such as the extreme amount of wastes produced and not treated, the lack of know-how from workers to perform accordingly, or the costs associated with the non-use of wastes, for example. The third phase covered the process of understanding the problem and searching for pathways to solve it, by establishing a causal approach and defining opportunities. The fourth phase was about the development and valuation of solutions and the last phase covered the decision process, implementation and monitoring.</p>\r\n<p>The process that was developed over a one year period was then initiated in the company, by taking a set of actions, namely mapping the production processes, covering three types of operations, namely the principal, the auxiliary and the end of the line. The principal operation covers the product transformation units, the auxiliary covers the quality control and the end of the line covers waste and residue handling. </p>\r\n<p>Other actions taken were the mapping of the waste in terms of fibrous residues, plant and land waste for the units that produce the waste, namely batch preparation, spinning, carding and winding. After this, the team identified the major causes for vegetal and fibrous waste generation. </p>\r\n<p>The next set of actions covered the acquisition of specific and specialised know-how and employees' training. In a first phase, this covered just one delegate from the company and later several workers, from the five departments of Fitecom plus accounting. </p>\r\n<p>The training was in situ training, training on the job, organised meetings with the leading team and selected key persons from Fitecom. </p>\r\n<p>The next actions covered the tasks of analysing the most effective economic, eco-efficient and environmentally-friendly solutions, in order to increase awareness of the importance of tuners and efficiency of the pitch for minimising losses and material waste and afterwards for recovering a part of the production costs. </p>\r\n<p>The main measures/solutions included the careful monitoring of stocks of materials and products, the implementation of a monitoring system of an inputs/outputs process and the adoption of efficient housekeeping and verification practices. It was decided to establish a detailed production procedures manual to avoid losses in the allocation of resources due to bad practices and to separate the waste by class and degree of dangerousness that can affect the recycling of waste. In addition, it was decided to proceed with the installation of flow controllers and the use of returnable packaging, as well as introducing the computerisation of the administrative services and the selection of supplies in order to reduce the variability of containers. Fitecom started to replace the raw material used by one of improved quality, containing less contamination and reused shorter fibres in the production of thicker yarn.</p>\r\n<p>Another initiative that the company decided to implement was about starting to control the production process to reduce the number of nonconforming products. Furthermore, to improve financial performance it was decided to reuse the waste out of the production process, to conduct a periodic review of the revenues achieved with all these measures, to use automated systems for the determination and distribution of chemicals, to recover chemicals for reuse. In addition, to reduce water consumption and wastewater production, the company started using machines that use less water. They also replaced overflow washes by drain/fill washes, reusing the washing water (for example reusing the water from washing lighter colours; the last rinse can be used in first washes, etc.), changing the colour management to optimise the number of washes and implementing the use of reactive dyes with high fixing percentages and reduced salt.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenges are related to the implementation and monitoring of an integrated system of environmental management in Fitecom that can be summarised as follows. The management needs to establish a surveillance plan in order to perform a periodic review of the revenues achieved with all these measures. It needs to control the production process to reduce the number of nonconforming products, to establish a detailed production procedures manual to avoid wastage of resources due to bad practices and to train the employees in areas such as: tuning and maintenance, environmental management practices. In addition, as major challenges stem from the implementation of the plan, the firm needs to bring all employees on board and make them accept the decisions made in the introduction of the environmental management process, to rethink daily routines marked by this policy and change attitudes and behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>This restructuring event is part of the project ‘PRERESI – Industrial Wastes Prevention’. The implementing team involved the management of the company, engineers from the production departments and a collaborator from the accounting department. In addition, CITEVE helped by gathering data and mapping the process. This process was part of the national plan for the waste and residuals prevention from the Ministry of Economy and Innovation and the goal was to implement a coordinated plan for Fitecom. This project was supported by a financial initiative from the national EU funds, called Prime. </p>\r\n<p>This is a continuous process, initiated in 2007 and that is an evolving situation and still going on. The company is also collaborating in R&amp;D projects with the local university and technological centres in the treatment of residues and the reuse of the same. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The major outcomes of the process were an increase in the resource profitability, the implementation of preventive measures and technologies that allowed for a textile waste reduction of approximately 27% as a whole, and of 50% of the sludge, a reduction in the consumption of water, energy and products and a decrease in the overall waste level. </p>\r\n<p>At the management level, a training plan was established for workers to internalise the company's waste minimisation policy as being a key issue and a priority for the company due to economic, environmental and corporate factors. Part of the strategy also included informing consumers about the company's environmental policy, in order to improve financial performance, by reducing costs and increasing sales and turnover. There was an increase after the process and the same happened with the employment levels, as it was possible to contract more employees due to the expansion of sales and production, by adding value to the products and making better use of the resources and achieving an increased competitiveness.</p>\r\n<p>Through this methodology Fitecom was able to reduce costs, increase environmental awareness in-house and with clients and other stakeholders level and decrease time waste. </p>\r\n<p>An additional outcome of the process at Fitecom was the development of an integrated management system that created policies geared towards improved hygiene, health and safety applied to all workers, in order to avoid professional accidents derived from the new practices and increase competitiveness.</p>\r\n<p>Among the fundamental principles of this policy were the identification, evaluation and prevention of risks to safety and promotion of health in the workplace (physical, chemical and biological), the preventive/corrective planning of programmes and their risk assessment measures for all the company's activities, as well as for occupational hazards in general, the information and training on risks to health and safety, as well as protection and prevention on measures and the planning of appropriate monitoring programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The new environmental innovation cycle pursued by the company allied with new practices of human resources management focused on the development of skills and competences required at this, made it possible to reposition Fitecom competively as a leading SME in the field, due to the high quality of the product, aligned with a high concern with eco-efficiency, environmental and energy waste reduction issues. Waste prevention can be achieved through innovative changes in products, processes and operations. </p>\r\n<p>The firm implemented several restructuring measures, such as changes in procedures and management, in controlling and monitoring parameters, substitution of products, changes in technology, changes in the composition or product packaging and the reuse of waste generated in the company.</p>\r\n<p>The employees were positively affected and motivated through the involvement in the changing mission of the company, such as the constant training in the areas of expertise and in environmental practices, the hiring of new workers and the expansion of the business, characterised by parameters targeted at high levels of quality and safety. The restructuring process altered the entire modus operandi of the company concernig environmental practices in the production process.</p>\r\n<p>This demonstrates that the residuals prevention must be part of a plan and must be understood by the firm as a whole. Furthermore, the sustainability and performance (eco-efficient, environmental, economic and social) of the company depends upon the minimization of wastes and residuals and the maximization of efficiency in processes and operations. </p>\r\n<p>In order to achieve the success planned from the goals previously defined, all stakeholders (board, administration, executive management, workers, suppliers, clients, etc.) must be in tune, for which internal communication is vital. For instance, clients were indirectly involved: they not only functioned as drivers of such a process, especially clients from countries like France, the UK, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland, who were extremely oriented towards environmentally sound production processes, but also as targets of the company’s policies in this regard. Internal communication allows changing either at the beginning or at the end of the process, identifying and motivating the team, spreading procedures and updating and ensuring a balance between several areas. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Author </h2>\r\n<p>Dina Pereira, UBI and João Leitão, UBI, IPP and CEG-IST</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>	Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>João Carvalho, President of the Board of Directors and Luis Costa, Accountancy, Fitecom, Lda</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>	Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Parque industrial do Tortosendo, </p>\r\n<p>Lote 1, 6200-750 Tortosendo</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>	Company website</h3>\r\n<p> <a HREF=""http://www.fitecom.pt/"">www.fitecom.pt</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>	Secondary sources</h2>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.einforma.pt/"">http://www.einforma.pt</a> </p>\r\n<p>Media</p>\r\n<p>Project PreResi, financed by PRIME.</p>\r\n<p>Project GESTINN, financed by Interreg Sudoe.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Portugal"~"13 - manufacture of textiles"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"greening"~"internal restructuring"~"2012-06-01"
"Foodstuff Company, Belgium"~"Foodstuff company"~NULL~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Foodstuff Company is a company active in the processing, wholesale and retail trade of food. Foodstuff Company was founded in 1984 by the current Board Member and former CEO, as a means to diversify his agricultural activities. At the outset, the company was breeding a small stock of animals for the benefit of a French company but, following the bankruptcy of the latter, it was decided to start breeding animal stock for Foodstuff Company’s own activities. </p>\r\n<p>Foodstuff Company rapidly developed a sales network, followed by the opening up of franchised shops and restaurants/<i>tables d’hôtes</i>. In 1996, Foodstuff Company started offering their products in the Belgian supermarket chain, Delhaize Group SA, as well as to the Belgian supermarket chain Colruyt NV. Between 2005 and 2010, Foodstuff Company took over three companies: </p>\r\n<p>•	Company A (2005), a Brussels-based company specialised in the processing of food; </p>\r\n<p>•	Company B (2007), based in Flanders, delivering food to restaurants; and</p>\r\n<p>•	Company C (2010), a company based in the German speaking part of Belgium, specialised in food production and sales. </p>\r\n<p>The takeover of these three companies is the ‘restructuring event’ for the purpose of the present case study. </p>\r\n<p>The shareholding of Foodstuff Company has been exclusively family-owned from the date of creation of the company until May 2012. So, for the period of restructuring, that is from 2005 to 2009, the capital was family-owned exclusively. </p>\r\n<p>In early 2012, 20% of Foodstuff Company’s activities qualified as ’international‘, that is exports to the Netherlands, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, to Hong Kong, Mexico and Japan. </p>\r\n<p>In early 2012, Foodstuff Company had 42 employees working on site in the historical centre of the company, the family farm. In addition, approximately 40 employees worked outside, notably in the franchised restaurants/shops, and these are all employed by Foodstuff Company. Foodstuff Company’s employees are equally divided between men and women. There is a high level of employee loyalty as some families have worked for two generations within the company. The employee population counts more blue-collar than white-collar workers. Most employees have no diploma at all, whereas some hold a vocational training certificate and four have a university degree. Half of the employees have never had another employer than Foodstuff Company. There is no human resources charter at Foodstuff Company, but the company’s values – mutual respect, availability and flexibility – are strong within the company. There is no works council at Foodstuff Company, the legal thresholds for such a body not being fulfilled.  </p>\r\n<p>Over the last five years, Foodstuff Company’s turnover steadily increased by 20% each year. In 2011, the turnover was €12 million. </p>\r\n<p>At the outset, the current general manager was a farmer. His wish to diversify his farming activities rapidly made him responsible for large fruit orchards in Belgium and abroad. He holds a secondary education certificate in Latin and classical Greek. He dropped out of university to start working as a farmer. </p>\r\n<p>The employee interviewed for the case study has a vocational training certificate in the field of hospitality business gained in 1993. He worked in the hospitality business sector for seven years before joining Foodstuff Company in 2000. At Foodstuff Company, he started as a white collar worker assigned to the production chain for a couple of years. He then became responsible for production for five years. He is currently a purchasing manager responsible for buying or approving the acquisition of approximately 650 goods needed by the company. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The cause of the restructuring event is the aspiration of Foodstuff Company’s manager to grow externally and to diversify his activities, combined with his personal knowledge of the market, including personal/professional relationships with general managers of other companies/competitors:</p>\r\n<p>•	With the takeovers of Company A and of Company C, Mr General Manager saw an opportunity and was willing to expand and diversify his portfolio of food offered. </p>\r\n<p>•	With the takeover of Company B, Mr Employee was willing to expand his customer base, by notably having access to restaurants.  </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was quite simple, mostly based on personal contacts with the managers of the purchased companies and knowledge of these companies’ activities. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was relatively informal. The general manager, due to his long involvement in the industry and his proactivity, knew of the existence of potential companies to be purchased and took time to get to know these companies’ managers better. He thus first made informal contact with the potential companies to be purchased. After some time elapsed, the managers eventually agreed to the purchase and the purchase was structured, with limited external support, that is basic legal advice from a local law firm and support from the company’s external accountant/auditor. After the purchase was executed, for approximately six months nothing was changed in the daily running of either of the purchased company, spending time observing the daily management, asking questions to the management and the staff. Once the learning curve was over, change was implemented, for example replacing inefficient processes by more efficient ones (replacement of one packaging process by another one, for example). </p>\r\n<p>The takeover of Company A was unplanned; it was an opportunity that emerged out of the blue. Company A was located in Brussels and it was decided not to use the premises of Brussels, but to relocate all activities to the family farm, approximately sixty kilometres away. The takeovers of Company C and of Company B were more planned; the general manager was actively on the lookout for external growth and activity diversification. According to him, being ‘out there’ looking for opportunities was made possible thanks to the efficient support of some employees and, more importantly, his wife. This support allowed him to delegate the day-to-day management and to concentrate on strategies and on exploring the market. All three purchased activities/companies were relocated to the family farm or the vicinities of it due to the wish to keep activities close to the family farm.  </p>\r\n<p>The employees were never consulted before or during the transaction. Employees were informed once the transaction was executed, during a single meeting in the cafeteria. Employees were presented with the ‘<i>fait accompli</i>’, that is, informed only afterwards about the deal. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>According to the general manager, the restructuring events went smoothly and quickly, without any major difficulty. External financing by banks was necessary for all three purchases, but, the debt proportion was low/reasonable at each time and the track record of the company was excellent, which made things relatively easy except for the following: Access to external financing was an issue for the takeover of Company A, where the debt level of the company was relatively high, following the withdrawal of a historical shareholder, whose shares were taken over by the company. Banks were difficult, requiring bank guarantees, which represented a financial burden for the company. The company managed to obtain the bank guarantee and, in the end, they were never executed, which is seen by the company to demonstrate that banks tend to be difficult with SMEs when it comes to allowing funding. </p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the heavy red tape surrounding access to financing, notably for restructuring purposes, was seen as a negative factor, and simplification of administrative process should be considered.</p>\r\n<p>According to the interviewed employee, more information could improve employees’ acceptance of the restructuring event. He points out a specific fear of employees regarding the impact of the restructuring event on the quality of work. As the sector is seasonal, work becomes very intense from early October until the end of the Christmas/New Year period; taking into account that the activities of Foodstuff Company almost doubled over the considered period of time/restructuring period – as explained below, employees legitimately feared a concomitant increase of workload, which, in the end, did not really occur. More information could ease such types of fears, the interviewed employee believes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>Foodstuff Company did not benefit from external financial support for the three acquisitions, apart from the financing from the banks, mentioned above. Both the lawyer and the accountant who provided external technical support were personal acquaintances of the general manager, so it was not an issue for him to find such external support. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The outcomes of the restructuring event are positive from the company perspective: </p>\r\n<p>•	Steady increase of the yearly turnover of 20% since 2007; </p>\r\n<p>•	Increased competitiveness due to the diversification of supply sources; </p>\r\n<p>•	Increased market shares; </p>\r\n<p>•	Increased profitability; </p>\r\n<p>•	Diversification of production chain; and</p>\r\n<p>•	Modernisation of processes and distribution methods. </p>\r\n<p>This is confirmed by the interviewed employee who notes that, following the restructuring event, Foodstuff Company improved the purchase management. Generally speaking, Foodstuff Company became more efficient. </p>\r\n<p>Following the takeover of Company A, numerous employees of the purchased company eventually left on a voluntary basis. Out of the 23 former employees, five are still working within Foodstuff Company today. The interviewed employee explains this by the fact that these employees did not like the fact that they had to drive to their relocated workplace on a daily basis without further financial compensation. It needs to be noted, though, that no one had to be fired: people left on a voluntary basis or retired, and were not replaced afterwards. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring event did not lead to important changes in work arrangements, such as conversion of full-time jobs into part-time jobs or conversely. Likewise, social packages/employment contracts were not modified. </p>\r\n<p>Following the restructuring event, work organisation has changed for some employees, as reported by the interviewed employee. He explains that, for his part, the diversification of the production chain and the subsequent merger of two different activities generated a lot of work as well as the learning of new tasks and processes (new machines and the like), which employees have learnt to manage (increase of work) and develop (new tasks/skills/processes) ‘on-the-spot’, that is, without external training. He says he gained new skills/competences and knowledge following the restructuring event. </p>\r\n<p>The outcome of the restructuring event on the general manager’s own assets/estate was positive as well. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The general manager sees some advantages that SMEs have over larger companies in restructuring, notably flexibility and speed; and the fact that decisions are taken by a handful of people, without having to go through extensive reporting lines, which gives a clear competitive advantage over larger competitors. The interviewed employee confirms this. He moreover notes that task allocation in SMEs is less clear than in larger companies, also during/following restructuring, but he does not identify this as being either a negative or a positive aspect. </p>\r\n<p>One drawback in SME restructuring is the lack of human, technical and financial resources.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, high taxes in Belgium following a restructuring event and/or in general are an issue for SMEs. He explains that high taxes lower Belgian SMEs’ profitability, which forces some of them to eventually go out of business or sell out their activities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Cécile Musialski, Philippe &amp; Partners</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews </h3>\r\n<p>Board member (former CEO) and founder of the company, and purchasing manager</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Belgium"~"10 - manufacture of food products"~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"business expansion*merger / acquisition"~"2012-07-26"
"Furniture Company, Italy"~"Furniture company"~"<p>This Italian furniture company was compelled to restructure when faced with falling orders, turnover and profits. The company implemented the CIGO measure, under which part of its workforce reduced their working hours while receiving 80% of their normal salary. At the end of the CIGO, the company implemented a solidarity contract for some employees, who reduced their working hours by 20% while receiving 80% of the lost salary for the non-worked hours. Employees at the company’s smaller production site were laid off under a mobility procedure. The restructuring process has required continuous organisational adjustments, both in terms of tasks and roles.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The group is composed of three branches: the manufacturing of furniture accessories and decorative hardware, and industrial design.</p>\r\n<p>The company was founded in the 1950s and has been run since then as a family business, and it is now in its third generation. Ownership and management are concentrated in the same hands. </p>\r\n<p>Since its foundation, the company has invested in a strong design discipline and manufacturing expertise. In order to respond to the emergence of new trends in the 1970s, a second company was founded in the plastics sector to offer plastic with conscious, intrinsic value as a material that is strongly expressive as well as being technically versatile and highly functional. In addition, a third brand was introduced to renew classic taste, mixing it with the modern aspects of design. This brand introduces a new era in which industrial product is enhanced with elegance and optimum quality. </p>\r\n<p>The company has two production sites. The main site is adjacent to the main offices and it is where they manufacture and cast products in zamak. A second smaller unit, located in a nearby village, is engaged in molding processes.</p>\r\n<p>The company has 74 employees; of these 38 are women and four non-nationals. In terms of educational profiles among the staff, five hold tertiary degrees, 17 have an upper secondary education, 45 have secondary education and three have primary education qualifications. The company has no information on the educational profile of the four foreign members of the staff. Seven employees (of whom four part-time workers) are employed in the second productive unit of the company, while the remainder 67 staff are employed in the main offices and main production site. </p>\r\n<p>Despite the fact that the number of employees has diminished in the past few years, from 91 staff in 2009 to 82 staff in 2010 and currently 74 staff in 2012, the company did not make any dismissals. The decrease in the number of employees has been solely due to voluntary redundancies or natural wastage. </p>\r\n<p>There is a unitary work council (<i>Rappresentanza sindacale unitaria</i>, RSU). This body is elected by all employees, but representatives are usually elected through trade union lists. Therefore, it includes features of both works councils (the broad active electorate) and trade union bodies (the almost exclusive inclusion of trade union representatives). In general, it can be associated with trade union bodies. The RSU was highly involved in the described restructuring process.</p>\r\n<p>The company is very embedded in the local community: 20 years ago, 80% of the employees cycled to work. Nowadays, all employees live a maximum of 40 kilometres from the company. Also the owners of the company live nearby and are well rooted in the local community.</p>\r\n<p>The company does not have a written human resources strategy. Human resources management is administered internally by each head of sector, who is responsible for all aspect of human resources and their development, whereas other aspect of administration, such as pay-rolls, are outsourced to an external consultant. </p>\r\n<p>The company has a large number of clients: around 1,000 active clients, both from Italy and abroad. Foreign clients are mainly located in Europe, the US and Russia. The client base in Russia grew extensively during the last ten years. The company has also some clients in Asia and South Africa as well as some in North African countries. </p>\r\n<p>Distribution in Italy is carried out through hardware products wholesalers or producers of furniture. The same applies to foreign markets, where they either sell to furniture producers or they resell directly on foreign markets via local wholesalers. </p>\r\n<p>Since the economic crisis, the Italian market for hardware products shrank dramatically, however this was partially offset by a considerable expansion on foreign markets in the last years, in particular in Russia, France and Germany. In general, around 63 % of turnover derives from the Italian market while the rest from foreign markets. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Due to the economic crisis, turnover started to fall by 30–35% since 2008. However, this fall was not immediate; indeed turnover fell by 27% in 2008–2009, and decreased further in 2010 and 2011, even if for 2011, the decrease was concentrated in the first quarter. </p>\r\n<p>Profits have diminished considerably. The market is much more exigent, as customers demand perfection; furthermore, most of the clients of the company no longer purchase to build up stock, but rather order items already sold to their own customers. This implies an increase in the stock of the company with a longer rotation of this stock, as well as very quick delivery times. Financially, for the company this means an increase in costs and a reduction in profits. Moreover, the intrinsic characteristics of the Italian labour market, which do not allow companies to adjust employment levels quickly to market developments, lead to rigidities and profits reduction. </p>\r\n<p>The company was also largely affected by a strong speculation on the raw materials which are used in their production. This speculation could not be reflected in the prices, as these had to be kept stable or in some cases reduced in order to make them more appealing to their customers, who were also suffering from the economic crisis. Also repayment terms had to be extended and renegotiated, while conversely, access to credit, funding and financing were extremely limited. </p>\r\n<p>The company has also suffered a lot from competition from foreign countries with a cheaper labour force. As already discussed, the company’s production is all made in Italy and based on a strong design element. The company launches about 35 new products per year and in order to develop these, they study, research and develop at least four times that many. This is a very long and costly process, however once produced and launched on the market the product and its industrial design can be immediately replicated by competitors. Most competition comes from China and Turkey.</p>\r\n<p>To counteract the difficult developments of the economic and financial crisis as well as the rise of competitor countries at the end of 2008 company decided to implement a restructuring programme. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring process</h2>\r\n<p>Since the end of 2008,  turnover fell and costs became unsustainable. There was also a surplus of human resources compared to the level needed under the new conditions which could not be offset even by natural wastage, so the company started to consider which feasible options could be implemented to face the new deteriorated economic conditions. The company decided to implement a restructuring process via the use of social shock absorbers.</p>\r\n<p>In May 2009 the company introduced the ordinary wage guarantee fund (<i>cassa integrazione ordinaria</i> CIGO – see also Eurofound, 2010). Under this arrangement, on a rotation base the affected employees were working reduced hours, receiving 80% of their normal salary. The CIGO affected both production sites and some offices. In the administration and in the trade divisions there was no necessity to implement short-time working, as these offices operated already with a limited number of staff. The average number of non-worked hours is eight hours per week. At the beginning the company had opted for working one less hour per day, however in order to guarantee continuity in the production cycle, the company decided to concentrate the hours under the CIGO on two days, during which the affected staff worked on a rotation basis. </p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the specific contract which regulates the conditions of employees of the company (<i>contratto metalmeccanico</i>) envisages a large number of paid hours for special leave. Thus at the beginning of the restructuring process, those employees who had accumulated a considerable number of hours of paid special leave had been encouraged to make use of them during periods of reduced work. For the main productive site and the affected offices, the CIGO lasted until the end of June 2012. At the end of the CIGO, the company had to re-evaluate its conditions. Indeed, as there was too many staff in proportion to the amount of work and turnover, the company decided to implement a solidarity contract (<i>contratto di solidarietà</i>, see also Eurofound, 2010) for a number of its employees. Solidarity contract is a social shock absorber which provides for short-time working of equal measure for the whole workforce of a unit or division, while employees benefit from income support of 80% of the lost wage. In this specific case, the solidarity contract affected 51 employees who under this agreement reduced their working hours by 20%, while receiving 80% of the lost salary for the non-worked hours. Those employees not affected by the solidarity contract resumed working standard working hours. </p>\r\n<p>While restructuring in the main production site and some offices has been implemented through short-time working under the CIGO and more recently by the <i>contratto di solidarietà,</i> restructuring of the smaller production site engaged in molding has been more difficult. In 2011, as the decline in turnover was concentrated in plastic material products, the second production unit was considered no longer profitable and the company was forced to assess its conditions and possible developments. At the beginning the company had considered the possibility of transferring the molding activity to the main production site. This would have resulted in a reduction of costs while safeguarding the affected staff. However, after assessing the level of investments the company would have had to make in the main production site, it became obvious that this was not feasible and economically viable. At this stage, the company was left with the only option to outsource the molding activity and implement a procedure of extraordinary wage guarantee fund (<i>cassa integrazione straordinaria</i> CIGS) for the site which envisaged the stop of production (CIGS zero ore). Under this scheme employees work reduced hours or even no hours (complete stop of production in this case), while receiving income support equal to 80% of their last wage. </p>\r\n<p>On this smaller production site, which as the main site had been under CIGO since May 2009, CIGS started in October 2011 and lasted until the end of September 2012. In October 2012, with the end of the CIGS, the employees of the second site have been dismissed under a mobility procedure. Under this procedure, the dismissed employees are placed in special regional mobility lists, which are special job placement registers compiled to promote the re-engagement of the dismissed employees into the labour market. Under a mobility procedure, the employees also receive income support, if their former employer is eligible for CIGS.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process has required continuous organisational adjustments, both in terms of tasks and roles. This implied a high degree of flexibility to the staff, and also considerable costs to the company, as in order to implement staff rotation, most staff had to be re-trained. This process was the result of agreements with social partners, and efforts have been channeled to ensure skills, competences and professionalism were safeguarded, while at the same time ensuring that the least necessary number of CIGO were used. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenges the company encountered related to access to capital, financing and funding as well as bureaucracy.  Indeed, SMEs’ limited size undermines their bargaining power with banks and financial institutions in accessing finance and credit. SMEs score higher than average failed loan requests or have to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the bank perceived risk. Either way, credit and funding support dries up when most needed and this is highly significant as no investment or restructuring can be implemented without financing and credit. Moreover, despite the restructuring being financed by the CIG (which is itself financed via a contribution that each enterprise pays, in a sort of insurance mechanism), the procedure requires that the income support is anticipated by the company, which will then be reimbursed by the Italian National Social Security Institute (INPS). This reimbursement, however, can be paid up to six months after the implementation. This is an incredible incongruence because it results in a dramatic burden for companies which are already in difficulty. </p>\r\n<p>The employees were informed immediately via their trade union representatives, as prescribed by Italian Law. Quite understandably, at the beginning the employees were concerned, also due to the fact that the majority of employees had been working in the company for a very long time and there had never been a need to implement such a restructuring process in the history of the company. However, these worries and the uncertainty have slightly diminished during the ongoing process, especially once it became clear that the reduction of hours worked concerned only a limited number of hours per employee (eight hours per week during CIGO) implying that there was not any prospect of temporary stoppage to the production or even closure. However, the impact on the employees of the second production site, which effectively stopped production, has been much more dramatic, as their future outlook in the company seems quite negative. </p>\r\n<p>For the owners, the decision to restructure was emotionally very difficult. The company is a family-run business, which has been in the family for three generations. The owners are very bound to the company and the employees, and even if the impact on wages has not been dramatic, thanks to the supply of the CIG and of the solidarity contract, the decision to result to these instruments has been emotionally challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company has been supported in its restructuring process by the local offices of Confindustria (the Italian employers’ organisation for the industry sector), which provided advice and information especially on the social shock absorbers, its procedures and the social dialogue with the other involved actors. The restructuring processes and the different options have been discussed with Confindustria which provided indispensable advice. The company has also been extensively supported by the external consultants that are also responsible for the outsourced administrative activities. The consultants provided detailed information on the different options of restructuring, providing also legal requirements, and expected outcomes and different scenarios of the different restructuring options. </p>\r\n<p>The final decisions however are the sole result of the company decision and they are the result of the social dialogue.</p>\r\n<p>Social dialogue has been very fair, and the main trade union representative has been extremely fair to the company as well as the employees. Employees did not directly participate in the social dialogue, but they did so through the trade unions and the RSU.</p>\r\n<p>The Ministry of Labour as well as the Public Employment Services has not been involved at all. The Ministry of Labour has been only provided with the detailed information on the financial outlook of the company at the time of applying for CIG and solidarity contract as prescribed by the Law. </p>\r\n<p>The company benefited of the economic support provided by the CIG and solidarity contract, which however are based on an assurance mechanism as they are financed companies. According to the company this support has proved vital for the survival of the company.</p>\r\n<p>However, additional economic support to finance the restructuring in terms of costs for the training, and also costs toward the external consultants have been borne by the company. </p>\r\n<p>The advice and support provided by Confindustria is free for all its members.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring had a positive outcome as it enabled the company to face the decline in orders, turnover and profits due to the economic crisis. </p>\r\n<p>The <i>Cassa</i>, in particular, has proved to be indispensable in order to implement the necessary organisational adjustments, while safeguarding employment levels. The company had not established a detailed restructuring plan which analysed the different steps and respective outcomes of the different phases of the restructuring process, but it rather outlined the first phase of the restructuring, while further steps were left for reassessment and renegotiation with social partners, after the period of CIGO (July 2012). By then as staff was still not proportionate to the amount of work and turnover, the company had to resort to the solidarity contract for 51 employees. This allowed an adjustment in terms of output and costs without jeopardising production, quality and employment levels. Those employees not affected by the solidarity contract have resumed working standard hours. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring therefore achieved the intended outcomes, as the company has been able to maintain the high quality standard of its products, while impacting as little as possible on employment. </p>\r\n<p>Nonetheless, outsourcing the molding activity resulted in a loss of specific internal competences; regardless of this loss at products level, competences, know-how and skills as well as quality have been guaranteed.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring also impacted on the owners, and not only in monetary terms, but most for its emotional toll: indeed, never in the history of the company had the owners had to implement any cost-cutting measure. However, the owners firmly believe and stand behind the reasons for restructuring, as after assessing all viable options, they agreed that the specific restructuring implemented was the only feasible process which would have guaranteed the survival of the company. Notably, by implementing short-time working for most of the employees in the offices and the main production site, as well as deciding to stop production and outsource the activity performed in the second smaller production site, the company safeguarded the survival of the company and the job of at least 67 employees. This choice has been excruciating but essential.</p>\r\n<p>The company was not negatively affected by the restructuring event in terms of their network of customers and suppliers. Indeed, given the economic contingencies, restructuring has affected a massive number of firms, and for this reason the negative outcomes on the network of relations in this particular time has not been as negative as it could have been in more positive economic times. </p>\r\n<p>There have also been effects on staff, as due to uncertainty some members of staff have decided to voluntarily leave the company. However, the company believes there are positive outcomes ahead, and it does not foresee any impediments, limits or constraint to the professional and occupational development of its staff.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, the company is actively engaged in developing a strategy to expand its core business to other areas. For this reason the company also foresees an expansion in 2013, which will also require new employment opportunities. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process has not been formally evaluated, neither internally or externally. However, the company strongly argues that, notwithstanding the associated difficulties, the restructuring process has been positive. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring event was deemed positive by the company, which has declared it would implement the exact same restructuring process if it could go back in time, but it would implement it quicker. Indeed, the support of the CIG was deemed essential to implement the restructuring and to provide for the company survival. </p>\r\n<p>The company also declared that the support of Confindustria and the positive and fruitful social dialogue which resulted in the restructuring agreement, have positively contributed to the successful outcome of the restructuring. The fair process of social dialogue has also encouraged a calm and polite environment within the company and in the relations with the management. Indeed while at the beginning affected employees were understandably worried about their uncertain prospects, with time they have understood and supported the reasons for restructuring</p>\r\n<p>The company identified access to credit and financing as the main challenge to restructuring and investment/innovation. Indeed, no investment or restructuring can be implemented without funding, financing and credit. However, due to their limited size generally SMEs face more constraints in securing capital, funding and financing opportunities than their larger counterparts. This is even more dramatic during times of crisis, when funding opportunities are extremely limited.</p>\r\n<p>Also bureaucracy (both in terms of legislation and in terms of length of social dialogue) imposes a burden on companies needing to implement process of restructuring. In particular, the delay in INPS’ reimbursement of the income support imposes a damaging economic burden to companies already negatively affected by difficult economic conditions. . </p>\r\n<p>The company argues that the main difference in SMEs’ restructuring, compared to larger companies, lies in the possibility of delocating towards countries supplying cheaper labour and in easier criteria to access credit, financing and funding opportunities. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Lidia Salvatore, Eurofound</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources </h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interview</h3>\r\n<p>One of the company owners who is also the CEO</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3>\r\n<p>Eurofound (2010), Italy: <i>Wage guarantee fund, solidarity agreements, bilateral bodies and wage guarantee fund in derogation</i>, available at  <a HREF=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef10636.htm"">http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef10636.htm</a></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Italy"~"31 - manufacture of furniture"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"recession/crisis"~"internal restructuring"~"2011-11-25"
"	Golden Harvest, Malta"~"Golden Harvest Company Ltd."~"<p>Maltese producer of baked goods Golden Harvest in 2008 relocated its operations out of a residential area to a new site in an industrial zone. The new bakery was larger, and it better met the company’s needs for greater efficiency. To ensure a smooth transition of operations without disturbing productivity, a migration plan was implemented and carried out over a 60-day period. Following the transition, the company embarked on a restructuring of its internal management. Since the move, the company has seen a gradual increase in turnover and a rise in the number of full-time employees.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The name Golden Harvest is synonymous in Malta with the manufacture of freshly baked bread, pastry goods and cakes, and ice-cream. The company traces its origin back to a modest traditional bakery set up in the small village of Floriana back in 1946. It did not take long for the reputation of this small bakery to spread beyond the confines of the small local community; and in a short time, consumers were able to purchase its goods, in particular its unconventional fancy bread, from various village shops across Malta. </p>\r\n<p>By 1949, the company employed 20 workers and introduced new baked goods to its production lines. As its customer base continued to grow, the next logical step was to shift its operations to a larger facility which would accommodate the needs of a growing business.  The new factory began to operate from the town of Gżira, now under the name of ‘Golden Harvest’.</p>\r\n<p>Between 1952 and 1958, the company invested in more machinery and introduced the first spiral mixers to the local market. New silos and moving tunnel ovens which led to an automated line were introduced in 1964. This allowed for the introduction of new baked goods to its production line, such as the popular French Slice and Slimex, appealing to the more weight-conscious consumer.</p>\r\n<p>The company continues to use the latest technology to offer Maltese consumers a wide variety of baked products. Golden Harvest also continues to ensure that time-honoured Maltese bakery and confectionary items remain on their production schedules using traditional recipes. The company also provides finished goods and pre-mixes to order and have been entrusted by companies and large fast-food outlets, restaurants and hotels to produce their products under licence. Together with its traditional confectionary items, the company also sells frozen foods and seasonal items.</p>\r\n<p>A fundamental rule by which the company continues to abide is that whatever the situation, there should be no compromise on quality standards. Golden Harvest strives to maintain high quality standards in its operations to consistently deliver the best products to its customers. This is achieved through its highly trained quality assurance staff, who effectively monitor that all BRC (British Retailers Consortium) procedures are followed through each stage of production. This procedure incorporates a systematic, preventative approach to food safety that addresses physical, chemical and biological hazards.</p>\r\n<p>Six decades down the line, Golden Harvest has remained a family-run business which has reached its third generation all of whom are key members of the company’s management, as well as Board of Directors. </p>\r\n<p>Mark Aquilina was appointed Chief Executive Officer at Golden Harvest Ltd. in June 2011. As a member of the family and a firm believer in the continued success of the company, Mr Aquilina was involved in the operations of the business at a relatively young age. Indeed, He has been involved in the business for over 22 years and prior to his appointment as CEO of the company, already served as a member of the Board of Directors. Throughout the years, Mr Aquilina has gathered a wealth of experience in the management and operations of the company which allows him to administer the day-to-day running of the business and set out projections for future growth.</p>\r\n<p>Renewed investment continues to be injected into the company, producing on average 70,000 products each day. The company owns a fleet of 23 vehicles and delivers to 14 direct distribution branches and over 1,000 retail outlets daily across the Maltese islands. Its branch stores are independently run by store managers who oversee every aspect of the business. Notwithstanding, any restructuring which would impact the company’s business activities would need to be conferred with the Board of Directors for approval.</p>\r\n<p>As of spring 2012, the company employs 143 full-time employees. The skills employed by the company include amongst others; accountants, delivery men and electronic operators. </p>\r\n<p>Almost 100% of the company’s production is produced for the local market, with only a fraction of its production line intended for export.</p>\r\n<p>Management strives to promote and maintain good industrial relations with its employees.  In so doing, it promotes active measures such as staff training and development which helps stimulate further development and motivation on the job and consequently increase the average skill level of the company. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>In 2008, Golden Harvest Ltd. moved into a new bakery in the industrial zone of San Ġwann. The inauguration of the new premises marked the successful completion of the company’s long-term plan to relocate out of its former plant in Gżira – which due to developments in building construction in the area throughout the years found itself located at the centre of what eventually became a residential area. The relocation also served to accommodate a larger, more functional factory layout which would support the growing demands of the factory facilitating greater efficiency. The management also sought to ensure that the changes implemented in the new factory set-up, such as equipment design and procedures, complied with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) certified standards.</p>\r\n<p>Following the establishment of a fully-fledged bakery plant, the company also embarked on a restructuring of its internal management structure. The change embraced the appointment of Mark Aquilina as Chief Executive Officer and the assigning of other members of the family to key management posts.  The changes introduced to the management structure came about as part of a family succession planning exercise, executed and agreed upon by the Board of Directors, composed mainly of family members.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The idea to relocate the operations of the factory to a new site outside of Gżira dates back to 1999. The construction of a new building, to be designed and tailored for the specific operational and physical capacity of the company, was considered to be the single most viable option. </p>\r\n<p>Once the decision was taken by the Board of Directors to push forward with this project, the company started to carry out the necessary research which would form the basis of what would be a solid Business Plan for the company’s restructuring process. The plan also included a feasibility study, an architectural plan, engineers’ report and a design and layout for the new production line.</p>\r\n<p>The site which was to host the new factory was acquired through Malta Industrial Parks, the corporation responsible for the administration and maintenance of industrial estates in Malta. The new factory was to be located approximately 5km away from the old factory site. By January 2007, work on the new premises started to progress at a steady pace, and in December 2008 the company inaugurated the opening of its fully-fledged plant in San Ġwann. The factory was built on the site of what was an old factory. The old building was subsequently demolished and became the site of the new Golden Harvest factory. The site was acquired through Malta Industrial Parks, an organisation created to manage industrial estates in Malta.</p>\r\n<p>The new plant represented an investment of over €20 million supported through equity and bank financing. Management claims that given the good standing which the company enjoys with its bank, no major difficulties were encountered during negotiations on the financing of the project. </p>\r\n<p>Employees and suppliers were informed in advance of the relocation to the new plant. In order to ensure a smooth transition of the plants’ operations without disturbing productivity, a migration plan was implemented and carried out over a 60-day period. The new factory started to operate trial runs, which required mainly production line workers to work extra shifts over the 60 day period, until all employees completed the necessary training to be able to operate the new machinery. Specialised training on the new machinery was provided on-site by the supplier. Operation from the new plant continued to work in parallel with on-going work from the old plant until the full migration of its operations was complete. This was done in order not to disrupt productivity and supply for the local market.  Only small pieces of equipment were transferred to the new plant, with most machinery from the old plant sold to a foreign buyer. The old plant remains the property of Golden Harvest Ltd.; however it is currently not in operation.</p>\r\n<p>A different approach was adopted with some of the administrative staff of the company, who was asked to translocate to the new premises at short notice, claiming that not enough time was allowed for them to see to the shifting of most of their archives. Other than the mentioned hitch in relation to the short notification period applied to some members of staff, the overall experience of the restructuring process was viewed to be a positive one. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The inauguration of a new and more sophisticated factory marked another milestone achievement for Golden Harvest Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>Like any other large-scale project, the process had its fair share of challenges. The project involved a list of deliverables which needed to be met by the project team, such as the gradual migration of employees to the new premises whilst at the same time providing them with the necessary training required in order to be able to operate the new machinery. In order to meet the projections set out in the Business Plan, the management engaged the services of an external management consultant to sit with the Board of Directors; a legal officer; financial and business consultants and a civil engineer. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The company attributes the success of the project to good planning, which ultimately makes the implementation process easier. The ability to guarantee quantifiable results for a project in advance is a way of staving off any undesirable impact on the company’s operations, finance and employees. </p>\r\n<p>By engaging a team of experts which would assist in the planning and implementation of the project, and developing a sound Business Plan for its undertaking, Golden Harvest Ltd. managed to avoid certain constraints which could have been detrimental to the successful outcome of the project. Management did not consider cost to be a real factor when evaluating the engagement of experts for this project. </p>\r\n<p>Golden Harvest Ltd. has also benefited from Government incentives such as interest rate subsidies which offer support to new investment projects undertaken by enterprises engaged in manufacturing. Other favourable incentives include Government subsidies on investment projects supporting renewable energy, which was an integral concept of the designs of the new factory premises.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Golden Harvest has continued to register a growth in turnover, which is conducive to the continued investment injected into the company. </p>\r\n<p>Following the restructuring project, Golden Harvest also experienced a gradual increase in the number of full-time employees. At the beginning of the restructuring process the number of full-time employees stood at 106. By spring 2012 the company expanded its operations, and employs a workforce of 143 full-time employees. As part of the new operational arrangements which came about from relocation to the new premises, the company also introduced changes to its human resource set up in order to enhance the value added of the company. These changes were mainly applied to key personnel performing production and administrative functions, including sales, marketing and finance. Such changes would ensure that key functions and responsibilities were allocated to the right individuals according to their competence. </p>\r\n<p>The introduction of new cutting-edge technology for its machinery resulted in an increase in operational efficiency and an initial cut in employees’ overtime. However, over the period 2010 and 2011, Golden Harvest continued to witness an expansion in its production line which came about as a response to accelerating growth in product demand. This led to the re-introduction of overtime shifts for its employees.</p>\r\n<p>The new bakery, which is spread over 14,500 square metres of space, is powered by 16,000 KVA transformers and houses a large cold room that can store up to 1,100 pallets and nine loading bays. The new space also incorporates two new production lines for loaf production and a bun line that provide 100% of additional capacity over the old plant. The building has also been designed to accommodate any future expansion of the company. </p>\r\n<p>Another outcome of the restructuring process is the improvement in cost structure. For Golden Harvest Ltd, the concept ‘going green’ translates into energy efficient technology which ensures environmental quality. This concept was a key element in the design of its sustainable high-end factory. The new structure was designed and built in close collaboration with an internationally renowned foreign bakery management consultancy firm which supervised the works from beginning to end.</p>\r\n<p>Design for environment is a concept which was integrated into the company’s business plans for the new factory. The bakery incorporates a photovoltaic system, together with a solar water-heating system which supplies hot water throughout the building, a modern waste separation system and a large water reservoir that has a capacity to store 96,000 gallons of rain water for every four inches of rainfall. The water is then purified through a reverse osmosis system and used for second class water. Moreover, all oven burners use LPG gas, thereby reducing emissions and contributing towards a greener environment.</p>\r\n<p>Today, the measures implemented by the company translate into a 20% drop in the factory’s energy uptake. A surge in the country’s utility rates has neutralised, rather than cut down on the factory’s cost savings on energy. Notwithstanding, had the company opted not to invest in green technology, the company would today have experienced a 20% increase in utility costs.</p>\r\n<p>Future plans for the company include increasing its production for export. The company is also investing in research and development, seeking to extend the shelf life of its products and introduce a healthier product range on the market, such as baked goods which have low gluten content. The company has also recently launched a Low Gi Multiseed Loaf containing a major source of fibre and is therefore ideal for healthy eaters, dieters, vegetarians and type 2 diabetics who follow a low Gi diet. This product was developed by Bakels (UK) and is produced under license by Golden Harvest.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary </h2>\r\n<p>The management at Golden Harvest Ltd. believe that the root of their success in the restructuring process lies in the time and energy invested in developing a well-structured plan – together with ambition, which is the driving force behind its achievements.</p>\r\n<p>Two significant decisions taken by the company include: the drafting and implementation of a Business Plan which clearly sets out the marketing, operational and financial plan in relation to the project. The plan also includes clearly defined targets and deliverables set out to be achieved by the company.</p>\r\n<p>By investing in a team of experts with distinct professional backgrounds, Golden Harvest Ltd. increased its chances of project success, avoiding any pitfalls which could have resulted in a less desirable outcome.</p>\r\n<p>On a general note, respondents remarked positively on the assistance available for helping SMEs and micro enterprises in Malta to invest in their economic growth. A shared perception was that larger companies tend to garner more interest and backing from Government due to their higher productivity and export share, and their sustenance of a larger workforce.</p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, it is felt that the importance given to larger companies does not significantly outweigh the collective strength and contribution of SMEs to the sustainability of the local economy. A shared perception which emerged during the interviews is the awareness of Government incentives which aim to assist and promote the growth and sustainability of SMEs on the islands. In particular, respondents mentioned assistance offered to small businesses through Malta Enterprise, such as the interest rate subsidy scheme. Other incentives include the promotion of investment in renewable energy, such as subsidies on the installation of solar water heaters and photovoltaic panels. </p>\r\n<p>Another observation made during the interviews was the need for more on-going dialogue and guidance relating to the assistance available to local SMEs, in particular, access to finance.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Claudine Borg, Europa Research and Consultancy Services Ltd.

"IT companies, Luxembourg"~"IT companies"~"<p>This Luxembourg-based group operating in the IT sector began as a web development company. It subsequently developed a new product, payment services by SMS for phone-based goods. This activity was spun off into a new company in 2006. The process was relatively informal and smooth, but planning did take place to carry out the legal steps involved. Communication with staff was aided by having a workers’ representative, and the coming changes were communicated by way of meetings organised on a regular basis. The outcome of the restructuring event has been positive and group turnover steadily increased following the split.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Company A is a company active in the IT sector, more specifically in payment services. It is the sister company of Company B, both companies being held by a management company, Company C, whose shareholders are three individuals, all partners of Company A, including the interviewed General Manager. Company B is held 100% by Company C; Company A is held 66% by Company C, and 33% by a private individual. The holding company does not have operational activities. It has a few employees, providing administrative and accounting services to its subsidiaries.  </p>\r\n<p>Company B was created in 1999 as a web agency (design, development and operation of websites). Over the years, Company B developed a new product, payment services by SMS for phone-based goods such as logos, ring tones and games. As these new activities were of a very different nature than those of a web agency, Company B’s new activities were split off into a new company, Company A, as a spin-off in 2006. This is the ‘restructuring event’ for the purpose of the present case study. In 2009, a subsidiary was created in France, Company D.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, the group of companies (B and A) and their French subsidiary had approximately 43 employees. (It should be noted that two additional companies, Company E and Company F, were created within the group in July 2012, with some  employees of Company A moved to Company F.) </p>\r\n<p>The company does not deal with trade unions but has an employee representative. The average age of the workforce of the group is low (upper 20s). The workforce is composed of men almost exclusively, especially for pure IT functions. Most employees hold a university degree or a vocational training diploma. Approximately 10% of the activities (sales) of Company A are outside Luxembourg. </p>\r\n<p>The group has a brief corporate charter, taking the form of some slides setting out the values, mission statement and vision of the group. The core values are independence, autonomy and responsibility because, according to the General Manager, a company of this size cannot afford any lack of responsibility. </p>\r\n<p>Before the split, the turnover of Company B was approximately €500,000 a year. Following the split, the combined turnover of companies A and B steadily increased to reach €4.5 million in 2011. </p>\r\n<p>Company A is currently (first half of 2012) contemplating a diversification of its production chain, which is not part of the restructuring event mentioned above and not further described for confidentiality reasons (the ‘new restructuring event’). This new diversification, which will result in the creation of another new company within the group, is nonetheless interesting and we refer to it below.  </p>\r\n<p>The General Manager interviewed for the purpose of the present case study holds an IT diploma from a German technical university as well as a master’s degree in European business from a leading French business college. He has two years of international experience as a software engineer at IBM in the US. He joined Company A in 2006, on its creation. He and the two other partners at Company A have known and worked with each other for many years in the past. They met as they high school students and had developed and managed a successful chat platform in Luxembourg. The three partners at Company A therefore know each other very well.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The General Manager identifies several triggers to the restructuring event: </p>\r\n<p>•	willingness to separate two activities of different natures; </p>\r\n<p>•	the arrival of two new shareholders/partners, including the interviewed General Manager; </p>\r\n<p>•	some market opportunities in Luxembourg that were spotted by the management of Company A at the time, which was relatively easy to do due to the small size of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The General Manager describes the process as overall informal/spontaneous. There was nonetheless a minimal degree of planning which consisted of carrying out the legal steps to plan and implement the split (drafting articles of association, assessing the value of assets for determining the remuneration of shareholders, notary deed, and the like). </p>\r\n<p>This was decided and implemented by the three owners of the firm, with some limited external support (see below). The General Manager describes the process as facilitated essentially by the fact that one of the three partners had a legal background, which meant they did not have to rely on external expertise. Moreover, the important decisions (including those on finance) were made quickly due to the small number of people around the table.</p>\r\n<p> The restructuring event was based on the company’s own funds. The company obtained a credit line from a bank but never activated it. </p>\r\n<p>After the decision had been taken, all contracts with customers and suppliers had to be updated, which took a number of months. As only the names on the contracts had to be changed, it was quite a smooth process. Employment contracts with employees also had to be updated to move them from one company to the other.</p>\r\n<p>Communication with the workforce was intense, constant and informal as there were few people in the company at the time. People were informed about the coming changes, the timing and the conditions for change, by way of meetings organised on a regular basis.  The General Manager notes that having a workers’ representative is useful on several accounts, notably for sounding out the employees’ reaction to ongoing change and for communicating difficult messages, such as organisational changes, which do not always please everyone. Regarding the new restructuring process, the management continues to seek the opinion of the workers’ representative on a regular basis. Communication with employees is more formal today than it used to be in the past, before and during the restructuring process, notably with the use of official communication emails. </p>\r\n<p>At the time, the three partners decided to restructure, Company B had eight employees (management included). At the time of the restructuring implementation, it had 12 employees (including management). A handful of them  were requested to join Company A, including the General Manager, partner, director and one of the three owners of Company A. Regarding the operational transfer of activities from B to A, since the people working on the project were also migrated to the new company, the operational business did not change much more than using a different email address.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The General Manager does not identify challenges the group specifically encountered during the restructuring process, which, according to him, went very well. Generally speaking, he believes that the main difficulty SMEs face while restructuring is limited financial support due to their size, for example for developing new innovative products or processes or for obtaining credit lines.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The General Manager reports having used the services of one external expert, an auditor, to assess the value of the company. One of the partners has a law degree and this person provided most of the legal input for the process. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Overall, the outcome of the restructuring event is positive and group turnover steadily increased following the split.</p>\r\n<p>As far as the other two owners are concerned, the organisation and distribution of work has changed following the split, with the arrival of two new shareholders, including the interviewed General Manager. Distribution of work was no longer implicit, which meant that, with the restructuring event, for the first time they had to do a formal division of work. ime was needed for adjusting to this and for consolidating trust among the new directors. </p>\r\n<p>The General Manager took over management functions that are very different from those he had in his previous job, where he was an employee in a large group with no real impact on the company’s decision-making. One reason he opted for this change was in fact being able to have some real impact on the company’s direction and activities and he seems to derive great satisfaction from this. </p>\r\n<p>The arrival of the General Manager diversified the profile of the management. He is the only one of the three partners having a technical background, the others having respectively a legal and a communication and marketing background. This new skill in the management is of course useful for business development as the company operates in a highly technical sector. Following the split and to date both companies are still sharing offices, so there remains a lot of interaction between the employees. There is an intense exchange of knowledge between the two companies and A is using B for web development jobs frequently.</p>\r\n<p>As far as employees are concerned, the General Manager believes that the group has more means to help them after the restructuring event than before: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>more funds for increasing salaries where required;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>more flexibility regarding packages (such as company\r\ncars); </li>\r\n<li>more possibility for ad hoc training. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The General Manager says that this is, however, related to the increasing revenues arising from the expanded activities of the companies rather than to the restructuring event itself.</p>\r\n<p> Finally, implementing the restructuring event had some positive impact on human resources management, allowing the group management to refine their recruiting process. This is because numerous employees were hired in or mainly after the process. The management team itself carried out the hiring process and gained knowledge from it. The General Manager believes that as a result their hiring skills are better now than in the before the restructuring event.</p>\r\n<p>Today, none of the eight employees initially employed by Company B remains within the group of companies. The General Manger explains that this high departure rate is essentially due to the fact that the companies used to be (and to some extent still are) small companies, employing young staff and that as these people mature professionally they tend to leave for new professional challenges.  </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>One advantage SMEs have over large firms in implementing change, according to the General Manager, is their agility. Large corporations implement change more slowly due to heavy reporting lines and complex decision-making procedures, whereas things are more informal within SMEs, which he says is ‘priceless’.</p>\r\n<p>He notes that communication is currently more formal with respect to the new restructuring event, due to the fact that there are many more employees in the group than in the past. </p>\r\n<p>In relation to the new restructuring event, the General Manager sees it positive that the group benefitted from subsidies granted by the Luxembourg government for R&amp;D. Without these subsidies, it would not have been possible for Company A to dedicate some staff to working full time on the development of the new product, including hiring new employees for that purpose. The subsidies also allowed them to develop the new product in a more structured way. An additional positive he sees is the active policy of the Luxembourg government to support intellectual property-related activities by exempting from taxes some of these activities. Company A is directly benefitting from this policy and the General Manager sees it as a positive for SMEs and innovation in general. In  his view SMEs are the heart of innovation (they innovate while large groups buy innovative small companies). </p>\r\n<p>Finally, the General Manager notes that most of the information in the present report is related to the continuous growth undergone by the group. The restructuring event described above is a means, among others, that was used for facilitating and implementing this continuous growth.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Cécile Musialski, Philippe &amp; Partners.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews </h3>\r\n<p>General Manager and partner in Company A</p>\r\n<p><i>Note: </i></p>\r\n<p>The present case study is not based on any employee interview as no employee who worked in the group prior to the restructuring event remains within the group today.    </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Luxembourg"~"62 - computer programming, consultancy and related activities"~"10-49"~"10-49"~NULL~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2012-06-12"
"Jo’Burger, Ireland"~"Jo'Burger"~"<p>Irish firm Jo&rsquo;Burger faced financial difficulties due to loans given to other companies of the same owners/managers that could not be repaid. The insolvent company went through examinership, a formal process to restructure the firm. In this process, the company found a new investor and reached an agreement with creditors to write off some of the debts. All existing jobs were retained and, about two to three years later, the company had opened additional branches resulting in considerable employment growth.</p>"~"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The Macken family incorporated Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd as a private limited company in 2006 to set up and run the Jo&rsquo;Burger restaurant in Rathmines, a suburb of Dublin. Husband and wife Kevin and Vonie Macken had previously and successfully operated a hotel in a small village near Dublin that they sold in 2000. While on a visit to London, Kevin and his son Joe became aware of the growing trend towards gourmet burger restaurants and decided to set one up in Dublin.</p>\r\n<p>All three Mackens became directors of the company although only Kevin and Joe were actively involved in the running of the business. The company started trading in 2007 and proved to be immediately popular, with its innovative menu comprising of a range of South African-themed gourmet burgers, named after districts in Johannesburg. The restaurant won numerous awards including <em>The Dubliner</em> magazine People&rsquo;s Choice Restaurant of the Year 2008.</p>\r\n<p>Jo&rsquo;Burger, in addition to its reputation as a provider of good quality food at economical prices, also made effective use of social media (Facebook and Twitter) to promote its offerings.</p>\r\n<p>In 2008, the Mackens set up another company, Blackrock JJB Ltd, to open and run a second Jo&rsquo;Burger restaurant in Blackrock, another suburb of Dublin. Blackrock JJB which had 20 employees was completely separate from Jo&rsquo;Burger Lt even though it had the same directors.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to setting up Jo&rsquo;Burger, the Mackens had in 2003 incorporated another company, Orange Square Ltd, which operated gourmet sandwiches take-away shops at two separate locations in Dublin city centre and which employed 10 people.</p>\r\n<p>At the time of the restructuring, Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd was trading profitably and had 15 employees. The employees in Jo&rsquo;Burger were mostly young, were both male and female and were not members of any trade union. Given the active involvement of Kevin and Joe Macken in the running of Jo&rsquo;Burger and the fact that a number of them had other family relations (brothers, sisters) working in the restaurant, the employees had a real sense that this was a &lsquo;family&rsquo; business.</p>\r\n<p>As Jo&rsquo;Burger was a new and small company it did not have any formal HR policies; nor did it have a works council.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>Jo'Burger Ltd got into financial trouble during the period 2008&ndash;2009 arising from loans worth &euro;500,000 it had given to two other firms set up by the Mackens, Orange Square Ltd and Blackrock JJB Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>The attempt to set up the second branch of Jo&rsquo;Burger in Blackrock, under the Blackrock JJB banner, was not successful. The building that Blackrock JJB rented was too large to create the intimate atmosphere that made the Rathmines restaurant successful and, secondly, it was not in a good location to attract sufficient passing traffic.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, there were question marks over the long-term commercial viability of the two gourmet sandwich shops that Orange Square operated. The difficulties with Orange Square have been attributed to a combination of an invalid marketing strategy (a wrong product and target market), and planning issues, which had a negative impact on cash flow.</p>\r\n<p>The cash requirements of both Blackrock JJB and Orange Square placed a heavy financial burden on the Mackens who were in danger of losing their life savings. Even though Jo&rsquo;Burger in Rathmines was profitable, it was not earning enough to stem the losses arising from their other two companies. As Blackrock JJB and Orange Square were unable to repay the loans that Jo&rsquo;Burger had made to them, Jo&rsquo;Burger itself was having difficulties in paying its own creditors.</p>\r\n<p>As the Mackens operated a lean and flat organisational structure &ndash; Kevin and Joe Macken were effectively the management team for all three companies &ndash; the difficulties in Blackrock JJB and Orange Square absorbed an enormous amount of their time.</p>\r\n<p>Technically, the Mackens should have set up a holding company to link the three companies, Jo&rsquo;Burger, Orange Square and Blackrock JJB, as a formal group. The provision of loans by Jo&rsquo;Burger to the other two companies without a formal holding company structure being put in place meant that it unintentionally breached Section 31 of the Companies Act. (Section 31 of the Companies Act 1990 prohibits companies from entering into certain types of transactions, which would otherwise be lawful, for the benefit of a director or a party connected with a director. It seeks, among other things, to prevent a company giving a loan to another company that is owned or connected with a director of the company.)</p>\r\n<p>An independent review of their businesses in 2009 indicated that there was little chance of recovering much of the money that Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd had lent to Blackrock JJB and Orange Square. It also showed that Jo&rsquo;Burger owed approximately &euro;250,000 in Value Added Tax, PAYE (income tax deduction) and PRSI (social insurance) to the Revenue Commissioners, the Irish tax authorities, and &euro;100,000 to trade creditors.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>Aware that the financial difficulties of Blackrock JJB and Orange Square were putting a huge pressure on their one profitable company in terms of paying its creditors, the Mackens sought to explore all the options available to them. They sought the advice of an accountant who had been recommended to them. Then, through a trade contact, Joe Macken became aware of a legal process, examinership, which potentially could be used to save Jo&rsquo;Burger.</p>\r\n<p>Examinership, which has parallels with Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, is a formal corporate recovery process designed to save fundamentally good companies and the jobs they provide. Essentially, an insolvent company that goes into examinership is protected by the High Court for up to 100 days as it attempts to restructure its cost base, renegotiate or exit from onerous leases and put in place a scheme of arrangement with its creditors.</p>\r\n<p>The examinership process is managed by an outside party known as the examiner, who is usually a practising accountant. Entering examinership is, for example, the only way in Irish law outside of receivership or liquidation that a company can, for example, hand back an onerous leasehold interest to a landlord. The appointment of an examiner is an option available to insolvent companies in Ireland since 1990.</p>\r\n<p>The High Court has to be satisfied that in providing protection to a company it has a reasonable prospect of being successfully restructured. Another important aspect of the process is that the examiner will seek to attract new investment into the company.In September 2009, the directors of Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd petitioned the High Court for the appointment of an examiner to the company as a result of demands from the Revenue Commissioners and trade creditors for the money owed to them. Because it was unable to pay its debts, Jo&rsquo;Burger was insolvent. Jo&rsquo;Burger&rsquo;s creditors could seek to liquidate the company in order to recover the money owed to them, so the examinership process was an option available to the directors to gain time to see if new investment could be obtained and/or a write-down of the company&rsquo;s debts could be agreed to save its survival.</p>\r\n<p>In their application to enter the examinership process, the directors of Jo&rsquo;Burger informed the High Court that the company would cease to trade in the absence of the protection of the court. The High Court was also told that Jo&rsquo;Burger had an excess of liabilities over assets of &euro;677,000 and it was estimated that if it was liquidated, there would be a total deficit of approximately &euro;770,000 owed to creditors.</p>\r\n<p>Jo&rsquo;Burger&rsquo;s legal counsel told the High Court that an independent accountant&rsquo;s report commissioned by the company had indicated it had a reasonable prospect of survival if a scheme of arrangement &ndash; including additional investment and a write-down of its debts &ndash; could be put in place.</p>\r\n<p>The judge agreed that Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd had a reasonable prospect of survival and had only got into difficulties arising from the loans it had provided to Blackrock JJB and Orange Square. He appointed Neil Hughes as examiner of Jo&rsquo;Burger in order to determine its potential for survival.</p>\r\n<p>The examinership gave Jo&rsquo;Burger a 100-day breathing space that allowed Mr Hughes to explore all options for its future survival. He issued an information memorandum to attract new investors into the company so as to make it viable again. He also sought the agreement of creditors to write down some of the debt owned by Jo&rsquo;Burger.</p>\r\n<p>The Jo&rsquo;Burger restaurant continued to trade in Rathmines during the examinership process. Kevin and Joe Macken provided information to their staff on examinership and told them that it was very likely that the restaurant would continue to trade following the examinership process because it was profitable and had a viable future. The Mackens told them that they should continue working normally but emphasised the need to maintain a high level of customer service in order to retain the restaurant&rsquo;s customer base.</p>\r\n<p>The employees in Jo&rsquo;Burger were aware of the difficulties that the Mackens were experiencing and knew that the expansion to Blackrock had not been successful. Other clues gleaned by staff were demands from suppliers to be paid in cash.</p>\r\n<p>Although the decision to place Jo&rsquo;Burger in examinership was covered in the national and social media and the restaurant had to close for one day (to facilitate a stock take so that a financial statement of affairs could be produced for the court), Jo&rsquo;Burger continued to be as busy as ever. This to some extent meant that the employees in Jo&rsquo;Burger were shielded from the activities associated with the examinership process. Given the family atmosphere and the close communications that existed in the restaurant, they had, however, concerns both for their own jobs and for the Mackens.</p>\r\n<p>The examinership process allowed Mr Hughes to:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; secure new investment for Jo&rsquo;Burger (he had decided to accept the offer from John Roberts, one of 10 potential investors that had expressed an interest in investing in the company);</p>\r\n<p>&bull; reach agreement with its creditors for a write-down of the debts that it owed them (the company&rsquo;s unsecured creditors agreed to a reduction of 90% of what had been due to them and the Revenue Commissioners agreed to an 80% write-down)</p>\r\n<p>The new investor, Mr Roberts, agreed to put money into the company and to join the management team. He also became the majority shareholder in Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd.</p>\r\n<p>The examiner presented these proposals for the survival of Jo&rsquo;Burger &ndash; the new investment and the debt write-down &ndash; to the High Court in December 2009. The High Court approved these and Jo&rsquo;Burger was able to emerge from the restructuring process with the jobs of all 15 employees intact.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The examinership process was an especially difficult and traumatic time for the Mackens (Joe Macken says it was like &lsquo;a death in the family&rsquo;). While the Mackens were convinced that Jo&rsquo;Burger as a restaurant would survive the restructuring process, there was no guarantee that they would have a future role in the business (a new investor could say, for example, that they did not want the Mackens to have any future involvement in Jo&rsquo;Burger). They were worried that in addition to losing their livelihood they would also lose the significant amounts of their own money they had invested in Jo&rsquo;Burger, Orange Square and Blackrock JJB.</p>\r\n<p>On the first day of the examinership process, September 9th, 2009 (&lsquo;<em>9-9-9&rsquo;</em> as Joe Macken labels it), the Mackens in addition to informing their employees also had to personally visit all of their suppliers &ndash; some of whom were located outside Dublin &ndash; to explain the examinership decision, and to seek their continued support. The Mackens had to persuade their suppliers to continue supplying Jo&rsquo;Burger even though they might be nervous doing so given that there was a lot of uncertainty about the company&rsquo;s long-term survival. Trade creditors would also have been worried that they might not get paid for the goods they had already supplied (as noted above, trade creditors agreed to a payment by Jo&rsquo;Burger of 10 cents for every euro it owed them).</p>\r\n<p>Later on in the examinership process, the Mackens had to respond to the many queries submitted about their business by the 10 or so interested parties who had submitted bids to invest in Jo&rsquo;Burger in response to the information memorandum issued by the examiner. As the examinership process was managed by the examiner, Mr Hughes, the Mackens had no direct input into the evaluation of the bids received or into the negotiations with creditors.</p>\r\n<p>Asked about the events leading up to the restructuring process, Joe Macken had this to say in an interview with <em>The Irish Times</em> in 2012:</p>\r\n<p><em>&lsquo;We got it wrong, and we went through examinership and there was a lot of pain involved for us and [for our] suppliers. My business partner, John Roberts, came on board and it gave us a new release and we kept most of our suppliers. The banks, who used to hate us, like us now. We spend all the money internally on our businesses. None of us have flash cars or houses. I go around on a bicycle &mdash; the rented ones.&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and supportKevin and Joe Macken were acutely aware of the seriousness of their financial situation during the period 2008&ndash;2009. They knew that there was a danger that even though Jo&rsquo;Burger was trading profitably it could be pulled down by the losses in their other companies, particularly Blackrock JJB.</h2>\r\n<p>The Mackens sought advice from the accountants who prepared the accounts for Jo&rsquo;Burger but their regular advisor was not available. They were then given the name of another accountant who they understood had experience of helping companies that had gotten into financial difficulties.</p>\r\n<p>The Mackens&rsquo; experience with this accountant was not a happy one. The advice he gave them was not helpful (he recommended that they liquidate the company) and to compound matters he sought a large fee for his services.</p>\r\n<p>Through his connections in the hospitality trade, Joe Macken became aware of the plight of the company running a well-known Dublin restaurant which was under the protection of the courts. His visit to the owners &ndash; who were ultimately unsuccessful in their examinership &ndash; gave Mr Macken the impetus to find out more about the examinership process.</p>\r\n<p>He then made contact with Mr Hughes of the accountancy firm Hughes Blake, an acknowledged expert on examinership. He invited Mr Hughes to a meal in Jo&rsquo;Burger and when he had reviewed the restaurant&rsquo;s situation, he told Mr Macken that examinership would be a good option for the company.</p>\r\n<p>The new investor in Jo&rsquo;Burger and its chief executive, John Roberts, said this about the examinership process:</p>\r\n<p><em>&lsquo;We are more than happy to be discussed as a case study to support the advantages of examinership. It is an enlightened piece of legislation, which few people understand.&rsquo; </em></p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Over the course of the 100-day protection process, Mr Roberts agreed to invest over &euro;100,000 in the company. He became the majority shareholder in Jo&rsquo;Burger and also agreed to provide loans to the company. Mr Roberts became a director of Jo&rsquo;Burger and replaced Joe Macken as secretary of the company. He acts as the financial manager of the company.</p>\r\n<p>After the scheme was approved by the High Court Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd began 2010 with all 15 jobs intact (there were no redundancies and no employee left the company) and all historic creditors fully discharged through the scheme of arrangement.</p>\r\n<p>Both of the Mackens&rsquo; other two companies, Orange Square and Blackrock JJB, which had not been part of the examinership process were liquidated with the loss of 30 jobs.</p>\r\n<p>Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd continues to operate its gourmet burger restaurant in Rathmines and has since set up three new restaurants, Crackbird, Skinflint and Bear. Employment in the company has grown to 95 people and there are plans to increase this to 140. The employees in Jo&rsquo;Burger have not only been able to retain their jobs but the growth of the company has allowed them to achieve supervisory/management positions (one interviewee joined Jo&rsquo;Burger as a waitress and is now a supervisor in one of the company&rsquo;s new restaurants).</p>\r\n<p>The employees believe the examinership process has benefited Jo&rsquo;Burger by bringing in not only the additional financial investment but also the skills and experience of Mr Roberts. The employees see Mr Roberts&rsquo;s skill sets in management, marketing and finance as being a complement to Joe Macken&rsquo;s creative vision and energy. They feel that the business now operates on a more structured basis and are more confident about the future of Jo&rsquo;Burger.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Jo&rsquo;Burger is a good example of a small company that was profitable and has been saved from liquidation and the loss of 15 employees because of losses sustained by other enterprises owned by the owners of the company. Jo&rsquo;Burger was able to enter examinership, a court-supervised corporate recovery process, under which it received the protection of the courts for up to 100 days that gave it the breathing space to explore all opportunities for its survival.</p>\r\n<p>The examinership process proved successful for Jo&rsquo;Burger. Not only was it able to survive but it actually increased its employment from 15 employees in 2009 to 95 employees in 2012 (with an additional 45 jobs planned for the middle of 2012). Jo&rsquo;Burger, in addition to its original gourmet burger restaurant in Rathmines, now also runs three other restaurants in Dublin&rsquo;s city centre.</p>\r\n<p>The new investor, John Roberts, inject capital and loans into Jo&rsquo;Burger, he also brought a number of key skills to the company which complement Joe Macken&rsquo;s creative skills. John Roberts recognised that Jo'Burger had a good market offering which could be scaled, and this has led to the development of other restaurants based on the successful Jo'Burger template of offering innovative food at good value prices.</p>\r\n<p>Jo&rsquo;Burger&rsquo;s employees say that John Roberts has brought an element of structure and stability to the company. The financial input that John Roberts made in Jo&rsquo;Burger was, however, the critical factor as a number of examinerships in relation to other companies had failed because they had not been able to secure additional investors.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Roberts makes the point that external parties considering an investment in a small company to enable it to restructure may face additional risks compared with investing in a larger company. Smaller companies may lack detailed financial data to allow potential external investors to make an in-depth analysis of their commercial viability and the potential returns from investing in a small company may not be enough to justify the cost of undertaking a due diligence investigation.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, their management structures and processes may be weak. Mr Roberts also makes the observation that the dynamics of family-run SMEs present their own particular challenges to external investors. He recognised early on in the examinership process that the Mackens were the heart and soul of Jo&rsquo;Burger and were vital to the business.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Roberts says that ultimately it was because Jo&rsquo;Burger had both a good product and had scalability potential that allowed it to successfully emerge from its restructuring. It was fortuitous that Joe Macken through his industry contacts was able to discover and learn more about examinership. At the time, examinership was a little known and even less understood legal process. The recession has raised the profile of examinership and the numbers of companies applying for the process have increased.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Macken was equally fortuitous that he made contact with Mr Hughes, an expert on examinership, as his initial contact with a different professional adviser had led him to believe that examinership was not an option for Jo&rsquo;Burger.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Tom Martin, Tom Martin &amp; Associates/TMA, Ireland.</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>John Roberts and Joe Macken, directors and shareholders in Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd</p>\r\n<p>Simone Cullen, an employee of Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd</p>\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Jo&rsquo;Burger Ltd</p>\r\n<p>137 Rathmines road</p>\r\n<p>Rathmines</p>\r\n<p>Dublin 6</p>\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3>\r\n<p>&lsquo;The Young Bloods: Joe Macken&rsquo;, <em>The Phoenix</em>, April 6, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Muscling in on the meat game,&rsquo; <em>Irish Times</em>, Saturday, February 4, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>The Examinership website (www.examinership.ie) published by Hughes Blake, Chartered Accountants, promotes awareness of the court-supervised corporate recovery examinership process.</p>"~"Ireland"~"56 - food and beverage service activities"~"10-49"~"50-249"~NULL~"(avoiding) bankruptcy*internal restructuring"~"2012-04-27"
"Linette, Estonia"~"Linette OÜ"~"<p>This Estonian lingerie company had to compete with producers from Asia, changing economic circumstances and disagreements between shareholders. This led to dividing up the company into three separate entities, losing some of the workforce and changing the management structure.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Linette O&Uuml; designs and makes high-quality women&rsquo;s lingerie. Its products are sold both directly and through retailers all over the world. In 2008&ndash;2009, Linette carried out an internal restructuring process that resulted in staff cutbacks, redistribution of tasks and outsourcing of many of the company&rsquo;s activities. This case study focuses on the internal restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>Linette was founded in December 1940 when some entrepreneurs pooled their finance and know-how and decided to establish a clothes production <em>&lsquo;artel&rsquo;</em> (cooperative association) called V&otilde;it (<em>&lsquo;</em> victory&rsquo;). Since 1956 the company has specialised in making women&rsquo;s lingerie.</p>\r\n<p>In 1991 V&otilde;it had a pioneering role as one of the first seven companies privatised in the Soviet Union. The company, now owned by its employees, was renamed Linette O&Uuml;. Shortly afterwards Estonia regained its independence and the business environment changed considerably. Linette&rsquo;s management was quick to take advantage of these new opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>In the same year, construction work started on a new building. Up to this time, Linette&rsquo;s production had been scattered in 14 different locations across Tallinn, but most of the facilities were old basements, unfit for purpose. In spring 1992 the first retail store was opened in Tallinn. Today Linette has seven stores across Estonia.</p>\r\n<p>In 1993, Linette started producing for the Swedish lingerie brand Miss Mary of Sweden. Soon most of the products carrying Miss Mary&rsquo;s trademark were made by Linette. The owner of this company also became a majority shareholder in Linette &ndash; Torpet F&ouml;rvaltnings AB bought 75% of the shares. The rest was owned by 64 small shareholders (mostly current and former employees, including the managing director at that time). In 2009 Torpet F&ouml;rvaltnings AB was bought out by the minority shareholders. Six of these seven shareholders are working at the firm.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, in 1994, Linette moved to a new 6,800 m&sup2; production facility where brand new equipment had also been installed.</p>\r\n<p>In 2001, Linette started producing for the United Kingdom&rsquo;s second largest retail store Asda (which belongs to the WalMart group) under the brand name George. This widening of activities resulted in a considerable increase in turnover and exports. The annual turnover was approximately &euro;4 million and during the best years the company made a profit of over &euro;200,000. About 70% of production went to export.</p>\r\n<p>Most of Linette&rsquo;s staff of 200 employees in 2008 had very long tenure. The majority had worked there between 10 and 40 years and many were close friends. For example, the now former Managing Director, Mai Parras, had been running the company successfully since the 1970s. There is a trade union in the company. It was formed a long time ago during Soviet times and has in many ways become a nominal body which has not been actively involved in company activities. The trade union was informed of the restructuring, but it did not take active role in the restructuring process.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Background to restructuring event</strong></p>\r\n<p>The economic environment started to negatively affect Linette in 2005. International textile and clothes quotas, established 31 years before, were removed and Chinese products flooded the European Union markets (with a five-fold increase in many categories). This was followed by the negative impact of a sharp rise in average salary level accompanying the economic boom in Estonia. Linette did not go along with the salary rally. As a result, many sewing operators (a relatively low paid profession) left the firm in search of better pay and an easier job.</p>\r\n<p>Initially, the warning signs were largely ignored. One reason was that income from real estate sales kept the cash flow positive and the company profitable in 2007. Otherwise, the loss that year would have been almost &euro;500,000.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, problems began with the Asda orders. Asda company policy did not allow its orders to exceed one-third of the supplier&rsquo;s total production. It wished to place larger orders with Linette, but this would have meant also increasing overall production. This was not an option for the company for a number of reasons, such as the fact that sewing operators were leaving. Soon afterwards Asda stopped ordering from Linette.</p>\r\n<p>Linette was also experiencing other problems. Some western European companies, knowing of Linette&rsquo;s rapid and high-quality production, ordered small test batches which Linette priced low on the basis of promises of larger follow-up orders. However, the latter were instead ordered from cheaper Chinese producers.</p>\r\n<p>So at a time when Estonia&rsquo;s economy was booming, orders were decreasing year by year and sewing operators were leaving. The number of employees decreased from 360 in 2005 to about 200 in 2007 (this includes closing down a branch in Viljandi where 13 sewing operators were employed). In a way, this voluntary downsizing made it easier to adapt to lower production levels. However, the size of administration and other support staff remained unchanged. In addition, the new building was now too large for this lower volume of orders.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Restructuring processes</strong></p>\r\n<p>In 2008, the company experienced negative cash flow each month. By the end of the summer the company started running out of money. Relations with the banks became tense as Linette had outstanding short-term loans due next year and also an overdraft. The looming global financial and economic crisis only compounded matters as the banks became even more conservative in their lending policy.</p>\r\n<p>In July 2008, the long-time manager, Ms Parras, stepped down as Managing Director and instead became Chair of the Board. Hendrik Tibar took over her role. He had joined the company in 2000 as a production manager. Ms Parras had been preparing him as her replacement for some years, keeping him informed of the company&rsquo;s business, as she had been thinking about stepping aside. He did not have prior experience of running a company and no familiarity with the restructuring process that was awaiting him. However, he had an MBA from Tallinn University of Technology.</p>\r\n<p>The first major task for Mr Tibar was to prepare a restructuring plan for the company and to present it to the board. Two issues were clear: the administrative staff was too large for the size of the company and the building was too large for its purpose. The first restructuring proposals were presented in the beginning of August 2008. However, at the board meeting it became clear that there was a clash of interests between the majority shareholder and minority shareholders. No agreement on the restructuring plan was reached. Mr Tibar was asked to prepare a new plan for the next board meeting. These took place monthly and for each one Mr Tibar prepared new restructuring scenarios. The negotiations continued for six months. During this time Mr Tibar prepared about 20 different restructuring plans (including many with detailed financial calculations).</p>\r\n<p>The cornerstone of these plans was that Linette had three primary business lines &ndash; production, sales and design under the Linette trademark &ndash; plus real estate. There were three to four possible answers to questions such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>whether Linette should shut down production in Estonia and start outsourcing from Latvia or China;</li>\r\n<li>whether Linette should be in the real estate business at all.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>One scenario was bankruptcy if no changes were made. The others were variations of the answers to the questions above with minor differences in financial figures.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, at the end of 2008 the majority shareholder pushed his wishes through and an agreement was reached. It had three parts.</p>\r\n<p>The first was that Linette would be split into three different companies according to activity:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>production of lingerie (Linette Production O&Uuml;);</li>\r\n<li>design and sales of Linette lingerie (O&Uuml; Linette Retail);</li>\r\n<li>real estate (Linette AS, which owned the former two companies);</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Second, transactions between these three companies would be made using cost-based prices (the market price for real estate) plus a small profit margin.</p>\r\n<p>Third, the company would be reorganised. Some people would be laid off, the functions of all departments and employees would change and some functions would be outsourced</p>\r\n<p>Although the agreement had been reached in December, the management did not want to start laying off people before Christmas. Mr Tibar waited until 3 January and then started announcing to employees that they were being laid off. To be considered a collective redundancy this had to be done at the same time. However, some employees claimed they were ill in order not to receive the redundancy notice. This increased the restructuring cost for Linette since public support could not be used for their severance payments.</p>\r\n<p>The employees had known for a long time that some changes had to be made in the company and were expecting them. However, the extent of the restructuring came as a surprise to them. Even so, they appreciated that the management worked by the rules, followed the law and paid the appropriate benefits. With cutbacks happening in many Estonian companies due to the economic crisis this was often not the case.</p>\r\n<p>Altogether 60 people out of 200 were laid off, but none of the sewing operators. Two people remained in Linette AS (Mr Tibar as manager and one handyman instead of nine previously). In Linette Retail 32 remained, including six sewing operators. The rest of staff (mainly sewing operators) were employed by Linette Production. The split up into three companies took place in March 2009.</p>\r\n<p>The employees were informed of the restructuring at the same time as the staff cutbacks. They had of course known that something was about to happen as Mr Tibar had had to consult them in developing the restructuring plans. The employees who did not lose their jobs were consulted after the restructuring announcement on how to divide the tasks between themselves. They had to do additional tasks and take on new responsibilities.</p>\r\n<p>There are some rules for picking people to be laid off in case of collective redundancy. According to the Employment Contract Act the representative of employees and full-time employees have the priority to remain employed. From the latter the workers with best performance should be given priority. In addition to following these rules in picking people to be laid off Mr Tibar tried to choose the pensioners or those soon to become pensioners.</p>\r\n<p>Most employees took the news reasonably well, although in a tight-knit community it was still a shock to many. Some were struck by the realisation that being one of the best in a field is no guarantee against redundancy. The first half of 2009 was a hard time for the staff as they had to see their friends and colleagues leave. For the ones who remained, no pay cuts were implemented as salaries were already not very high. However, everybody had to take on new responsibilities while working hours and salaries were left unchanged.</p>\r\n<p>The employees who were about to leave trained the ones who remained during the four months before their contract could be ended. If someone had successfully trained a replacement and had no more work responsibilities they were not obliged to come to work anymore. Some of the employees laid off in 2009 now work for the company part time or on project based contracts. In this way, management&rsquo;s effort to part in friendly terms has proven to be valuable later on.</p>\r\n<p>Finally in November 2009 the minority shareholders made the majority shareholder an offer to buy them (the minority) out. To their surprise, the majority shareholder responded with a proposal to sell out to the minority shareholders instead. The latter decided to take up the offer. Consequently, an unforeseen second phase of restructuring, followed.</p>\r\n<p>It was agreed that the majority shareholder would get full ownership of Linette Production O&Uuml; and the minority shareholders would get the two other companies. For that purpose a new holding company with seven owners with equal shares was formed. The seven owners were employees (including Mr Tibar and Ms Parras) and one new person. This way Mr Tibar also became an owner of the company. He financed his acquisition of shares by taking a bank loan. In addition, this new company made a compulsory takeover of the shares of roughly 60 small shareholders (most owning 1&ndash;2 shares, but some also with 50 shares, in total 6% of 5,600 shares).</p>\r\n<p>No new bank loans were used by Linette AS to finance these two phases of restructuring. Part of it was financed by Linette&rsquo;s savings. In the autumn they had tough negotiations with the Tax Board concerning the payment schedule for the outstanding tax arrears. The outstanding bank loans were refinanced when the minority shareholders reached a deal with the banks and signed a contract on 11 December 2009. According to this deal, the minority shareholders bought out the majority shareholder and paid the money directly to the bank to cover his other loan obligations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</strong></p>\r\n<p>It was hard to reach an agreement between the shareholders. The interests of the majority shareholder did not converge with others. He preferred Linette Production O&Uuml; to use lower transfer prices for production in transactions with O&Uuml; Linette Retail and Linette AS, to make outsourcing cheaper for the Miss Mary brand. With the payback date for the loan coming closer and closer, both the majority owner (joined by Mr Tibar) and minority shareholders (represented by Ms Parras) went to the banks for discussions about the restructuring plans. The banks were inclined towards the latter. However, the banks also saw that the company shareholders were not unified, which displeased them. Consequently, neither party made much progress with the banks.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, tax arrears (from severances) started to accumulate during the summer of 2009. By the end of the summer the firm had outstanding obligations of about &euro;400,000 to suppliers, &euro;250,000 in tax arrears and a &euro;640,000 overdraft.</p>\r\n<p>There was an unfortunate event as part of the staff cutbacks. One salesperson, a long-time employee at Linette, did not take the news of being laid off very well. During the first four months of restructuring he was still responsible for maintaining relationships with his clients. He was asked for an offer by an important buyer from Sweden, but he rudely refused to prepare one. Linette&rsquo;s management learned about it only after the man had already left and a new salesperson contacted this company. They were so offended by this behaviour that they never became a customer again.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Restructuring advice and support</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr Tibar considered also using an external adviser to guide the company through the restructuring process. He asked for offers from some consultants for both major restructuring phases (split-up and ownership change). However, the management considered these offers to be too expensive and decided to do it on their own.</p>\r\n<p>They did use lawyers to deal with the legal aspects of restructuring, but only the contracts for buying out the majority shareholder were fully prepared by the lawyers. All other restructuring matters were handled by the management itself as there is lots of relevant material available on the internet. They did, however, use about two hours of legal consultations to see if they were on the right tracks &ndash; doing things in the right order at the right time (especially for tax purposes and to minimise costs).</p>\r\n<p>Given the number of people made redundant, the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund (Eesti T&ouml;&ouml;tukassa) met half of the severance costs. At that time the labour laws were quite strict in Estonia. As most of the staff had long tenure they had to be given notice four months before their contract could be ended and then be paid severance equal to four months&rsquo; salary. This meant a total of eight months&rsquo; salary costs (including taxes) for the company &ndash; a considerable amount. Therefore, funding from the Unemployment Insurance Fund helped greatly in avoiding bankruptcy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Outcomes of restructuring</strong></p>\r\n<p>In general, the new owners and management consider the restructuring to be successful. The process itself went according to plan. The cost of restructuring was almost &euro;500,000. Thanks to the efforts of the new owners, the building is now fully rented out (Linette uses one-tenth itself, but together with the former Linette Production they use one-third), despite the fact that there are several half-empty office and production buildings in the neighbourhood.</p>\r\n<p>The company earned a profit in 2010 and in the following years (the turnover is now over &euro;1 million and profit over &euro;100,000). In 2012, its cash flow turned positive. Today, all support services (lawyers, cleaning, accounting, IT and so on) are outsourced and according to Mr Tibar&rsquo;s estimates this provides a considerable cost saving for the company. No major risks have been identified due to this outsourcing. There is also no longer a personnel specialist &ndash; these tasks are performed by others.</p>\r\n<p>The company can now focus more on producing profitable niche products and promoting Linette&rsquo;s trademark. However, the separation of production functions remains a risk for the company. The production of larger orders is outsourced from Miss Mary Productions O&Uuml; (the new name of Linette Production O&Uuml;). Essentially, these are the former colleagues of current staff still residing in the same building. However, the working relations with these people are now formal. This means, for example, that reacting quickly to Linette&rsquo;s orders (which is important to their customers) or allowing them to use some specific machines is currently often done out of goodwill from the former colleagues. Should the employees leave, these exceptions might no longer be possible.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mr Tibar pointed out that SMEs, especially the smaller ones, might be disadvantaged compared to the large companies in restructuring mainly due to financial issues. Linette was big enough so the banks did consider its case. For smaller firms it could be more difficult to convince banks of their profit potential. For example, it is harder for loan advisers to understand the specific business area if the company does not have close and frequent contact with the bank.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, SMEs have the advantage of reacting quickly to changing environments. Otherwise, the large and small companies face similar issues in restructuring. The key is to understand:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>what a company is good at;</li>\r\n<li>what a company can do by itself and what can be profitably outsourced.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In general, Mr Tibar is satisfied with the restructuring process and outcomes. He is very pleased that they chose a do-it-yourself approach and did not use too many lawyers and other expensive consultants. In his view, this saved Linette a lot of money and the process was carried out faster. Looking back, he mentions three things he would have done differently.</p>\r\n<p>First, once an agreement is reached on some aspects of restructuring that have to be made anyway (that is in this case staff cutbacks), the company should start implementing these right away. Linette waited until an agreement was reached in all aspects of the restructuring plan. Consequently, they lost six months and this cost them &euro;30,000-40,000 per month, almost bringing the company to bankruptcy. In the end, the implemented restructuring scheme was essentially the same as laid out in the very first proposal.</p>\r\n<p>Second, he should have listened less to shareholders&rsquo; quarrels and pushed more vigorously on starting the changes. He should have taken more risk himself as a leader-manager. One reason for the hesitation was that when he became the manager at the beginning of the restructuring process the former manager, Ms Parras (now Chair of the Board), was still present at the company every day for a few months. She was still his boss, and employees often went to her to complain, not to him.</p>\r\n<p>Third, they should have thought through better how to divide the assets between the new companies. This is important for two main reasons: it matters how the balance sheet looks to the banks, and in terms of tax issues it is better to have a clearer division.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Author </strong></p>\r\n<p>Kadri Kuusk, Praxis Center for Policy Studies</p>\r\n<p><strong>Information sources</strong></p>\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Hendrik Tibar, Owner and Manager and Signe Liloson, Purchasing and Sales Manager</p>\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Linette O&Uuml;</p>\r\n<p>Mahtra 30A</p>\r\n<p>Tallinn 13811</p>\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.linette.ee/"">www.linette.ee</a></p>\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=""http://leht.aripaev.ee/?PublicationId=464dc490-fb94-4024-9b75-258ddc8543a9&amp;articleid=99241&amp;paperid=F5C9D5A9-80F1-41AC-B761-EA39BB69A7E6"">Eesti ihupesu</a> <a href=""http://leht.aripaev.ee/?PublicationId=464dc490-fb94-4024-9b75-258ddc8543a9&amp;articleid=99241&amp;paperid=F5C9D5A9-80F1-41AC-B761-EA39BB69A7E6"">r&auml;ndab Euroopa naiste garderoobi</a>. <em>&Auml;rip&auml;ev</em>, 13.02.2004 (accessed 20.02.2012)</p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://leht.aripaev.ee/?PublicationId=464dc490-fb94-4024-9b75-258ddc8543a9&amp;articleid=83050&amp;paperid=F171709D-FA16-445C-BF2E-90A2AE85D44"">Eesti &otilde;mblusfirma sai suurtellimuse</a>.<em> &Auml;rip&auml;ev</em>, 05.12.2001 (accessed 20.02.2012)</p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.ap3.ee/?PublicationId=31503ED6-39D4-4163-9D98-74AA1E3959CE&amp;code=2857/uud_uudidx_285707"">EL tahab Hiina tekstiili sissevoolu piirata</a>. <em>&Auml;rip&auml;ev,</em> 26.04.2005 (accessed 20.02.2012)</p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/586319"">Terasniidist s&uuml;ndinud pesu</a>. <em>Eesti P&auml;evaleht</em>, 30.10.2010 (accessed 20.02.2012)</p>"~"Estonia"~"14 - manufacture of wearing apparel"~"50-249"~"10-49"~"globalisation"~"internal restructuring"~"2012-02-17"
"Manufacturing company, the Netherlands"~"Manufacturing company"~"<p>A one-person company has slowly expanded since the 1980s and now has offices in Belgium and Spain. The expansion to Spain was the result of a business opportunity spotted by the owner based on personal experience and finding a local business partner and not previously planned.</p>"~"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The company in this case study was established late in the 1980s, and is a manufacturing company. It has a production line in the Netherlands and in Spain, and also a sales office in Belgium. The company sells its products throughout Europe. The main export countries are Spain, Belgium, Germany, France and Austria.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the turnover of the company (about 70%) is generated in the Netherlands. Next to that, Spain and Belgium are the two biggest countries regarding the generated turnover.</p>\r\n<p>For this case study an interview was held with the sole owner of the company, who also founded the company in the late 1980s. The company started as a one-person business, but the first three employees were hired in the first year of the company&rsquo;s existence. Mid 2012, the office in the Netherlands employs around 65 employees. The production line in Spain employs eight people, and the sales office in Belgium has one employee (a sales manager).</p>\r\n<p>The organisation structure of the company in the Netherlands is relative compact, with three people in the management team (next to the owner). The company does not have a works council. The owner has asked, in the past, the employees if they wanted to form a works council, but they did not feel the need to organise themselves via a works council. The work culture in the company is very positive and productive, and the employees did not see/feel the need to organise themselves in a works council.</p>\r\n<p>The sales office in Belgium falls under the management responsibility of the commercial manager in the Netherlands. The production line in Spain has its own management responsibility, but does fall directly under the owner of the company (in the Netherlands).</p>\r\n<p>The company has had, since the start-up, a relatively stable growth in its number of employees. Even the crisis of recent years did not have a large impact on the company. The product in itself is relatively crisis proof: the demand is relatively stable in most economic times. The only effect of the crisis at the moment is that the turnover is not increasing, this mainly because of the heavier competition in regards to the margins of the products.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event(s)</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The company has opened two offices abroad since the start of the production line in the Netherlands (late 1980s). This encompasses a sales office in Belgium, and a sales office in Spain which eventually resulted in a production line in Spain.</p>\r\n<p>The sales office in Belgium was formed at the end of the 1990&rsquo;s. In 2012, one person is employed at this office. The main reason for having this sales office was for the company to be able to (better) serve the Belgian market. The owner noticed that Belgian customers find it more agreeably to have a local partner with whom they can do business, established in Belgium and with a Belgian address. With this local sales office the company is better suited to supply the Belgian market. The orders that are placed via this sales office are sent to the production line in the Netherlands.</p>\r\n<p>The company has a production facility in Spain, which opened its doors in 2007. Before this, the company just had a sales office in Spain (comparable to the one in Belgium). The sales office in Spain started early in the 2000&rsquo;s, and employed one person. When the sales office was running for about five years, the owner of the company (in the Netherlands) bought a piece of land in Spain on which he had a production facility build. The sales office was consolidated with this production facility.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The main focus of this case is the opening of the production facility in Spain. But before this, the owner has had some experience in setting up sales offices in other EU countries. First of all, the owner recruited a person for a sales office in Belgium at the end of the 1990&rsquo;s. Although the office operates very independently, the main (management) responsibility lies with the commercial manager in the Netherlands. The recruited person got a (internal) training at the production facility in the Netherlands. The aim of this was to better familiarise the person with the business and production process.</p>\r\n<p>The sales office was opened with the funds that the company had available. There was enough reserve in the company to facilitate and finance the opening of a sales office in Belgium. No additional funding was needed.</p>\r\n<p>Before the beginning of this century the company was doing a lot of business with one customer in Spain. Early in the 2000&rsquo;s an employee at this customer wanted to set up a sales office for the manufacturing company in Spain. The owner of the manufacturing company had a very good working relation with this person and they both saw the potential of having a sales office in Spain, specifically aimed at the Spanish market. This was generally for the same reasons for why the sales office was opened in Belgium. Being able to serve the local market with a local sales office made it easier to generate turnover in this country. The setup here was the same as with the sales office in Belgium: the sales office runs very independently, the main (management) responsibility lies with the commercial manager in the Netherlands.</p>\r\n<p>During 2005 the owner got the possibility to buy a piece of land in Spain, on which he built several warehouses. He talked about this with the office manager of the sales office in Spain, and they both concluded that there was a business opportunity here. They both came to the conclusion that buying the land, building several warehouses and selling them all but one (keeping this one for their own production facility) would be a very good investment. The other three managers of the manufacturing company in t</p>\r\n<p>he Netherlands were also consulted by the owner, and they agreed with the investment. The company has had some profitable years, so no additional funds were necessary for this investment.</p>\r\n<p>The person that was running the sales office was eventually made responsible for the production facility, and thus became the CEO of the production facility in Spain. The production site in Spain is a very independent company with its own management, and falls directly under the owner of the company (in the Netherlands). At the moment there are eight people working at the production facility in Spain. This growth was very gradual, and there were no big difficulties in finding these employees. The labour market for employees for the production line was very positive for the employer.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, the process of opening the production facility in Spain went very well. It took a lot of time of the owner in overseeing and helping in the process, but having the manager of the sales office in Spain helping in the process had a positive effect on the process. There were some minor delays in the building of the production line in Spain, but this was not a big problem.</p>\r\n<p>The opening of the production line in Spain was not planned at forehand, but was an opportunity the owner saw. He got, via his network, the opportunity to buy a piece of land in Spain. This land did not have anything on it, and he saw the opportunity that this granted. He discussed the investment with the other three managers, and they agreed with the investment. Also, the employees were very positive about the growth of the company. He bought the land. The process after the sale went very fast, within about a year and a half the warehouses were completed (the warehouses were relatively simple), and most of them were sold very quickly. The building of the warehouses was contracted to a local contractor, and for the sale of the warehouses a local real estate agent was hired. The overall process was supervised by the owner of the manufacturing company and the manager of sales office in Spain.</p>\r\n<p>The employees in the Netherlands were informed after the management of the company agreed with the investment in Spain. The employees of the office and production facility in the Netherlands were very willing in, for example, helping with the training of the office managers in Belgium and Spain. The management/owner also asked if someone wanted to go to Spain in helping setting up the production line over there. One employee volunteered for this (for which he got an extra financial compensation).</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>An important aspect of opening an office abroad is local knowledge. This was not that big of a problem with the opening of a sales office in Belgium, because the legislation here is not very dissimilar with the Netherlands, and language is also less of an issue.</p>\r\n<p>But especially with the building of a small industrial location, it is important that you work with someone who knows about the work mentality in Spain, and who can oversee the building process. This is why the owner choose to work with a local contractor and real estate agent, also with the aid of the manager of the sales office in Spain.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, when it was time to set up the production line itself an employee from the production line in the Netherlands moved (temporarily) to Spain to help with the setup. He had a lot of experience in working in the sector and at the company, and could thus help with organising and implementing a good and efficient production process. Also, one of the first machines that was placed in the production line in Spain was a (older) machine of the production line in the Netherlands. The employee from The Netherlands could therefore also help at the production line in Spain in setting up the machine and show them the intricacies of how the machine works.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>A lot of the support in the expansion process was given by the employees of the company in the Netherlands. They helped the sales office managers in teaching them the intricacies of the production process and the lessons learned in the Netherlands over the years. The employees were very willing in helping with the launch of the sales offices in Belgium and Spain, and later with the opening of the production line in Spain.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, most of the (informal) support came via the help of local business partners, who were able to help in finding and hiring a reliable building contractor and real estate agent. These were people who know the country, and therefore know the most important things to pay attention to. The owner also played a very big role in helping and mentoring the manager of the sales office in Spain (who eventually became the CEO of the production facility in Spain). He has a very hands on approach to this, and therefore spent a lot of time in Spain in helping with the realisation of his plans and ambitions. He was able to do this, because the production line in the Netherlands was running smoothly. The owner could take a step back in managing this company so that he could focus a lot of his energy on the expansion in Spain. The three managers were willing and able to keep the company running successfully without the direct presence of the owner.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The most practical outcome of the restructuring was the opening of two sales offices in Belgium and Spain. The good contacts and eager sales officer in Spain led eventually to the opening of a production line in Spain.</p>\r\n<p>Having a sales office in these countries helps in generating (additional) turnover. Local businesses feel more comfortable in doing business with a company in their own country than from abroad. This creates more trust, and made it easier to (actively) approach potential customers.</p>\r\n<p>In busier times there were two people employed in Belgium, so this fluctuates a little bit. This was also the case for the sales office in Spain. But when the production line opened, the company in Spain grew steadily since mid 2000s from one employee to the current eight employees.</p>\r\n<p>The main consequence for the employees in the Netherlands was that some (experienced) employees were asked to help in training and advising the (soon to be) CEO of the production facility in Spain. This was done on a voluntary basis. The employee from the Netherlands who went to Spain (for about a month) did get an extra financial compensation for his work abroad.</p>\r\n<p>At the moment, all the businesses (in the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain) have very stable turnover figures. The turnover was increasing, before the crisis, but the current stable position seems to be maintained. There are no plans for growing any further the coming period.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The owner does not have any plans to expand at the moment. The size of the company is about the size he wants. Perhaps a little growth might be possible, but it does not have any priority. The owner has a good overview of the company at the moment, and becoming any bigger will give additional controlling issues. Some growth might be desirable in Spain, but this is not the main focus at the moment.</p>\r\n<p>The owner is very happy about the growth of the company by expanding across the borders. It took a lot of time and energy but the results are good. Looking back there are not many things he would do differently. The only thing he overlooked during the process was the possibility to get a subsidy (in Belgium) for starting up a company and keeping people employed in Belgium.</p>\r\n<p>The owner also mentions that within the EU there are little differences between the countries. Everything has (at the basis) the same look and feel to it, and that makes it a lot easier to open offices in other EU countries. This is why the owner saw (and felt) no big obstacles in investing in a production facility in Spain. However, he did feel the need to get specific expertise and manpower on certain subjects (like the building contractor and real estate agent).</p>\r\n<p>The most key element of successfully opening an office in another country is in working with people form the country. The main function of the office and employees in the Netherlands was to train and educate the local contacts who were going to be responsible for the office in that country. This worked very well, and the employees were very willing to help.</p>\r\n<p>The owner has had a very hands-on approach regarding the expansion process. He has spent a lot of time helping and stimulating the local employees in getting the work done. This means that he has spent a lot of time abroad, which was not a problem for the owner. He had the ambition to expand and was very motivated in achieving his ambition.</p>\r\n<p>The owner does not feel that additional (professional) guidance would have helped him in the expansion process. He has a very good network of contacts in the different countries from doing business with them, and can thus use the expertise of these local contacts.</p>\r\n<p>When looking at the differences between small, large and medium company, in expanding abroad the interviewed owner sees one big difference. He feels that larger companies are more likely to buy / take-over a company in the country. Smaller companies are more likely to, like in this case, build up an office in another country, whereas a large company has more financial means to buy a company that already exists on their market in that country.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Michel Winnubst, EIM</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>Interview with the owner and information from the website of the company</p>"~"Netherlands"~"22 - manufacture of rubber and plastic products"~"50-249"~"50-249"~"globalisation"~"business expansion"~"2012-09-12"
"Meble Bugajski, Poland"~"Meble Bugajski"~"<p>This Polish furniture producer has managed to succeed in the market by adapting flexibly to changing customer markets and tastes. By introducing new production methods and insourcing more and by strengthening domestic sales, variations in international sales were more easily absorbed. However, 30 employees lost their jobs.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>The Meble Bugajski company was established by Slawomir Bugajski in November 1991 in Wieloglowy near Nowy Sacz, in the Malopolska Region. At the beginning of its operations, the company’s owner and its only employee was involved in multi-sectoral trade, including an international dimension. As a former sportsman, a cyclist, he had many contacts, both in Poland and abroad, which he used in his business. From the start of operations, the legal status of the company has remained unchanged and it continues to operate as a sole proprietorship.   </p>\r\n<p>The owner holds secondary level education (vocational secondary school with <i>matura</i>, the equivalent of the GCSE). He did not receive any technical or economics education nor did he have any previous work experience; however, he has taken part in professional development training courses. </p>\r\n<p>In February 1994, Slawomir Bugajski decided to change the profile of his company from trade into trade and production. He had neither the experience nor the know-how concerning the furniture market and production but had noticed a significant demand for these types of products. Thus he became involved in the production of furniture. Initially he made furniture by himself in a basement of his parents’ house, his only fixed assets being a truck and basic tools to make furniture. At the time, he still did not employ any members of staff, and he only used services of an accountant, who was his friend and helped him to manage accounts. He dealt with supplies, production, distribution and sale of his products by himself, and delivered within a range of 200 km from the seat of his company. Direct contacts with buyers allowed him to match the production offer to the needs of his customers.</p>\r\n<p>All the furniture products are made from high-quality components, which guarantee a professional look and high-quality usability for many years. Moreover, well-qualified staff, knowledge and long-term experience allows for constant development of products, to fit the needs of customers perfectly.The Meble Bugajski company produces all types of upholstered furniture, in the belief that it is able to offer customers a diverse range of comfortable suites, including armchairs, two to three person sofas, and corners. It offer wide selection of fabrics, leathers or alcantaras, in a wide range of colours, imported or ordered from best Polish companies. In addition, it offers a wide range of additional options to choose from, which allows for customised furniture.</p>\r\n<p>At present (2012), the company employs 90 employees and this represents a decline in relation to 2006, when it employed almost 120 employees. The number of staff in the individual years has ranged as follows: 2006: 120 employees; 2007: 98; 2008: 91; 2009: 94; 2010: 95; 2011: 93; and 2012: 90. Out of the current employees, 65% are male while 35% are female. The age structure is as follows: 5% of females aged between 22 and 30 years, the rest above 30 years; 10% of males aged between 22 and 30 years, the rest above 30 years. The education structure is as follows: 5% higher, 20% secondary, 75%  vocational.</p>\r\n<p>There are no trade union representatives in the company. There are no representatives of such bodies as council of employees or other formal structures of staff representatives. The owner does not have any formalised business development plans. </p>\r\n<p>The structure of gross sale has ranged as follows: 2006 – € 2,232,500; 2007 – € 2,222,500; 2008 – € 2,110,000; 2009 – € 2,145,000; 2010 – € 2,246,250; 2011 – € 1,930,000.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>This company continues to operate in the same single location, and no branches have been established. Since 1994, the general profile of the company operations has not changed; however, the buyers’ markets are different. In 1995, the owner noticed increased demand for furniture, both on the domestic market and the emerging Eastern buyers’ market. By 1997, practically 85% of the products were exported to the former Soviet Union states (Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Lithuania). However since January 1998, due to the crisis in Russia, the Eastern market simply disappeared for Polish furniture manufacturers. They could not sell any furniture suites, stopped receiving orders from sales agents and wholesalers. The company faced a risk of losing financial liquidity. During the first six months of 1998, it had financial problems resulting from the lack of demand, both abroad and in Poland. Problems with selling the already made products on the local market were due to the colours of the furniture made for the Eastern customers. Fortunately its quality and prices were acceptable on the local market, which allowed to sell the finished stock without incurring major financial losses. That helped to avoid staff dismissals, although there was a surplus of labour force and production had to be suspended temporarily. </p>\r\n<p>As a result, the entrepreneur decided to search for new buyers abroad. That involved foreign business trips to attend furniture trade fairs in Zagreb, Ljubljana and Stockholm in order to learn about preferences and tastes of foreign customers. The company did not exhibit its products on these fairs, its owner only spoke with the exhibitors about issues such as colours, models, quality and prices at which he could sell his products abroad. He tried to initiate commercial cooperation with the exhibiting local companies. In order to search for contacts, he also used his acquaintances dating back to the times when he was a cyclist. His foreign colleagues from bicycle races facilitated his contacts with entrepreneurs they knew, and this type of personal recommendation was exceptionally useful for the small Polish business that did not have reputation and credibility among foreign businesses. </p>\r\n<p>Searching for new markets and adapting the product offer to their needs took over six months. During that time, Mr Bugajski also started to cooperate with foreign buyers, including a Swedish national, owner of a business manufacturing and selling furniture on the local Swedish market. On his way back from a fair in Milan, he passed Wieloglowy and became interested in Mr Bugajski’s company. Following a discussion, the two entrepreneurs decided to start to cooperate in the field of furniture making by the company in Wieloglowy for the Swedish Partner. Sweden was not the only market with which the Polish entrepreneur started to cooperate. Initially he managed to initiate commercial contacts with enterprises from the Balkans (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Monte Negro), and then also from Slovakia and the Czech Republic. By 2004, the company’s structure of sales was shaping in the following way: 90% of the production constituted export (Sweden, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Monte Negro, Slovakia and the Czech Republic) which generated 80% of the revenues, while the remaining 10% was sold on the local market, which generated 20% of the revenues. The difference in the revenue proportions in relation to the volume of production sold in Poland and abroad resulted from the differences and fluctuations of the currency exchange rates impacting foreign transactions. </p>\r\n<p>Since 2005, the company changed its structure in terms of the target markets. Export activities were reduced to increase sale on the domestic and local market. In 2006, at the beginning of the restructuring process, almost 45% of the production was exported to the Scandinavian market, Germany, Switzerland and Croatia. The remaining 20% was sold on the local market and 35% on the national one. During that time, sale of furniture was growing slowly, while the profit margin remained stable. Currently 60% is represented by export and 40% by the domestic sale.</p>\r\n<p>The decision to restructure addressed the need to reduce the costs of production and improve the quality of the goods in accordance with long-term plans targeting production of more exclusive products. It also resulted from an unexpected loss of a key importer – a client from Switzerland, which took place in 2006. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The first restructuring measures were implemented in 2006 and continued until 2008. The key actions involved employment restructuring (review, appraisal of skills and staff dismissals) and extending production to manufacture furniture of a higher quality and basing it partly on insourcing of making furniture components (benches, woodworking joints) which before had been made by subcontractors.</p>\r\n<p>The production process was also changed by replacing the two-shift system with one-shift; also, organisation of deliveries to the recipients was changed (reorganisation of storage of the finished furniture in a warehouse and the delivery system (<i>just in time</i>) to eliminate the costly process of storage and keeping finished furniture in the warehouse. The company made furniture following receipt of an order, and then, almost immediately, it was loaded to trucks that delivered it to its recipients. As a result of introducing such a system, the company’s own transport and delivery system was established, which enabled to maintain flexibility and independence of external carriers. </p>\r\n<p>The company developed and started to promote its own brand name, ‘MB Design’, trying to introduce it to the existing sales network in order to emphasise the more exclusive nature of its products. That decision resulted from a risk of perceiving the company as a ‘no name’ manufacturer, which would imply dependence on the current sale channels and network of stores. The new brand name was promoted in Poland and the Czech Republic in particular.</p>\r\n<p>The decision on the need for restructuring was made by the owner who also based it on opinions of the following six managerial staff members: director of production, manager of production and foremen. Those decisions however were not formally recorded, there was no schedule for them (although some general assumptions concerning time of their implementation were adopted, which were then modified under the process of introducing changes). Employees and their representatives (none) were not included in the process of restructuring planning and implementation. Other restructuring-based measures were not taken into account either. Any changes and financial investments were delivered exclusively with funds provided by the owner, and in case of purchase of vehicles for the transport and delivery department, leasing was applied.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The company’s employees were informed about the measures implemented by their immediate superiors at the beginning of the restructuring process. Further information was disseminated on an on-going basis. The response of employees was generally negative and distrustful as the process involved dismissing 30 employees. </p>\r\n<p>There were difficulties in overcoming stereotypes related to work and production organisation as well as schedules and routine in the company, and overcoming the mental resistance of the staff.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The owner is of the opinion that professional assistance at the stage of preparing and planning restructuring of the company would have provided significant support for the planning and implementation process; however, he did not receive any assistance. He did not have information on the means of obtaining such support from government institutions. Due to financial reasons, the company could not afford to obtain any support from commercial entities because they are too expensive.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcome of the restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Restructuring followed in accordance with the assumptions adopted, and its outcomes met the expectations planned. The company improved its situation and has maintained its <i>status quo</i> in its sector. It introduced its new own product, the ‘MB Design’ brand name in the form of leather-made furniture. </p>\r\n<p>In the course of the restructuring process, around 30 employees with the lowest qualifications and competences were dismissed. These were blue-collar workers employed at the furniture production department, who had basic vocational education and carried out the simplest physical activities involving packing and moving finished furniture to its storing space in the warehouse, and loading it into trucks. They were selected for dismissal by their immediate superiors and the dismissals had to be approved by the company owner himself. The staff reduction process was implemented successively and in stages in order to avoid the so called collective redundancies. Changing the two-shift system into a one-shift system and limiting overtime arising from the need to cut costs were accomplished by vacating a rented building in which one of the production process stages had been carried out. </p>\r\n<p>After a ten-month period, the best 25 employees of the company received a pay rise.</p>\r\n<p>The individual department managers changed work organisation by redefining and elaborating the scope of competence and responsibilities of employees of the departments of production, transport and deliveries. A one-shift system was introduced in the production department, which reduced the production volume, while the company’s turnover remained at the same level as the company started to make MB Design furniture, which extended the company’s product line. At that time, 20% decline in the furniture sale was recorded while an 80% increase was recorded for MB Design. The structure of sale was as follows: 60% export, 40% domestic market.</p>\r\n<p>The company decided to support the employees continuing their work for the company and delegated to other departments through internal training and practical courses providing skills to work at new posts. Staff requalification efforts were also supported.  </p>\r\n<p>The response of the employees to the changes introduced was rather sceptical, suspicious and distrustful in general, on account of the staff dismissals. However, the company survived in the market and extended the scope of its operations by 30%. The fact that the staff working prior to the restructuring could stay and their salaries were raised is also of importance. </p>\r\n<p>In his current plans, the owner envisages business development through construction of a new production facility, increased production capacity, further consistent promotion of the company’s own brand name, MB Design, establishing its own sale channels and networks in Poland, and entry to new store networks in the EU. Plans concerning the employees include vocational training and assistance to upgrade their qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>According to the owner, restructuring processes in large and small enterprises differ. Large enterprises have the funds to use professional support in the course of restructuring. They also generate a stronger impact on government institutions to obtain their support. On the other hand, medium-sized enterprises are more creative and faster in restructuring implementation. They demonstrate better flexibility during the process. SMEs hold significantly smaller human resources necessary for planning restructuring. They also lack funding necessary in the course of implementation of restructuring changes. The lack of trade unions is favourable, as they delay the dynamics of restructuring. They lack formalised procedures, which make changes more difficult. </p>\r\n<p>The experience acquired by the owner during the restructuring process helped him to use a different approach to these measures now. Firstly, he is of the opinion that he would take more care in the process of staff dismissals. He would treat the opinions of immediate superiors with lower priority, as they often follow their personal feelings (likes and dislikes).</p>\r\n<p>As regards <i>public support,</i> the owner thinks that it should be more flexible in terms of changing fixed costs to help businesses with their tax obligations, for example by using temporary tax suspension or postponement for companies undergoing difficult process of restructuring.</p>\r\n<p>He is also of the opinion that he should spend more time in preparing and planning the restructuring. It is worth trying to consult other entrepreneurs and verify outcomes, results and introduce corrections on the on-going basis in the course of the implementation stage.</p>\r\n<p>The opinions of the owner were matched by those of the company production manager (47 years of age, 15 years of service, in large furniture-making facilities in particular). He was personally engaged in the company’s process of restructuring planning and implementation. In terms of his position, he was a superior of the staff covered by the restructuring measures (dismissals). He also proposed and justified dismissals of selected employees. </p>\r\n<p>He is of the opinion that the changes facilitated management of the other staff and introduced order in the scope of competence and responsibilities of the specific job positions. They also generated significant financial savings for the company, as the new work organisation increased efficiency. </p>\r\n<p>Employees of the company were informed of the restructuring planned; however, they were not involved in the decision on its implementation. Assistance offered to the employees by the company was limited to training to requalify the staff staying in the company. </p>\r\n<p>Employees’ reactions to restructuring were distrustful and negative. They expressed their anxiety and upset, and did not get involved. To the employees staying at the company restructuring meant stability and keeping work, as well as maintaining their current salary level, and perspective of pay rise. </p>\r\n<p>He does not think that the changes could be planned and implemented better. He said that, according to the persons involved in the restructuring process, the changes were optimum, as they generated the outcomes planned. When comparing restructuring in SMEs and large enterprises, he said that small enterprises lack experience and knowledge about restructuring. They also do not have funds. However, they can implement changes more dynamically and respond to changes in the environment faster due to their flexibility and the lack of bureaucracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gancarczyk, Jagiellonian University, Krakow</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><EMPH REND=""BOLD-ITALIC"">Interviews</EMPH></h3>\r\n<p>Slawomir Bugajski, owner and Grzegorz Młynarczyk, Production Manager</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><EMPH REND=""BOLD-ITALIC"">Company address</EMPH></h3>\r\n<p>Meble Bugajski </p>\r\n<p>Nowy Sacz</p>\r\n<p>164b Tarnowska St. </p>\r\n<p>Poland</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><EMPH REND=""BOLD-ITALIC"">Company website</EMPH></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a HREF=""http://www.meblebugajski.pl"">www.meblebugajski.pl</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Poland"~"31 - manufacture of furniture"~"50-249"~"50-249"~NULL~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2012-04-23"
"Mermaid, Denmark"~"Mermaid A/S"~"<p>A digital signage company in Denmark has expanded significantly over the last years by continously adding other companies with complementary products and markets across Scandinavia. After several waves of expansion, the next steps are about consolidation and rethinking the group structure.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Mermaid A/S is a total solution provider in digital signage with expertise in the development, production, and design of monitors and software. When the company started its activities in 2004, it was mainly a hardware company selling monitors and screens for digital signage, but through acquisitions and product development the company can now offer complete solutions in the following areas:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Monitors;</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Software platforms;</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Services (recurring business);</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Service-level agreements;</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Software upgrades;</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Administration contracts (customers outsourcing management of the platform);</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Content production.</p>\r\n<p>Mermaid&rsquo;s customers are companies with a need for dynamic signage: retailers, public transport and the public sector in general are the main customer segments.</p>\r\n<p>The development and acquisition of new products and services is part of a strategy where recurring business on the installed bases should generate an increasing share of revenue instead of through highly fluctuating hardware sales. Mermaid A/S expects to reach a milestone in 2012 where profit from recurring revenue will cover the fixed costs.</p>\r\n<p>Mermaid A/S was born out of a restructuring in 2004, when the fast growing PC manufacturer Mermaid Technology A/S, originally founded in 1997, more or less collapsed after changes in tax laws and competitive environment. The company closed and assets transferred to the new company Mermaid A/S.</p>\r\n<p>The re-born Mermaid sets out to be the leader in consolidation of the DDS market (Dynamic Digital Signage) in northern Europe &ndash; or even all of Europe - and Mermaid A/S now owns the companies mentioned in Table 1.</p>\r\n<p>Mermaid A/S is based in Glostrup, Copenhagen, and now has subsidiaries in Aarhus, Denmark and in Stockholm, Sweden and Oslo, Norway.</p>\r\n<table summary="""" border=""1""><caption>Table 1: Mermaid A/S&rsquo; acquisitions and current ownership</caption><colgroup> <col width=""38.20%"" /> <col width=""18.50%"" /> <col width=""23.00%"" /> <col width=""19.40%"" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr><th class=""TableHeadRow"">Company</th><th class=""TableHeadRow"">Acquired</th><th class=""TableHeadRow"">Location</th><th class=""TableHeadRow"">Ownership</th></tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Victor Soft</td>\r\n<td>2006</td>\r\n<td>&Aring;rhus, Denmark</td>\r\n<td>Merged with Mermaid A/S</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Acrossmedia A/S</td>\r\n<td>2007</td>\r\n<td>&Aring;rhus, Denmark</td>\r\n<td>100%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Mermaid Leasing ApS</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>Glostrup, Denmark</td>\r\n<td>100%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Mermaid Technology AS</td>\r\n<td>2008</td>\r\n<td>Oslo, Norway</td>\r\n<td>100%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Mermaid Technology AB</td>\r\n<td>2009</td>\r\n<td>Stockholm, Sweden</td>\r\n<td>100%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Mermaid Norway AS</td>\r\n<td>2011</td>\r\n<td>Oslo, Norway</td>\r\n<td>100%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><em>Source: Mermaid A/S prospect for First North 2009 and annual reports available at <a href=""http://www.mermaid.dk"">www.mermaid.dk</a>. </em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Today, the CEO and founder Henrik Johnsen holds 22.3% of the shares in Mermaid A/S. Other important shareholders are the chairman of the board (22.3 %), the former owners of Norden Media Solutions &ndash; now Mermaid Technology AB &ndash; (17 %) and COO at Mermaid, Mads Henrik Hansen (2.42 %.). The remaining 35% of the shares are held by minor shareholders.</p>\r\n<p>Daily operations are managed by CEO Henrik Johnsen and COO Mads Henrik Hansen. The COO was originally the founder of the first acquisition Victor Soft. CEO Henrik Johnsen has an education in IT (EDB assistant, Datanom) from 1983 and a management career in different companies in the IT and electronics industry until he co-founded Mermaid Technology in 1997. COO Mads Henrik Hansen also has an education in IT (Datamatiker) and a Master in Management of Technology. He gained his former management experience from founding Victor Soft A/S at the age of 22.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of 2011, the Mermaid group had about 60 employees &ndash; the large majority in Aarhus and Glostrup (Copenhagen), Denmark &ndash; and an outsourced team of 12 freelance software developers in Pakistan. Employees are mainly men between 25 and 45 years old and mainly technical staff including 12&ndash;15 hardware or software engineers. Administrative staff includes sales people and a few business graduates. Staff are generally organised in trade unions.</p>\r\n<p>The company is international in the sense that it has operations in three countries and is looking for potential acquisitions in other European countries like Finland and Germany. Export sales outside Denmark, Norway and Sweden are about 15%.</p>\r\n<p>Mermaid A/S has had a fluctuating turnover due to the original hardware based business model (Table 2). However, the increased focus on recurring business is expected to stabilise turnover and especially improve earnings. An almost constant increase in gross margin ratio suggests that they have succeeded.</p>\r\n<table summary="""" border=""1""><caption>Table 2: Turnover, gross profit and EBITDA in Mermaid A/S, 2005-2011</caption><colgroup> <col width=""18.70%"" /> <col width=""11.50%"" /> <col width=""11.50%"" /> <col width=""11.50%"" /> <col width=""11.50%"" /> <col width=""11.50%"" /> <col width=""11.50%"" /> <col width=""11.50%"" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1.000 DKK*</td>\r\n<td><strong>2005</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>2006</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>2007</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>2008</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>2009</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>2010</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>2011</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Net turnover</td>\r\n<td>16.752</td>\r\n<td>39.191</td>\r\n<td>31.733</td>\r\n<td>61.710</td>\r\n<td>55.575</td>\r\n<td>83.877</td>\r\n<td>71.417</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Gross profit</td>\r\n<td>4.725</td>\r\n<td>12.196</td>\r\n<td>11.290</td>\r\n<td>26.799</td>\r\n<td>31.724</td>\r\n<td>47.582</td>\r\n<td>45.464</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>EBITDA</td>\r\n<td>1.187</td>\r\n<td>3.273</td>\r\n<td>159</td>\r\n<td>850</td>\r\n<td>320</td>\r\n<td>12.739</td>\r\n<td>7.145</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><em>*) 1 DKK = &euro; 0.13 </em></p>\r\n<p><em>Source: Mermaid A/S, Annual reports. </em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Mermaid A/S&rsquo; activities are funded by 70% equity capital and 30% short term debt, and with external equity funding from First North they publish elaborate information for investors on their website at <a href=""http://mermaid.dk/investors"">http://mermaid.dk/investors</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring events</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring event described in this case study is a series of acquisitions made by Mermaid A/S from 2007 to 2011 with the first acquisition of Acrossmedia in 2007 described in most details. The reason for describing a series of acquisitions instead of just one event is that the whole acquisition process has been the key to building a complete product, service and technology platform that can make Mermaid A/S the European market leader. So it is actually a story about building a market leader in a new industry.</p>\r\n<p>To understand Mermaid today, it is important to know a bit about the original Mermaid Technology that was founded in 1997 with the current CEO Henrik Johnsen as cofounder. Mermaid Technology made customised computers with logistics as the core of their business model, since the founders had a background in logistics.</p>\r\n<p>According to Henrik Johnsen, the company became the fastest growing company in Denmark in 1998 and had grown to a turnover of DKK200&ndash;250 million (&euro;27-34 mill.) and 150 employees in 1999. However, a change in tax laws for home PCs for employees and the invasion of Dell computers on the market put a sudden stop to the success. After fighting hard for a few years out of moral obligation to the remaining employees and banks, the founders gave up Mermaid Technology and in 2004 Mr Johnsen founded Mermaid A/S with seven years of experience in managing rapid growth as well as rapid decline.</p>\r\n<p>The new Mermaid business was still mainly a hardware business manufacturing monitors for digital signage. After an early period with DVD players connected locally to the monitors, they soon realised that they needed software to manage the signage online. After searching abroad they found a local product in Denmark from Victor Soft and in 2005 they bought part of the company to acquire ownership of the software.</p>\r\n<p>After landing a large order from the retail chain Matas, ambitions grew and at a European trade show in Paris in 2006 Mermaid realised that their products were miles ahead of competing offers. So they decided to go international and get equity capital from the First North marketplace in 2007. First North is an alternative market, operated by the different exchanges within NASDAQ OMX. First North is an alternative to the regulated market, with less strict requirements and rules.</p>\r\n<p>In December 2007 they added another stone to the foundation when they acquired a major competitor, Acrossmedia, who had content production as a core part of their business model. This made Mermaid the dominant player in digital signage in Denmark.</p>\r\n<p>Acquisitions were not just about growing in volume, but also about adding products and competences to the palette. By adding software and content production they also created the foundation for a different business model, where hardware sales were not the goal in itself, but rather a means to make recurring revenue on additional services.</p>\r\n<p>Henrik Johnsen had obviously learned an important lesson about the vulnerability of a business model based on hardware sales in the first Mermaid Technology venture.</p>\r\n<p>The acquisition of volume and additional products and competences continued in the other Scandinavian countries and can be illustrated by the timeline in Table 3:</p>\r\n<p>Table 3: Timeline for acquisitions</p>\r\n<table summary="""" border=""1""><colgroup> <col width=""26.30%"" /> <col width=""73.40%"" /> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>July 2004:</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Mermaid founded and buying assets from the original Mermaid Technology.</p>\r\n<p>First contract on digital signage.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>October 2005:</td>\r\n<td>Acquiring software through 50% of shares in Victor Soft.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>December 2005:</td>\r\n<td>Acquiring the remaining 50% of Victor Soft.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>April 2007:</td>\r\n<td>Mermaid stocks for sale on the First North marketplace.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>December 2007:</td>\r\n<td>Acquiring Acrossmedia.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>January 2008:</td>\r\n<td>Establishing Mermaid Technology AS, Norway.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>January 2009:</td>\r\n<td>Acquiring Norden Media solutions AB, Sweden.

And to quote Henrik Johnsen, he is constantly thinking about &lsquo;adding the next stone to the foundation&rsquo;. Until now the new &lsquo;stones&rsquo; have been picked for their ability to add new technologies and services to the total Mermaid solution package in combination with their ability to add new markets and customers to reach the goal of market domination in the Nordic countries &ndash; an ambition that was recently upgraded to market domination in Europe.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore the introduction of stocks on the First North marketplace has obviously required an elaborate business plan and a clear strategy.</p>\r\n<p>Acquisitions are planned and decided in cooperation with the business partner and chairman of the board, S&oslash;ren Svenningsen. The process typically starts with a decision to go into a certain market. Research is conducted about the market and companies in the market. Relevant companies are then contacted. The process before the actual acquisition is effectuated typically lasts half a year.</p>\r\n<p>It may sound like an aggressive strategy where Mermaid is chasing potential skills and customer bases to acquire, but during the interview Mr Johnsen seemed a bit surprised when he realised that three of the acquisitions actually contacted Mermaid first with the intention of selling.</p>\r\n<p>Even though the big master plan may not be very explicit, the company has gradually developed procedures for the acquisition process ranging from a checklist for potential acquisitions to the whole process of integrating different companies and cultures.</p>\r\n<p>People who are going to work together in the future will start working together in a project team that takes care of the integration process; to Henrik Johnsen it is important to make employees of the acquired company feel equal in the project group. During the integration process, Mermaid A/S spends a lot of time convincing new staff why they have a future in the company and the project group is in constant dialogue over Skype throughout the process. Since acquisitions have been driven by the technology and skills in the acquired company, it is also important to keep the employees and their know-how.</p>\r\n<p>The support manager (customer support) who was originally working for Acrossmedia remembers a &lsquo;100+100+100-plan&rsquo; for the process where the project manager made a plan with milestones and actions for three periods of a hundred days. According to the support manager this made it very clear what would happen.</p>\r\n<p>The support manager was completely taken aback when he got the information that Acrossmedia was being sold to Mermaid. At the information meeting he expected to hear something about a new order. At the time of the Swedish acquisition he knew a bit in advance, but not about the Norwegian acquisitions. But he feels no need to know more about the acquisitions before they become a fact, and he hopes that more acquisitions will come in the near future since he would like to secure his job in Mermaid for many years.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2011, after a long period of restructuring events, the top management was split between Henrik Johnsen and co-owner Mads Henrik Hansen (original founder of Victor Soft), who is now in charge of operations. In relation to acquisitions Henrik Johnsen now simply delegates a large block called &lsquo;operations&rsquo; to Mads Henrik Hansen.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>One of the challenges for Mermaid is that restructuring has not been a single event but a continuous series of events.</p>\r\n<p>As a former elite handball player, Henrik Johnsen is very focused on creating a hard-working and committed team with strong players in all positions. People need to agree to long workdays and accept that the reward will come later. The formula is simple: workdays from 7 to 18 hours and below average wages (working hours are not regulated by law, but based on agreements with unions and local agreements in each company). This has not caused problems with acquisitions, since they are often in a weak financial position and used to below average wages. But the turnover in staff is low except for a few sales people who were tempted by considerably higher salary opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>However, Mr Johnsen acknowledges that continuous acquisitions and working excessively can wear people out: &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t relax when we have reached a goal. Some people are getting worn out, and we cannot get the same resources out of our staff that we could before. In the long run, a company cannot be based on people working hard all the time&rsquo;, he says.</p>\r\n<p>This is a major reason why Mermaid is now establishing project teams for all major projects in the company. This means that there is a managed process for each project managed by a project group &ndash; in acquisition projects with representatives for both organisations. Before that everybody was involved in everything.</p>\r\n<p>Being a larger organisation also means Mermaid can now establish specialist functions with more specialists so they are less dependent on individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Even though Mr Johnsen is concerned about the extra workload for some employees, it does not seem to worry the support manager. From his perspective, the integration of new acquired companies appears to be more a gradual learning process than something that is turning their work upside down. For the support manager, the integration of a new acquisition has mainly involved learning about new hardware/software and learning a new language (Swedish) to be able to support new customers. Learning about software was in dialogue with the Swedish acquisition and language was learned through a language course. From his perspective the constant growth leads to increased responsibility and continual learning.</p>\r\n<p>Even though he finds inspiration in learning about new cultures, the support manager also emphasises the challenges of integrating different work styles and the difficulty in understanding the subtle details and especially dialects in a different language. Today Mermaid has employed a native Swede in the support function.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, the addition of Swedish customers has increased the workload for the support department, but the extra time has been taken from Danish customers. &lsquo;We do what we have to do, but we have to prioritise harder&rsquo;, as he says.</p>\r\n<p>He also experienced how the willingness to cooperate in acquired companies is important when systems must be integrated, particularly when there is a lot of tacit knowledge in the acquired company that must be passed over. The Swedish subsidiary might have felt that they were being downgraded, and since the Swedish developers had been laid off they were not able to train the supporters in their system. This was not a problem in Norway since they had a well structured support function and were able to help themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Since the support manager was originally employed in one of the first and biggest acquisitions, Acrossmedia he has also experienced challenges in acquisitions from the acquired company&rsquo;s side. In the case of Acrossmedia the big challenge was the clash of cultures.</p>\r\n<p>Where Mermaid&rsquo;s history and culture has its roots in production, Acrossmedia was rooted in a partnership between marketing and multimedia skills. Where Acrossmedia was the archetypical creative company with table football as an integrated part of the workday and structure was a swearword, Mermaid was dominated by engineers and technicians with a more structured approach to business.</p>\r\n<p>For the creative staff it was a huge challenge to lose some of the benefits like flexible work hours and loose structure they had in Acrossmedia, but for people like the support staff it was a blessing to get more structure and better tools. The support manager felt that in the new culture the management was listening to him and took his problems more seriously.</p>\r\n<p>From the original staff at Acrossmedia one from the creative staff was laid off after the acquisition and three others decided to leave voluntarily.</p>\r\n<p>From the employee perspective it seems like the project organisation of acquisitions has been working well during the recent acquisitions. He attended three or four meetings where everything was planned. However, the project of integrating Acrossmedia seemed to show the limitations of a small organisation. The 100+100+100-plan seemed like a great plan to the support manager, but because people had their everyday operations as well, they sometimes lost focus on the project plan and did not follow up on the planned milestones and actions. Some of the tasks from the first 100 days were passed on into the next 100 days, and the plan for the last 100 days was never really made explicit to the support manager. In general, he felt the need to know exactly what to do and when &ndash; and somebody to &lsquo;knock me in the head more often&rsquo; as he says. This has not been a problem in later acquisition projects though.</p>\r\n<p>However, with future acquisitions Henrik Johnsen anticipates a more complicated process. Until now, the acquisitions have mainly been about adding new competences. This basically means that all employees in the target company are still needed, but the next acquisitions might very well bring along a more competitive agenda. &lsquo;Now we have it all, so with the next acquisition we have to consider who is holding the best competences&rsquo;, Henrik Johnsen says, since the purpose of new acquisitions will mainly be expansion into new markets.</p>\r\n<p>It may involve centralisation of functions in the mother company, but if this involves cutting away functions in the Danish mother company there may be a loyalty issue with the original employees who have made sacrifices in the early days. This is still a hypothetical problem though, and not an issue where Mr Johnsen has experienced specific concerns among employees.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, Henrik Johnsen also mentions the access to funding as a challenge, when you grow through acquisitions. Frequent acquisitions also mean that you regularly have to think about raising money.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The Trade Council under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has conducted market research on new markets for Mermaid. This is a special offer, where SMEs can get market research in a market of their own choice at half the normal price.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from that, Mermaid has not received public advice or support in connection with the acquisitions. However, Mermaid participated in a spinoff-project under the regional business service centre V&aelig;ksthus Hovedstadsregionen. The purpose of the project was to help a group of companies develop new spinoffs. During this project Mermaid developed a new spin-off project in media sales, where Mermaid A/S is selling ads on their installed hardware. The spin-off is now integrated as a new business area in the company (not a separate spin-off).</p>\r\n<p>Even though Mermaid was entitled to public funding for the project they said &lsquo;no thanks&rsquo;. Henrik Johnsen reasons that it would be indecent to ask for money when they got a profitable business out of it. If they had wasted their time participating in the project, they might have asked for the money.</p>\r\n<p>The problem with a state fund is in this case that they are not risking their own money and that decisions are made by a small group of people with no money at stake themselves.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring has required a lot of extra work, but long hours and a good work ethic is part of the culture at Mermaid. Because of the low earnings, wages remained unchanged in 2007&ndash;2009, but better earnings have led to small increases in wages in 2010&ndash;2011.</p>\r\n<p>Some acquired companies have paid lower wages since they have been struggling, so there has been some harmonisation in wages there to match the general Mermaid level. But in general, Mermaid is not a leader when it comes to wages.</p>\r\n<p>An important part of the mainly intuitive evaluation process of potential acquisitions is the evaluation of the work ethic and whether there is a lavish or a thrifty culture. Cost awareness is an important part of the culture in Mermaid.</p>\r\n<p>The acquisitions have not caused layoffs in the mother company, but layoffs of one or two employees have been necessary to improve profitability in some of the acquired companies and some time after the original Victor Soft and Acrossmedia were located at the same address in Aarhus, two people from the overlapping departments were laid off.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, the Norwegian subsidiary is performing as planned and making a small profit, but in 2010 the management was replaced as the subsidiary was not contributing to overall profitability. The Swedish subsidiary is still struggling to make a profit, but is expected to break even in 2012. Adding recurring revenue to their current installed bases is an important element in this.</p>\r\n<p>According to Henrik Johnsen, it is important for performance to create a sense of equality and mutual respect between colleagues in acquired companies and the mother company.</p>\r\n<p>Even though the financial crisis in 2008 stopped the order flow, Mermaid A/S decided to keep the staff and did not lay off any employees because of the crisis. They expected the market to recover and they did not want to let highly skilled people go, who were too good and important for the future.</p>\r\n<p>This period of overcapacity drained the bottom line, but according to Henrik Johnsen it was important to keep his employees as long as possible.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>In Henrik Johnsen&rsquo;s view, the major difference between restructuring in SMEs and in large corporations is communication. In an SME the communication flow can be much more informal. On the other hand, you also need to be able to communicate everything and see each other as colleagues.</p>\r\n<p>He also thinks that negative restructuring is easier in SMEs. It is easier to ask people to accept a cut in salary &ndash; if they get something in return like ownership or bonus.</p>\r\n<p>As an owner-manager in an SME it is also easier to be honest with your staff and tell them exactly what the situation is. And since you have been in the boat all the way and have taken your turns, it is easier to ask people to do the same.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to disadvantages of being an SME in a restructuring process he points out the access to funding. It is hard to make a long-term investment strategy when you have to raise money continuously.</p>\r\n<p>He also mentions the increasing workload on key employees who literally work day and night. Entrepreneurs need people with a work ethic like themselves.</p>\r\n<p>From the employee perspective the support manager thinks that it is an advantage in an SME that you do not have to involve a lot of middle managers in the restructuring process. You do not have to convert as many people, as he says. On the other hand he sees the lack of capital and resources to move the process forward as the main disadvantage. He also likes the way SMEs can easily bring people together to get to know each other and get the same information. However, he also finds it important that management is selective when they give information. He does not feel that he needs to know everything.</p>\r\n<p>Looking back on the process, Mr Johnsen wishes that he had restructured the top management earlier. The restructuring has made delegating things easier for Henrik Johnsen. &lsquo;If you have key employees you shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to give them a share of the company. Then you don&rsquo;t waste your energy thinking &ldquo;what if I lose him&rdquo;&rsquo;, Henrik Johnsen reflects.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Jan Bendtsen, Syddansk Universitet, Kolding, Denmark.</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>Interviews</p>\r\n<p>Henrik Johnsen, CEO and founder, and Henrik S.

"PAA Baths, Latvia"~"PAA Baths Ltd."~"<p>PAA Baths is a leading Latvian manufacturer of high-quality bathtubs, washbasins, shower trays and bathroom furniture.  Restructuring was triggered by the economic downturn in 2008 when sales decreased by 70% and export levels reached only 40% of the previous year. The company managed to survive and thrive by refocusing its objectives, acquiring foreign investment capital that allowed it to expand its customer base and diversifying its product range while lowering costs and prices.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>РАА Ltd was founded in 1993 by three friends – a doctor, a physicist and a carpenter – and is a 100% Latvian-based enterprise. The founders are still the owners of the company and all are active in the management of the firm. The idea behind the foundation of the company was to manufacture a bath using innovative materials, previously used only in aeromechanics. The idea was to create an original, high-quality acrylic bathtub that would be more durable, attractive and practical than baths made from cast-iron. After months of persistent work, encouraged by friends and blessed by good luck, the founders created the first bathtub. In 1996 the technology of cast stone was introduced. At present PAA Baths uses three technologies: acrylic, cast stone, and glass fibre-polyester resin technology and is a leading Latvian manufacturer of bathtubs, washbasins, shower trays and bathroom furniture for individual orders. </p>\r\n<p>The company occupies a unique niche among the wide range of other producers, focusing on serving individual customer needs in product design, size and color. PAA Baths specialises in exclusive production. The firm’s main customers are people interested in expensive, exclusive products. PAA Baths also offer products for ‘middle range’ customers. </p>\r\n<p>PAA Baths has an advantage over competitors, because the size of the firm gives an opportunity to be flexible (which means that the firm can easily change the variety and assortment of products it produces). Another important advantage is having a plant located near the headquarters of the firm. The company has owned the plant since 1999. This has allowed PAA to be less dependent of the changing situation and costs in a time of economic downturn: many other manufacturers renting their premises were tied to long term contracts based on the ‘high prices of good years’ and thus had limited options but to close their business due to high fixed costs.</p>\r\n<p>PAA started exporting to Lithuania and Ukraine in 1999. At present, PAA Baths exports almost 40% of its production to eleven countries: Lithuania, Estonia, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, UK, Poland, France, Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. PAA uses two main strategies to enter foreign markets. Firstly, PAA produces under their own brand name and export through different wholesale dealers, sales representatives and joint ventures. Secondly, the firm manufactures shower-trays that are sold under the client’s own brand name, too.</p>\r\n<p>The number of employees has not been not constant during last few years, due to the 2008–2009 crisis. The main figures are presented below: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Maximum number of employees at PAA (mid-2008) – in\r\ntotal 107, with around 70 at the manufacturing plant;</li>\r\n<li>Minimum number of employees at PAA (mid-2009) – a\r\ntotal of 38, with 28 in the plant;</li>\r\n<li>Number of employees at PAA at the end of 2011 –65\r\nin total, with around 50 in the plant;</li>\r\n<li>Average age of employees: 30–45 years. In the\r\nfactory there are also many very young workers.</li>\r\n<li>Education: in the office 95% have higher education; in\r\nthe factory mainly secondary education.</li>\r\n<li>Gender: in the office 20% men, 80% women; in the factory\r\n85% men, 15% women.</li>\r\n<li>There is no works council in the company.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The major challenges for PAA Bath came with the economic downturn in 2008. As a result of the crisis, sales decreased by 70% and export levels reached only 40% of the previous year. This in turn influenced the company's income levels both on the Latvian market and abroad. Declining demand also led to reducing the number of employees, from 107 to 38. </p>\r\n<p>To overcome these problems, the company decided to change several aspects inside the business. The two key decisions directly related to the restructuring are as follows: reduction of some production lines; and opening a new broad market in western Europe and eastern Asia with Premium-class products. The financial crisis forced PAA to retain only the best-selling products in its product portfolio. At the same time, being focused mainly on high quality and high price segment customers, PAA was looking for new markets abroad with the intention to expand in this market niche.</p>\r\n<p>These two facts in turn implied a focus on even better production quality by PAA, including implementing changes in the management process, but even more importantly in the process of product design and manufacturing. Thus, the main reason for the restructuring process was closely linked with the necessity for technological progress within the company to satisfy the wishes and requirements of potential customers. To do that, new modern equipment had to be considered, the production process optimised, as well as introducing new types of production that correspond to the high-tech trends in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>PAA started with an internal restructuring without having a formal restructuring plan, as, according to the company representatives, in such a situation one should react very fast and there is no time for writing plans or other documents. The first decision of PAA was to implement changes with regard to the variety of goods sold. The company stopped the production of three different lines – upper segment products, targeted at high income customers (SKY line), medium segment products (SUN line) and economy segment products, mainly targeted at budget customers (SEE line) – and introduced a new catalogue which included only the best-selling items. All these decisions reflected changes in consumer preferences and required both understanding and support from employees. Thus, from the very beginning of the restructuring process, the company did their best to inform employees about the forthcoming changes, using informal ways of communication, such as face-to-face conversations with key people, as well as through various meetings devoted to discussing the way changes would be implemented, and information sent via e-mails, etc. </p>\r\n<p>The next decision related to restructuring within PAA Baths was to expand this catalogue with new products that would correspond to emerging customers’ needs. More specifically, PAA increased production using cast stone materials. Cast stone was previously not widely used in the production of bathtubs, yet the costs were lower than the cost of more commonly used materials. During the economic downturn, people are more cautious in their spending, thus by decreasing production costs at the same time as offering a good-quality product, PAA met the market demand. </p>\r\n<p>PAA created several new models: TRE, TRE GRANDE, UNO, and GRANDE. Customers perceived these models to be more appealing and high grade (one of the characteristics of cast stone is to shine), yet they could be offered at a lower price. As a result, PAA managed to sell a substantial amount of this product line. </p>\r\n<p>As previously, PAA continued to offer good-quality baths with an individual approach to each consumer when it came to choosing colour, size and other features. In sum, PAA aimed at providing customers with an exclusive product. With such a strategy, it was only logical to make the next step and open new markets in western Europe and eastern Asia, focusing on the upper-class segment. </p>\r\n<p>It turned out that customers in these new markets were more interested in quality and design than price. Following this demand, PAA created a new type of production with more fashion design and using more modern materials: the company started using solid surface materials and produced a new line of product. According to the export manager of PAA, Mrs Lipsane: ‘We understood that if we offered the product that we have right now, we would not be competitive and would sell nothing’.  Altogether, this aspect of the restructuring process that is often labeled as ‘business expansion’ took approximately one year to implement. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The main challenges facing PAA related to its operations in the high price and quality segment during the economic downturn. During the crisis customer income decreased. The material and forms for casting were very expensive; that is why the company needed a big turnover to produce new products. When sales were low, however, the company lacked money to buy a new batch of material, which made serving customers’ needs rather complicated. </p>\r\n<p>One of the most important points of restructuring was entering a new market. This was a good opportunity to explore the business, but it implied a lot of risks. To reduce such risks the company had to allocate a person who was responsible for organisational issues, knew the legislation and also the specifics of each market (such as extensive bribing in Post-Soviet countries: this person should know how to deal with such situations). Attracting new, qualified person costs money, and lack of money was indeed a challenge both for PAA, as well as many other companies in the market. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring process in PAA Baths is ongoing today, one of the reasons being the bankruptcy of one of the Latvian banks: Latvijas Krajbanka (Baltic News Network, 2011). PAA was about to receive a transaction of €10,000 through Latvijas Krajbanka when the bank went bankrupt, and therefore had major problems with cash: the transaction was made by a customer, yet never reached PAA Baths due to the bankruptcy of the bank. What makes this even more complicated is that PAA had to pay most of this money to its suppliers, thus the whole process of manufacturing was influenced with this transaction. </p>\r\n<p>As acknowledged by the export manager of PAA Baths, the most challenging issue about doing business is uncertainty: ‘…we cannot be sure what will happen tomorrow, and no one is insured against failures’. That is why restructuring processes need planning, but this plan can change depending on external factors like changing market conditions, including changes in supply and demand, price fluctuations; the political situation at home and abroad; inflation; and the activities of the government.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>The entry into the new market and all other changes in production had to be supported by the technological part of the venture. This issue was solved by participation in the annual competition ‘Prize for export and innovation – 2010’ (organised by the Ministry of Economy of Latvia and the State Agency ‘Latvian Investment and Development Agency’) where PAA Baths won first place in the category ‘Industrial Design’. PAA Baths used this special grant, approximately €300,000, to change its equipment. This in turn allowed the company to successfully implement the restructuring process, that is, start producing an absolutely new line of products that in turn led both to a more effective manufacturing process and an increase of the workforce. The new equipment (new machines) also allowed the company to produce more output including new types of baths. This is of particular importance since the business expansion aspect of restructuring depends on the production of new, more prestigious varieties of baths, intended to be sold to wealthier clients, enabling PAA to expand and set up new shops in western Europe and Hong Kong.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the Latvian Investment and Development Agency provided the contact and also paid for the work of an American marketing expert, who helps PAA baths. ‘I think that marketing makes up two thirds of our success, therefore the assistance of this American marketing expert is very useful’, commented Ingura Lipsane. The American marketing expert introduced new features of marketing based on their experience in the USA; it allows the firm to carry out a very successful marketing strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>One of the most important outcomes of restructuring of PAA was to increase the number of employees from 35 to 65. Indeed, in order to keep up with the increased production that resulted from entering new markets and launching new products, more workers were needed. The good news is that all this has also led to better performance in financial terms. Namely, the profit forecast for 2012 was higher than for previous years. Restructuring also increased the overall competitiveness of PAA: something that was crucial to simply stay in the market. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring has led to the change in the firm’s main objectives. As explained by the export manager of PAA: ‘At the beginning (of the restructuring) the simple idea of survival in the very difficult market situation was the most important aim.’ Now it has brought a new direction into PAA’s export structure in order to expand in new directions and new (higher) market segments. In sum, currently the key focus is on the continuous development and growth of the company, rather than survival. Yet, even development plans include recovering from the losses that were made during the peak of the financial crisis. </p>\r\n<p>Attracting more foreign investors is another objective set by the company owners after the restructuring process. PAA is looking for investors that could support the purchase of modern equipment, that, in turn, would increase the quality of products, reduce costs and increase the export share as well as sales in Latvia.</p>\r\n<p>As further emphasised by the export manager, the current production still generates substantial cash inflow. Yet, it is expected that soon sales might peak and might not continue to grow. Therefore, the company has developed the following future plans:</p>\r\n<p><b>Step 1:</b> This step has already started and will continue until mid-2012. It includes creating a new product brand. This brand, or collection to be more specific, is targeted at customers that can pay a premium for the quality. High quality designer Massimo Farinatti has been invited to deal with design issues and thus make the offer as attractive as possible. Apart from developing the brand name and working on the design, PAA focuses also on improving the manufacturing process within this step. </p>\r\n<p><b>Step 2</b>: The second step started at the beginning of 2012. The key here is finding a strategic partner and launching a pilot project for strengthening presence in global markets (especially Asia: the company plans to start with Hong Kong). Further plans include western Europe. </p>\r\n<p><b>Step 3:</b> The third step is to create global brand awareness by participation in trade shows (ISH in Frankfurt; Milan). It is planned to have some results with regards to step 3 by 2013. The main goals are further expansion into global markets.</p>\r\n<p>All these plans are mainly possible because of processes that have already happened. Another outcome of the restructuring process is the usage of new components in the production process. This allowed diversification of the product range, expanding target markets and, importantly, reducing costs and thus also price. Altogether, it led to an increase in the number of employees, which, in turn, required improving human resource management systems within the company. This includes improving the work of the human resource department, mainly by fostering better communication between management of the company and employees as well as amongst firm employees themselves.</p>\r\n<p>All in all, as a result of the restructuring process, PAA Bath was able to make some significant changes that allowed the company to survive the period after the economic downturn in 2008. Even though the company lost a considerable amount of money during that time, it still managed to survive and regain its reputation on both local and foreign markets. This was mainly possible by refocusing objectives, an inflow of foreign investment that allowed searching for prospective clients in western Europe and eastern Asia, and, finally, through the diversification of the product range at the same time lowering costs and prices.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>PAA can be considered as quite a unique company. Founded by three friends from scratch, during its best times the company has managed to reach turnover of approximately €4 million (2007). The competitive advantage of PAA compared to other players in the segment is the individual approach to each customer, that is, people can choose the size, model and color of the baths and other goods offered by PAA. </p>\r\n<p>The major reason for restructuring at PAA was the economic downturn. Even though crises are usually perceived negatively (and not without reason), this one pushed PAA to think in different directions in order to increase its competitiveness both in local markets and abroad. This was achieved by restructuring that, in fact is far from over as the company is constantly facing new challenges, namely, changes in the production process, improved sales and a marketing approach following new objectives, and using new materials. These are all prerequisites to take further steps, as described above. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Authors </h2>\r\n<p>Margarita Cernova, Raman Nakazny and Aliaksei Chekel</p>\r\n<p>Edited by Arnis Sauka</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interview</h3>\r\n<p>Ingura Lipshane, Export Manager</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Company website</h3>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.paabaths.com/"">http://www.paabaths.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Secondary sources</h3>\r\n<p>ckct.org.ru: <a HREF=""http://www.ckct.org.ru/study/ep/ep1-1.shtml"">http://www.ckct.org.ru/study/ep/ep1-1.shtml</a></p>\r\n<p><a HREF=""http://www.liaa.lv/"">http://www.liaa.lv/</a> </p>\r\n<p><i>Baltic News Network</i>., from bnn-news.com: <a HREF=""http://bnn-news.com/30-40-merchants-restored-functionality-payment-terminals-42654"">http://bnn-news.com/30-40-merchants-restored-functionality-payment-terminals-42654</a></p>\r\n<p><i>seekingalpha.com</i>: <a HREF=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/179756-latvia-back-in-the-news-with-more-to-come"">http://seekingalpha.com/article/179756-latvia-back-in-the-news-with-more-to-come</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Latvia"~"23 - manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products"~"10-49"~"50-249"~"globalisation*recession/crisis"~"business expansion*internal restructuring"~"2011-12-14"
"Technofluid, Belgium"~"Technofluid"~"<p>Company funds and two bank loans of €2 million each were used to fund restructuring by Technofluid, a Belgian firm that originally sold pneumatic and hydraulic equipment. Changes in the company included a new business philosophy and human resource policy, relocation and expansion into a new line of business, photovoltaic solar panels, as well as growing its original area of business. The restructuring spanned the years 2004–2009, involved regular consultation and ballots of staff and led to substantial growth in turnover.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile </h2>\r\n<p>Technofluid S.A. is a company involved in the sale and distribution of wholesale machinery for industry, specifically compressed air production, pneumatic components, instrumentation, hydraulic components and vacuum pumps. In 2009 Technofluid launched a new product line the installation and maintenance of photovoltaic panels, via another company, Technosun S.A. </p>\r\n<p>Technofluid’s and Technosun’s main premises are in the industrial zone of Awans, close to the city of Liege, in the Wallonia Region – the French-speaking part of Belgium. The company also has premises in Wetteren, close to the city of Ghent, Flemish Region, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. Moreover, Technofluid has a branch in a sister company, Belgian Instrumentation Products BVBA/SPRL, in Herentals, close to Antwerp, employing five people.</p>\r\n<p>Technofluid was founded in 1968 by Henri Bouhy and his wife. One of their sons, Jean-Luc Bouhy joined the company in 1986 and became the general manager two years later due to the health problems of his father. Jean-Luc Bouhy is a qualified electromechanical civil engineer and also holds an MBA business degree <i>Haute École de Commerce </i> of Liege. </p>\r\n<p>The company is held by a family holding company, Technohold S.A. There are no other firms in Technohold apart from Technofluid and Technosun. Employment figures given below are for both Technofluid and Technosun. The purpose of this corporate structure is to separate the management from the company, including to ‘professionalise’ it by separating it from family emotions.</p>\r\n<p>Until recently Technofluid had approximately 50 employees. With the launch of the photovoltaic panel activities, the company hired approximately 30 additional staff. In 2012, Technofluid /Technosun had 85 employees approximately, including the management. The management is composed of 12 employees, including Jean-Luc Bouhy and his two sons. Most of the workforce has a higher vocational diploma (<i>graduat</i>). Some workers have no diplomas, but the company has five engineers and a couple of additional employees with a university degree. </p>\r\n<p>The company’s activities are mainly carried out on a local or national basis. The geographical split of the company’s activities is as follows: </p>\r\n<TABLE border=""1"" summary="""">\r\n<COLGROUP>\r\n      <COL width=""33.20%"">\r\n      <COL width=""33.20%"">\r\n      <COL width=""33.20%"">\r\n</COLGROUP>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n </TD>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">Traditional activities</TH>\r\n<TH class=""TableHeadRow"">Photovoltaic panels</TH>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<b>Local </b> (within a 30-km radius)</TD>\r\n<TD>20%</TD>\r\n<TD>80%</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD><b>National</b></TD>\r\n<TD>79%</TD>\r\n<TD>20%</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD><b>International</b></TD>\r\n<TD>1%</TD>\r\n<TD>0%</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Following the above-mentioned increase of personnel, Technofluid now meets the legal thresholds under which a company can be obliged to set up a union delegation (<i>delegation </i> <i>syndicale</i>). (Under Belgian law a company employing at least 50 people may be requested by one of the three official trade unions to set up a union delegation.) Social elections are currently (summer 2012) being organised within Technofluid. </p>\r\n<p>Since 2005, the average turnover of Technofluid steadily grew from approximately €8 million to €10 million per year. In 2010 and 2011, turnover increased to €12 million and then to €23 million.</p>\r\n<p>The interviewed employee, Anita Rouvrois, has worked at Technofluid for over 30 years. She has a higher vocational diploma in office work and currently holds the position of Administrative Coordinator in the compressed-air department. In the past, she held a similar position in the pneumatic components department.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The triggering event is a single and unplanned event, namely a moment of insight that the general manager experienced at a seminar on management he attended in 2004. By ‘moment of insight’ it is meant that he understood in a new way what mattered to him in terms of management, that is to run his business in a more ‘human’ way, with a clear mission statement and clear values shared by everyone and by taking into account the viewpoint of employees and promoting the well-being of everyone. He subsequently found the energy to work on it and implement it. The restructuring that took place within Technofluid is thus not linked to general tendencies on the market and can be traced back to a single moment. </p>\r\n<p>The development of photovoltaic panel activities is due to a fortuitous event. Technofluid’s management, wanting a ‘green’ building as new premises, decided to purchase photovoltaic panels that would cover half of the surface of its roof. The vendor they contacted refused to carry out the job; Technofluid then decided it would do it itself. </p>\r\n<p>The general manager was well aware of photovoltaic panels in Belgium back then because he had investigated the sector on behalf of his brother (but not for Technofluid). Indeed, the brother, active in the compressed air dryer sector, was at the time seeking product diversification, hence the knowledge of Mr Bouhy. The decision to move into photovoltaic could thus be taken quickly. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring event which took place at Technofluid is an internal restructuring, consisting of implementing a new human resource and management policy, which resulted in the development and the launch of a new product line, namely the installation and maintenance of photovoltaic panels. The restructuring event is thus furthermore a business expansion consisting in the offering of a new product line. It caused the creation of about 30 additional jobs and an increase of turnover of almost 100% in 2011 (from € 12 million in 2010 to € 23 million in 2011). </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring event went on for several years and can be split into several milestones:</p>\r\n<p>(i)	<i>Definition of a new course of action for managing the company:</i></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2004 – general manager’s insight during a\r\nmanagement seminar.  </li>\r\n<li>2004 – definition of the company’s corporate\r\nvalues, by working groups, including the staff. This results in the adoption of\r\na corporate charter containing 10 chapters, on the company’s values such\r\nas ‘team spirit’, ‘respect’,\r\n‘responsibility’, ‘honesty’, ‘dialogue’,\r\nprinciples regarding client management, and so on.  </li>\r\n<li>2004–2006 – coaching sessions and advice for\r\nsenior management from professionals and consultants. </li>\r\n<li>2006 – launching a human resource policy on the\r\nbasis of the ‘Investors in People’ international methodology.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>(ii)	<i>Relocation:</i></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2006 – submission of four projects on changes in\r\nthe management of the company (new location of premises for example) to the vote\r\nof the board of directors, the employees and the suppliers. The project to move\r\npremises was rejected by the board of directors but this was followed by a\r\nmassive vote by employees in favour of the project. It took two additional board\r\nmeetings to obtain the final decision to relocate premises. </li>\r\n<li>2008 – overwhelming vote by employees in favour of\r\nthe moving the company to new premises. The board endorses this decision, which\r\nleads to relocation, still within the Liege Province.  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>(iii)	<i>Activity expansion:</i></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2009 – moving to the industrial zoned area of\r\nAwans, which allows for two things, <i>(i)</i> the development of new\r\nactivities requiring more space, such as large-scale compressed air operations;\r\nand <i>(ii)</i> the development of photovoltaic panel activities. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The restructuring event was not planned. Consequently, there was no plan to implement and no record of implementation or adjustments. Moreover, no other options were considered than the ones mentioned above.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring was funded by two loans from banks, of €2 million each. These loans financed the acquisition of two new premises and the remainder was funded with the company’s own funds. Mr Bouhy does not specify whether these loans were difficult to obtain or not. </p>\r\n<p>Early on, employees were involved throughout the process via regular meetings and votes, including a vote on whether or not to move premises. In total, five staff ballots were organised. Additional meetings with specific teams or categories of employees were also set up. Since 2009, the management has organised a yearly plenary event where the results of the previous year are explained as well as the course of action for the following year. </p>\r\n<p>Ms Rouvrois confirms that employees were involved throughout the restructuring process, as described above. No important decision was taken without prior consultation, and sometimes a vote, of employees. She sees this as positive as she feels employees are not ‘<i>mis devant le fait accompli</i>’ (confronted with already decided issues). She reports that some people gossiped extensively during the restructuring process. This generated fears and uncertainties among workers, which were greatly reduced thanks to the open policy implemented by the management. For instance, the general manager set up meetings whose purpose was to talk openly about ongoing change. This reduced the amount of rumours. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The management faced some issues and challenges during the restructuring process. First, a dispute arose between the general manager and two other directors, a family member and the sales manager. The two directors were systematically opposed to the restructuring event and eventually left the company. The new corporate structure, the creation of a family holding company to separate the family from the day-to-day management of the company, is partly explained by this event. Second, the general manager suffered from health problems during 2006 and got help from health professionals as well as from management coaches and other professional consultants. </p>\r\n<p>Ms Rouvrois confirms that some workers were strongly opposed to the restructuring process but she feels that, globally, the restructuring event was perceived as positive by numerous employees. She certainly sees the restructuring event as positive, with figures and results ‘speaking for themselves’. She does not see how things could have gone better.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support </h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Financial support</h3>\r\n<p>Besides the loan mentioned above, Technofluid had access to public funds (notably from the Wallonia Region) for training on human resources and management techniques that were implemented throughout the restructuring process. Mr Bouhy explains that these resources were effective as he would probably not have gone through the whole process without this financial support. He does not report any serious difficulty in accessing these support resources at the time.</p>\r\n<p>However, one improvement could be to cut down on the administrative burdens that he says could deter managers from using such funds. For instance, Mr Bouhy had to go through a preliminary social audit that was certainly useful but lasted three days and cost him a lot of time, energy and money.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Non-financial support</h3>\r\n<p>Mr Bouhy benefited from numerous non-financial supports, such as: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>consultancy services in human resources and management;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>personal development coaches; </li>\r\n<li>services from health professionals, including doctors;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>moral support from family and friends.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The general manager paid for the first three types of supports mentioned above. He received public funds in support of the services for training on human resources and management techniques. He is satisfied with the price/value ratio of these services. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring did not take place according to a pre-defined plan, so it is not possible to say whether it resulted in the planned outcome for the workers and the company. The restructuring event is globally perceived as positive, taking into account the excellent results that followed it (increase of turnover and of employee numbers).</p>\r\n<p> Regarding employment effects, it should be noted that there was: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>almost no negative numerical adjustments beside the\r\nlaying-off of the two directors mentioned above; </li>\r\n<li>no working time adjustments; </li>\r\n<li>an abolition of the obligation for employees to\r\n‘clock-in’; </li>\r\n<li>slightly more significant pay increases than in the past;\r\n</li>\r\n<li>substantial increases in staff training, in the fields of\r\nICT, other skills and in personal and professional development. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The willingness of the general manager to give more independence and responsibility to employees (such as the removal of the clock-in obligation) should also be noted. At the structural level, this has resulted in the creation of five main departments within the company, roughly corresponding to the main product categories offered. These departments have more autonomy than in the past. Reporting lines were made more flexible.</p>\r\n<p>The company’s management of course had to face employee reluctance, including strong opposition at times, but, as a general rule, the restructuring event was positively welcomed by most employees. A few people left the company, notably at Ghent. The general manager explains these departures by the fact that changes were implemented quickly and within a short time frame. By this, he does not mean that there was not enough time to deal with all the concerns of each employee, but simply that these people were reluctant to change whereas change occurred within a relatively short time frame. </p>\r\n<p>As far as the general manager is concerned personally, the restructuring event generated positive outcomes regarding his own assets and personal satisfaction. </p>\r\n<p>The general manager has plans for the future, notably refining his human resources and management strategy. A human resource director was hired and is based in the Ghent premises. Moreover, the general manager is currently working on his succession and the transfer of power. He also contemplates creating a new corporate structure, by splitting activities between different independent companies.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Rouvrois explained that she personally benefited from the restructuring. Before the restructuring event took place, she was very stressed in her position as administrative coordinator for pneumatic components. She attributes the stress to the short and numerous deadlines she had to face. She explains she could not cope with work and had to work extra hours on a regular basis, which caused her fatigue and stress. </p>\r\n<p>In the context of the ‘human restructuring’ described above, she understood that she too could improve her personal situation within the company so she worked on her problem and explained it to the management. Eventually, she and the management found a solution. Her new position, administrative coordinator for the compressed-air department, causes her less stress as she now has fewer deadlines and works on a longer-term basis, which suits her personality better. </p>\r\n<p>Following the restructuring event, she had access to training that was not available in the past, notably in ICT and technology. </p>\r\n<p>She explains that her relationship with other workers has not changed: it has always been very good. Her relationship with the management improved as the management is now more open to employees’ needs than in the past. She says the restructuring event created a more serene work atmosphere, in turn increasing productivity. She feels more focused on her work now and expects other colleagues are too. The team spirit has greatly improved. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Mr Bouhy believes that large companies are less flexible than SMEs in implementing change. This is notably due to the presence of trade unions that are often reluctant to change. On the other hand, large companies have more technical, human and/or financial resources for defining and implementing changes. </p>\r\n<p>If anything, Mr Bouhy would have done exactly the same thing 20 years earlier.  He recommends administrative simplification for access to public support for SMEs. He views support for ‘investing in people’ as a necessity. </p>\r\n<p>Ms Rouvrois underlines that job saving is more important for managers of SMEs than in larger companies and sees this as positive. She also believes that ‘investing in people’ is easier to implement in small companies than in larger ones. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Cécile Musialski, Philippe &amp; Partners</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information Sources</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Jean-Luc Bouhy, General Manager, and Anita Rouvrois, employee<a HREF="""">Error!

"Transamerico, Luxembourg"~"Transamerico "~"<p>When the Luxembourg firm Transamerico was split into two firms after the sudden death of its founder, all the decisions related to this had to be taken by his widow. However, she extensively involved the staff, who provided information, and actively participated by making calculations and providing analysis.</p>"~"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Background information on the company</h3>\r\n<p>Transamerico is a company registered under Luxembourg law, active in the transport and logistics sector (truck transportation). Transamerico S.A. was created in 1992 by Amérigo De Sousa Fernandes and his wife, Danielle Weber. It started operations on the international freight market and from 1995 onwards it was also operating on the national Luxembourg market. Nowadays, the company also has a vehicle hire business, mostly trucks and containers. </p>\r\n<p>In 2009, following the sudden tragic death of Mr De Sousa, the company’s activities were split into two different companies:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Transamerico Sàrl, in charge of international\r\ntransport; </li>\r\n<li>Transamerico &amp; Fils S.A., in charge of national\r\ntransport. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The purpose of the split was to separate activities that suffered from international competition – mostly from central-eastern European countries following the 2004 enlargement of the EU – from those which were more profitable: the national activities. Transamerico Sàrl eventually went bankrupt (2010), so the focus of the family’s activities became national – representing a major reduction in scale, given the small size of Luxembourg (2,600 sq km).</p>\r\n<p>At present, 90% of the activities of Transamerico &amp; Fils S.A. are located in Luxembourg, while the remaining 10% are in the ‘<i>Grande Région</i>’: the area of Saarland, Lorraine, Luxembourg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Wallonia situated between the Rhine, the Moselle, the Saar and the Meuse rivers. </p>\r\n<p>Transamerico &amp; Fils S.A. currently (spring/summer 2012) employs 23 staff: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>One manager, who is also the sole owner following Mr\r\nSouza’s death, Ms Weber; </li>\r\n<li>Two administrative staff: Daniel Marques, Technical\r\nDirector, and Yves Lefebvre, Operation Director;</li>\r\n<li>One mechanic; </li>\r\n<li>19 truck drivers. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Ms Weber’s daughters provide support when needed. Transamerico &amp; Fils S.A. qualifies as a company having to organise social elections, so the company currently has one workers’ representative, Mr Lefebvre. </p>\r\n<p>No one at Transamerico holds a university degree. Ms Weber learnt her function ‘on-the-job’, whereas Mr Marques and Lefebvre have a vocational diploma. Truck drivers generally do not hold any diploma or qualifications, apart from a licence to drive trucks. </p>\r\n<p>Since 2005, the performance of the business has decreased. In the three years 2009 to 2011 the turnover of Transamerico &amp; Fils S.A. was stable, oscillating between €2 million and €2.5 million. In 2011, it was € 2.3 million. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Marques, the employee interviewed for the purpose of the present case study, holds a vocational diploma in accounting. He has also undergone a training programme diploma delivered by the Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce for people who want to start their own business. In addition, he has had separate short-term training in transports and logistics. He joined Transamerico in 2007. Before this, he worked as an accountancy clerk in a small tax company in the country. He is currently technical director of the firm. He thus not only deals with the company accounts but also works on diverse tasks, such as the day-to-day management of the firm, including financial analysis of the profitability of trucks and routes. He is not in charge of logistics, maintenance or contacts with clients, which fall under the responsibility of Mr Lefebvre. </p>\r\n<p>The General Manager, Ms Weber, used to be only slightly involved in the company management, which was conducted by her husband, Mr De Souza. However, following Mr De Souza’s death she took over the management of the firm. It took her some time to gather the information necessary to carry out her functions, but thanks to the support of her employees, she eventually gained a full picture of the company’s functioning and took the decision to split the company in two (see above), including eventually to refocus activities on national markets. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The event triggering the restructuring process was the sudden death of Mr De Souza, coupled with increasing competition from central-eastern European countries following the enlargement of the EU in 2004 and sharp increases in oil prices. Trucks that were sent abroad found it increasingly difficult to find a client or a consignment for the homeward trip. </p>\r\n<p>The European road freight transport industry used to be dominated by the major economies. However, new Member States experienced substantial increases in their shares of the transport market following accession, with Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Lithuania serving 40% of the European market following their accession in 2008. With its small size and location at the heart of Western Europe, Luxembourg has particularly suffered from new Member States’ expansion into the market. </p>\r\n<p>The death of Mr De Souza forced Ms Weber to take a deep look into the company’s accounts, with the support of her office staff. The team eventually realised that international activities were getting increasingly worse and were threatening the viability of the whole company, whereas national activities were still profitable.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring processes</h2>\r\n<p>In order to protect the viable national activities, it was thus decided to split the company’s activities into two separate companies/activities, with Transamerico Sàrl in charge of international activities and Transamerico &amp; Fils S.A. in charge of local and national activities. The split was done with limited external support: advice from the accountant/auditor of the company and preparation of the legal documents by the law firm of the company. Employees working at the head office of the companies were of course informed of the split during the restructuring process due to their (physical) proximity to Ms Weber. Truck drivers were informed afterwards. </p>\r\n<p>The split turned out to be a positive way of managing things, as Transamerico Sàrl eventually went bankrupt in 2010. Since then, Transamerico &amp; Fils S.A. is doing relatively well (constant annual turnover of €2 million to €2.5 million), but Ms Weber acknowledges that times are hard and that prospects are not particularly good. </p>\r\n<p>Overall, the restructuring process lasted approximately two years. The restructuring was unplanned and did not follow a formal implementation plan. Ms Weber took the final decisions but closely involved her office employees in the process – they actively participated in calculations, analysis of the situation and similar tasks. She sometimes also consulted the truck drivers as well as the mechanic. The employees’ representative, Mr Lefebvre, was consulted just like any other employee. It appears from this that the workforce was kept aware of the restructuring at all stages. </p>\r\n<p>The interviewer got the impression that Transamerico’s staff  have formed close bonds, like being part of a family. As Mr De Souza’s death was sudden and shocking, employees closed ranks in support of Ms Weber and her three children. Everyone was very supportive of her and she in turn acted generously.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Ms Weber does not report any specific difficulty, apart from the fact that, for the first six months that followed Mr De Souza’s death, adjustments in daily management of the company were needed (there was difficulty in finding certain information, for example, and time then was on making up for missing information) as no one in the company had the overview Mr De Souza had had over his business. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support </h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring was not subject to specific financial support, internal or external. As far as non-financial support is concerned, Ms Weber benefited mostly from advice from auditors and accountants.  These were the regular advisers of the company and Ms Weber did not look for additional external expertise in addition to that already available. </p>\r\n<p>The restructuring was not funded by external resources and in fact the interviewer formed the impression that Transamerico’s management was not aware of any possibility of obtaining external funds. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>It is not possible to say that the restructuring went according to the initial plan as there was no real plan. The overall outcome of it is mixed. It is positive in that the split of the company in two allowed the viable national activities to be safeguarded. At the same time it is negative as the loss of international activities led to a major decrease in staff numbers, sales and turnover.  However, this last element is not really an outcome of the restructuring as it would have happened anyway, that is, without the restructuring event properly speaking. </p>\r\n<p>As far as staff cuts are concerned, it may be said that major job losses were avoided thanks to the restructuring as mostly voluntary departures and early retirements were necessary, according to Ms Weber. Only a few dismissals were necessary. </p>\r\n<p>Job retention was a major goal of Ms Weber, who has always felt close to her workforce in the SME environment. Over the 2008–2010 period, one mechanic and 16 truck-drivers left the firm progressively on a voluntary basis. Ms Weber did not reduce salaries so the remaining employees the same income as before restructuring. No special action was taken to support the employees who left the company. </p>\r\n<p>Overall, one may say that the general reaction of employees towards restructuring was good. As mentioned above, Transamerico has a kind of ‘family’ atmosphere and everyone has been supportive of Ms Weber and her children, who really had to go overcome a family tragedy. </p>\r\n<p>Mr Marques explains that the first six months that followed Mr De Souza’s death were difficult, as no one in the company had the knowledge that Mr De Souza had of his business. After a period of adjustment, things started to stabilise and work got reorganised. Mr Marques says that the restructuring did not negatively affect the productivity of workers. On the contrary, employees were really motivated to support the family and Ms Weber. </p>\r\n<p>Personally, Mr Marques benefited from the restructuring as he developed and acquired new skills and new functions, due to a diversification of tasks which would have not occurred without the restructuring event. This increased his self-confidence. He moreover benefited from the experience of the expert auditors and accountants who advised the company during restructuring.  Mr Marques believes that all employees were treated fairly during the process. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Ms Weber has no particular lessons to draw from the restructuring. She felt she did what she thought was appropriate to do, with the support of her close employees. This was confirmed by Mr Marques. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Author </h2>\r\n<p>Cécile Musialski, Philippe &amp; Partners</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<p>The present report is based on interviews with Ms Weber and Mr Marques, as well as on a press article on the circumstances of Mr De Souza’s death. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"~"Luxembourg"~"49 - land transport and transport via pipelines"~"10-49"~"10-49"~NULL~"internal restructuring"~"2012-05-21"
"Polisport Plásticos, Portugal"~"POLISPORT PLÁSTICOS, S.A."~"<p>The restructuring process at Portuguese company Polisport Pl&aacute;sticos was designed primarily to improve the processes and methods of production. The main focus was on developing the skills of employees and technological capabilities, aimed at the involvement of all in the constant innovation process, the sustained decisions and the openness to change, and afterwards in the innovative capability of the firm.</p>"~"<h2>Organisational profile</h2>\r\n<p>Polisport is an international and legally independent company, based in the northern region of Portugal. The company is 100% owned by Polisport SGPS, a holding that is devoted to transforming the industry of plastics for bicycles and motorcycles (NACE 30920) and has a financial capital of &euro;1 million. The group consists of two companies, Polisport and Polinter which operate in the market for bicycle and motor accessories. Both firms are based in the town of Carregosa, in the municipality of Oliveira de Azem&eacute;is, and divided into three production units totalling 19,000 m<sup>2</sup> of covered area, with 160 employees. This case study is about the firm Polisport, with 110 employees in 2012.The company does not have a works council. The main clients are manufacturers of bicycles, motors and motorcycles. The board members include the president of the board of directors (Pedro Ara&uacute;jo), a member of the board of directors (Maria Ara&uacute;jo) and a representative (Avelino Ant&atilde;o). The company structure is divided into the financial, production/operations, commercial, human resources, purchasing, marketing, IT, quality and logistics departments.</p>\r\n<p>From the very beginning, the company grew by setting high goals and raising them every time. The technologies and production processes applied are: injection moulding, simple injection overlapped extrusion, blow moulding and thermoforming (moulding vacuum).</p>\r\n<p>In 1982, Polisport was created in the form of a society under the name Pedro &amp; Paulo Ara&uacute;jo Pl&aacute;sticos, Lda. and started the production of plastic mudguards. After two years, in 1984, they went to the first international exhibition that took place in Cologne, Germany. In that year, Polisport started moving beyond Portugal, exporting to the Spanish market. Until 1985, Polisport devoted itself primarily to the production of plastic components for motorcycles.</p>\r\n<p>With the opening of new markets and Portugal joining the EU, Polisport needed to diversify its product range, initiating the production of components for bicycles. In 1989, Polisport starts its own moulds production.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, Polisport exported to about 50 countries.</p>\r\n<p>In 1998, the company established the application of the Quality Management System according to NP EN ISO 9002.</p>\r\n<p>In 1999, Polisport became a listed company and one year later launched a new set of innovative products and technologies, namely, the DGP technology (Durable Gloss Polypropylene) and the first baby seat for cars. In 2005, the firm decided to create a Research, Technology and Development (RT&amp;D) department. In addition, it also created the Logistics and Marketing departments, to support the investment in new products and innovative production methods.</p>\r\n<p>The RT&amp;D department started to produce innovative outcomes for Polisport that won it the first IMDA Award from the Inmold Decoration Association for Best Injection Mould Part in 2008, in 2009, the company received two IMDA Awards from the Inmold Decoration Association for Best Injection Mould Part and Best IMD Durable Product. Additionally, Polisport was awarded with an Honourable Mention from COTEC, Portugal&lsquo;s national innovation system for companies, for being one of the most innovative Portuguese SMEs.</p>\r\n<p>In 2010, Polisport was recognised as the most innovative Portuguese company by receiving the award of PME Innovation COTEC-BPI and won the Portuguese SME Excellence award. One year after, the company won two IF Design Awards: product design for Guppy bicycle baby seat and material design for Corky bicycle water bottle.</p>\r\n<p>The company has three major own brands &ndash; Driver, Polisport and Premier &ndash; spread over the five continents. Totally focused on the two wheel business, Polisport works for both the bicycle and motorbike industry specialising in plastics.</p>\r\n<p>The main products for the motorbike market are replica plastics for off-road bikes (enduro, motocross and supermoto) but also headlights, hand protectors, body protections and other accessories.</p>\r\n<p>In the bicycle market, Polisport is the leading European producer of baby-seats, setting the standards for the industry. The range of products also includes mudguards, water bottles, helmets and other accessories.</p>\r\n<h2>Background to restructuring event</h2>\r\n<p>The performance of this SME before the restructuring event was characterised by decreasing sales and turnover. In addition, they needed to extend the scope of their R&amp;D activities oriented towards internationalisation.</p>\r\n<p>The main motivation for the restructuring was based on a fall in turnover, which was mainly caused by the use of non-effective production processes, the need to diversify for destination markets to sell their final products and the need to reinforce the internal R&amp;D capacity and improve the quality of the portfolio of goods and services.</p>\r\n<p>The focus on innovation and development has emerged as a strategic priority, with the emergence of new products, new ideas, new materials, new tools and new processes, which have led to an increase in the volume of business.</p>\r\n<p>Before the restructuring process, Polisport had an ineffective production structure characterised by a lack of technologies to be applied to the injection moulding of thermoplastics with multiple colours, which was a demand from established clients in international markets</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring process</h2>\r\n<p>The restructuring process was based on a specific restructuring plan targeted at improving the processes and methods of production. It consisted of two main actions: (i) legal restructuring of the company and (ii) the creation of a research, technology and development department.</p>\r\n<p>The change in the legal form enabled the company to acquire an increased bargaining capacity to restructure the RT&amp;D capacity of the company and improve its capacity to innovate. The company was listed on the national stock exchange which created several challenges in terms of accountability of the society and also public dissemination of indicators of the company&acute;s financial performance. This strengthened the company&acute;s capacity for negotiating with banks, in order to access the needed external finance to promote the international expansion of the company and the reorganisation of corporate R&amp;D activities. Secondly, in 2005 the management team created the department of Research, Technology and Development focusing on innovative activities in terms of R&amp;D.</p>\r\n<p>From 99 employees, Polisport has increased its number of employees to 110 and introduced a series of technological innovations in the production processes, such as injection molding, simple injection overlapped extrusion/blow molding and thermoforming (molding vacuum), the Plastic Decor Plus which allows the decoration of the entire surface of the plastic parts with greater protection and durability, the Inmold Plastic Decals, which enables inmold sticker on the plastic part during injection, the Double Injection, consisting of two different materials used in the same product and the Durable Gloss Polypropylene.</p>\r\n<p>Several changes were introduced at the level of the formal structure of the company, especially at the corporate governance level, by establishing several leaders (some in-house and some new recruitments) for the areas of logistics, production, marketing, sales, human resources, quality, trading and information systems. The company also created several new areas, such as the Research, Technology and Development department, and through this the need for strengthening the logistics and marketing department also increased.</p>\r\n<p>To address this set of R&amp;D challenges (the need to develop a new set of innovative and more effective production processes and technologies) that was part of the restructuring process, the company implemented an open innovation strategy, by fostering R&amp;D cooperation activities with several scientific stakeholders (spin-offs, academies, R&amp;D laboratories, other firms), identified through collaborative arrangements made possible by joint projects and funding opportunities, licensing patents in the field and opening up to international circuits to explore other innovative channels. In order to get the internal collaborators (workers in the RT&amp;D department) involved in the restructuring process, the firm increased the set of innovation activities, especially the continuous training on innovation.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the company invested in the reinforcement of the skills of employees and technological abilities, through specific lifelong learning courses, partnerships with external scientific partners, COTEC Portugal &ndash; the Entrepreneurial Association for Innovation programmes, oriented towards the promotion of a new culture of corporate entrepreneurship that relies on: customer orientation; innovation and creativity; ethics; flexibility and multiple skills.</p>\r\n<p>Polisport created the Human Resources Department in order to manage and support employees strategically. Since then, Polisport has systematised recruitment and selection, and integration and training processes. They also monitor the organisational climate annually using an employee satisfaction survey. These procedures are important instruments to carry out the continuous innovation targeted at the Polisport business expansion. For lesser-qualified employees, Polisport has a policy to motivate and support employees to complete at least education at high school level.</p>\r\n<p>Concerning the restructuring process, Polisport implemented a set of internal procedures/instruments in order to achieve the ultimate goal to expand through innovation. Such procedures focus on the involvement of the employees in the mission and management policy of Polisport, explicitly including elements relating to the promotion of innovation, like the design and production of innovative products, ensuring safety performance, differentiation and leisure.</p>\r\n<p>To accomplish this, the company invests internally and permanently in the skills of employees and technological capabilities fostering an internal culture. Monthly meetings are organised with the responsible management of the departments in order to discuss strategic indicators, including those that pertain to innovation in business, results and monitoring and setting the correct procedures. As a procedure conducted on an annual basis, a survey for all employees enables comments and ranking the different values of the organisation, opening the presentation of new ideas and knowledge and communication management. Polisport has also developed a platform called &lsquo;Network Ideas&rsquo; for the presentation of ideas by employees. The network is implemented through electronic kiosks at sites open to all employees with access to internal and external information, to call for the launching of ideas.</p>\r\n<p>To meet the clients&rsquo; needs and expectations with regard to innovative capabilities, and as a step in the restructuring process, surveys are undertaken annually. The surveys are directed at international clients (95%) and national clients (5%).</p>\r\n<p>With the directorate involved in driving the implementation of the department, the employees directly involved in the unit were informed and also consulted regarding the decision in advance; the rest were informed after the decision was taken. In order to achieve optimal employee involvement on the innovation pathway and open innovation schemes, the company undertakes specific activities, such as the presence of employees at conferences and trade shows and face-to-face contact with suppliers and customers both home and abroad, visits at universities to present their products and innovations and exchange innovative capacities.</p>\r\n<h2>Challenges and constraints of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Company listing took place under difficult and challenging circumstances, since it was necessary to improve management information systems oriented to accountability in order to meet the needs and procedures needed to the restructuration in the firm's legal structure. For instance, in terms of structure of the firm, it was created a financial unit and an IT unit, as well as the figure of a Unique Fiscal and the necessary managers and executives. In addition to this, external finance was required to increase the amount of own finance sources. To accomplish this, the company obtained the necessary liquidity from external funding gathered on banks. The conditions required were quite demanding, nevertheless the value granted through the intangible assets of the company based on R&amp;D activities, and the portfolio of innovation applications in the plastic industry, congregated the necessary conditions for expanding the value of the company and getting the condition of listed company.</p>\r\n<p>For the second restructuring action, the creation of a RTD Department, the main challenges faced were the need for organising training and coaching activities for the involved team in this unit in the areas of the company&rsquo;s innovation priorities, the spur of open innovation schemes in order to promote partnerships for the development of new technologies in the plastics moulding and the adoption of day-to-day RTD practices related to technological surveillance and IP. Additional staff needed to be recruited, and specific training provided, that would meet the objectives of innovation and creativity and pursue the processes to apply for quality control according to the normative NP4557:2007, for the quality management system NP EN ISO 9001:2008. Other constraints that emerge from the previous mentioned challenges were the costs derived from the procedures of application to the quality norms and the time consumed in such activities.</p>\r\n<h2>Restructuring advice and support</h2>\r\n<p>During restructuring the company received financial support from bank loans and public subsidies.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the public funding, Polisport has participated and continues to participate in several national and international R&amp;D cooperation projects. The company established partnerships with domestic and foreign partners to carry out RDI activities, including design, mould making and prototyping, like universities, technological centres or other organisations of Science and Technology (examples of these include the University of Aveiro, the University of Beira Interior, the Institute of Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Management (INEGI), the Centre for Excellence and Innovation in the Automobile Industry (CEIIA), the Innovation Pole Innovation in Polymer Engineering (FCI) and the IMDA, In-mold Decoration Association, an association of companies around the world). These partners were identified and approached by previous established contacts and previous projects with R&amp;D stakeholders, namely projects consultant, suppliers, university contacts among others. Besides R&amp;D contracts, these arrangements were possible due to external funding that subsidized the research activities (seven framework projects, interreg projects and national framework projects).</p>\r\n<p>The company participated in several EU innovation funding initiatives like the REDOMIC project, which aimed to foster innovation and interaction between industries and universities, the Star-NET Technology Transfer which aims to establish a consolidated structure to support SME sector of surface transport, promoting their participation in the transport theme of FP7. The project teams usually embrace employees, suppliers and customers.</p>\r\n<h2>Outcomes of restructuring</h2>\r\n<p>Regarding the set of measures dedicated to restructuring R&amp;D processes inside Polisport and in terms of major outcomes from those, it is important to mention the return on investment (ROI) of RDI activities which was 4 times in 2010. Investments in RDI led to increased sales and reduced operating costs, for example, the technology developed by Polisport, called IPD allows the decoration of plastic parts at the time of injection itself, and finished getting ready for the customer and thus eliminating costs with additional operations.</p>\r\n<p>The results of these activities allowed the acquisition of new customers, for example, KTM, Husqvarna and BMW.</p>\r\n<p>The share of sales of products and services protected by IP rights in the firm's total turnover represented 11% in 2006, 12% in 2007, 26% in 2008 and 30% in 2009. In addition, the value of intangible assets measured in the form of intellectual property was &euro; 2,215,944, in 2010.</p>\r\n<p>The restructuring of R&amp;D inside Polisport brought other restructuration processes, such as the restructuring of internal information systems that have contributed to the reliability, speed and adequacy of information; they migrated from ERP to other softwares like Primavera, M3 and Hibrix. In 2009 began the project KAIZEN, which led to the restructuring and optimization of internal processes. Afterwards, in 2010, the company restructured the department of Conception, Development and Industrialization with the implementation of the figure of the Project Portfolio Manager and the Project Manager. Nowadays, Polisport has the figure of a Bicycle Product Manager and of the Moto Product Manager that coordinate the respective teams.</p>\r\n<p>The guidelines for future action relative to the restructuring process can be summarised by the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Attraction of new international clients located in emergent economies, specially, Brazil, Russia, India, China, Angola and Eastern Europe;</li>\r\n<li>Diversification of the products portfolio, exploring scope economies, that is, by using the same technological installed capacity for producing new sub products, with a focus on new technologies for moulding plastics (for example, applications for the sports industry and child transportation safety);</li>\r\n<li>Promotion of corporate entrepreneurship practices based on in-house creativity contests;</li>\r\n<li>Upgrading of the open innovation circuits, especially with leading international laboratories or research centres linked to the science and technology network;</li>\r\n<li>Development of platforms both for technological surveillance and competitive surveillance, for reinforcing the competitive advantages; and</li>\r\n<li>Promotion of external and internal spin-offs, by using the project development methodology.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The major achievements with the focus on the RTD activities were mainly the decrease in average production costs; the solving quality and function patterns of the products (solving substitutions problems derived from complex and extra labelling); the improved resistance and products&rsquo; durability; the use of environmental friendly technologies; and the increase in products&rsquo; usability.</p>\r\n<p>To achieve the above mentioned outcomes, Polisport motivates and involves the employees in the restructuring planning and the restructuring processes directly. To do so, employees, at the end of each year, are involved along with the top management of the company, in a meeting where the company strategic goals for the next year are presented focusing on aspects (indicators, achievements, market, etc.) of last year. Besides this, top management also encourages and actively participates in regular meetings with the employees where the ideas launched in Ideas Network meetings and projects by industry product are analysed and discussed.</p>\r\n<p>As an additional outcome of the restructuring process there is, also, a systematic policy of selection and allocation of financial and human resources for projects and innovation activities, as the company integrated innovation as mandatory into the strategy of the same, after the creation of the director and department.</p>\r\n<p>As part of the project called &lsquo;Policompete&rsquo; implemented by the company, it developed the integration of management competencies, job descriptions, responsibilities matrix and performance assessment, denoting direct effects on employees' management. Also, this brought direct effects on staff, as mentioned previously the sense of involvement with the firm's policies and mission and the career policies and progress, based on achievements. In addition, the restructuring made possible the implementation of a policy of selection and recruitment targeted at adjusting each employee to specific projects or innovation activities.</p>\r\n<p>In this sense, Polisport launches new products every year, develops new technologies and partnerships. As direct result from this, Polisport registered six national patents and one European patent Surveys are conducted annually to employees, which include aspects to consider in setting strategy. The analysis of the surrounding conditions and skills of the company has inputs from various departments, leading to the definition of strategic objectives for the organisation.</p>\r\n<p>The organisation developed a plan framed in innovation strategy, formulated, documented and communicated as &lsquo;RDI Policy&rsquo; for that the company invests internally in the skills of the employees and the technological capabilities fostering an internal culture that values customer orientation, innovation and creativity, ethics, flexibility and versatility.</p>\r\n<p>The objectives are translated into specific projects with the corresponding budget allocation, timing of RDI projects and definition of chronological milestones (milestones) to obtain partial results. The objectives of innovation incorporate a research study, sometimes developed in partnership, resulting in a project, focused on technology trends, market needs and capital gains in order to achieve different products and markets. Human resources are, then, allocated by the scope of each project and taking into account their skills.</p>\r\n<p>Every year, a training plan is prepared in accordance with the objectives and gaps observed between current and ideal skills for a particular function: such competencies can include skills related to innovation and can thus direct the training to correct these shortcomings and improve performance. Employees receive regular training in areas relevant to innovation, including innovation management, project management, RD&amp;I strategy, creativity (for example, TRIZ and Innovation Game, a tool that aims at stimulating creativity, sharing ideas and building an action plan for opportunities that are presented to the company), entrepreneurship, leadership, cooperation and conflict management.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, the major outcomes of the process were characterised by the increase in the number of partnerships with R&amp;D partners (for example, universities and spin-offs), in the IP portfolio (for instance, patents and trademarks), in total sales and turnover, in the market share in international markets and direct and indirect effects for employees, namely a human resources policy targeted at career progress by achievements, staff numbers increased from 99 to 110, targeted and specific training applied to the goals of the employee and department .</p>\r\n<p>After starting the restructuring process, the Polisport has received several awards and public recognitions regarding innovative technologies and production processes, such as the first IMDA Award from the Inmold Decoration Association for Best Injection Mold Part (2008), two IMDA Awards from the Inmold Decoration Association for Best Injection Mold Part and Best IMD Durable Product and an honourable mention from COTEC, for being one of the most innovative Portuguese SME (2009), the recognition for being the most innovative Portuguese company of Portugal by getting the PME Innovation COTEC-BPI award and the Portuguese SME Excellence award (2010) and two design awards: Product Design for Guppy bicycle baby seat and Material Design for Corky bicycle water bottle (2011).</p>\r\n<p>The company implemented also international standardised norms for Quality and Innovation: NP EN ISO 9001:2008 and NP4457:2007.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>The main focus of the restructuring processes was on developing the skills of employees and technological capabilities, aimed at the involvement of all in the policies of constant innovation, the sustained decisions and the openness to change, and afterwards the innovative capability of the firm. Polisport's strategy regarding the restructuring process was based on a value proposition, that is, innovation and development. The value proposition considers that the sale of innovative products (products with higher margins) contribute to increasing the productivity of sales and product leadership.</p>\r\n<p>In turn, the hallmarks associated to boost the innovation Polisport brand awareness, which involves attracting new customers and thus increase sales. The innovation trajectory developed by Polisport that is based on open innovations schemes, needs firstly to spur internal collaborators innovation environment in order to promote creativity and develop new products and new technologies, under the scope of the application of the corporate entrepreneurship concept. Polisport should proceed with a focus on innovation, by releasing continuously new products, new technologies, marketing campaigns, and quality certification. To accomplish this, it needs to continuously search for new partnerships with clients and suppliers and promote the coaching of human resources through the development of their core competences and creativity and innovation skills.</p>\r\n<h2>Author</h2>\r\n<p>Dina Pereira, UBI</p>\r\n<p>Jo&atilde;o Leit&atilde;o, UBI, IPP and CEG-IST</p>\r\n<h2>Information sources</h2>\r\n<h3>Interviews</h3>\r\n<p>Pedro Ara&uacute;jo, CEO of Polisport</p>\r\n<p>In&ecirc;s Brand&atilde;o, Director of Human Resources of Polisport Group</p>\r\n<p>Inova Mais (Partner consultant of Polisport)</p>\r\n<h3>Company address</h3>\r\n<p>Polisport Pl&aacute;sticos</p>\r\n<p>Av.
