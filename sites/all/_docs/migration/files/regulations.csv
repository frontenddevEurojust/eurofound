"Arbeitsmarktservicegesetz (AMSG)"~"Public Employment Service Act"~"<p>Short-time working in Austria refers to the temporary reduction of working hours based on a social partner agreement. Workers receive short-time working support (<em>Kurzarbeitsunterst&uuml;tzung</em>) from their employer for the non-worked hours in order to bring their income closer to their normal wage level. In order to do so, the employer receives a short-time working subsidy (<em>Kurzarbeitsbeihilfe</em>) from the Public Employment Service (AMS). Working hours under the short-time working arrangements were made more flexible during the recession, in that they may now range from at least 10% to a maximum of 90% of normal working hours. In 2009, the eligibility period was (temporarily) extended to a maximum of 24 months until the end of 2013. This was extended to the end of 2015 for all cases having been granted before 2012.</p>\r\n<p>The short-time working subsidy amounts to the level of unemployment benefits (including social security contributions) for the non-worked hours (about 55% of the net wage); in this way, lump sums per non-worked hours are determined. This lump sum is based on the normal (legal or collectively agreed) working time, the worker&rsquo;s monthly gross wage (including pro rata holiday and Christmas remuneration) and the number of children the worker has to care for. Furthermore, short-time working subsidy is provided for a monthly gross wage of up to &euro; 4,074.46 (for 2014) - those on higher wages only receive a subsidy for the salary of &euro; 4,074.46 (for 2014). Increased rates are provided if training is conducted while employees are not working.</p>\r\n<p>The employer must pay the employees concerned the total of their normal wage for the hours they do work, along with the short-time working support for the non-worked hours. On a monthly basis, they must also report to the AMS regarding the number of non-worked hours per short-time worker, the amounts paid to the short-time workers as short-time working support. They must also confirm that no short-time workers have been dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>The social security contributions (and benefits) paid during short-time working are based on the previous full-time wage before short-time working commenced. Periods of short-time working are considered as normal/full-time working time regarding qualification periods for unemployment benefits. Furthermore, if unemployment occurs immediately after short-time working, unemployment benefits are calculated on the basis of the previous full-time wage (rather than the reduced income during short-time working). In most cases, however, the social partner agreement states that companies must not make employees redundant for a stated period following short-time working; this ranges from one to four months. Companies must apply for short-time working support six weeks before they initiate the measure (or four weeks before extending it). They must also take part in a consultancy session (involving the works council) with the aim of identifying potential alternatives to short-time working.</p>\r\n<p>Coverage relates to economic difficulties, that is for companies with a drop in production/supplies or sales/demand and to short-time working caused by natural catastrophes, such as avalanches or floods, but also other disasters (such as the aftermath of 9/11). The company must not be affected by economic difficulties due to seasonal variations. Difficulties must be temporary.</p>\r\n<p>Before introducing short-time working, other options need to be used, such as the reduction of overtime, vacation entitlements and working time accounts. A social partner agreement must be established for each company. This must address the terms and conditions of the short-time working arrangement, more specifically, the section of the company that has been affected, the duration of the short-time working, the maintenance of the number of employees, the extent of short-time working payments, the level of decreased working time, and educational measures (if applicable).</p>\r\n<p>All employers are eligible except those in the public sector and political parties. Temporary work agencies can only avail of this support if they can prove that workers sent to specific companies cannot be redeployed in other companies and that the company in which the workers have been employed has registered its core staff for short-time working with the Public Employment Service (<a href=""http://www.ams.at/"">AMS</a>) In such cases, additional requirements have to be met (for example, special agreements among social partners).</p>\r\n<p>All workers are eligible except for CEOs, board members, apprentices, and employees who work such a low number of hours that they are not obliged to make social security contributions (marginal employees (geringf&uuml;gig Besch&auml;ftigte)).</p>"~"<p>37b</p>"~"<p>In 2013, public support was applied to over 4,000 workers (35% females), resulting in public subsidies of over &euro; 7.8 million (Sozialministerium, 2014).</p>\r\n<p>The combination of subsidies with training increased the attractiveness of the scheme. It is a cheaper option for the state than unemployment. The employer avoids 'firing-and-rehiring' costs and is given some time to develop strategic considerations. The wage decrease is lower than the proportion of working hours lost. Moreover, employees avoid unemployment and they also maintain their social security level. The scheme is very targeted, it is available to many employees. It also represents a comparatively fast response to crisis situations.</p>\r\n<p>The Austrian Federal Economic Chamber (<a href=""http://www.wko.at/"">WKO</a>) notes that short-time working is mostly applied for by production companies. It also concludes that both service companies and smaller enterprises find it difficult to access it, due to the complex preconditions and administrative burden involved. Issues are also present in terms of its administration and calculation of pay; the latter requires a software programme as soon as a certain number of employees are affected. The necessity of involving different stakeholders can also pose a barrier for some companies. Not all associated costs, for employers and employees, are covered by the subsidies; dismissal protection can be a significant burden for the employers. Finally, it can be difficult to arrange training during short-time working as meaningful training might not be available during the short-time working period and employees might prefer leisure time to training.</p>"~"<p><a href=""http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Dokumentnummer=NOR40144577&amp;ResultFunctionToken=1ceb399e-1cd6-4916-abea-552121c86f9c&amp;Position=1&amp;Kundmachungsorgan=&amp;Index=&amp;Titel=amsg&amp;Gesetzesnummer=&amp;VonArtikel=&amp;BisArtikel=&amp;VonParagraf=37b&amp;BisParagraf=&amp;VonAnlage=&amp;BisAnlage=&amp;Typ=&amp;Kundmachungsnummer=&amp;Unterzeichnungsdatum=&amp;FassungVom=06.11.2013&amp;NormabschnittnummerKombination=Und&amp;ImRisSeit=Undefined&amp;ResultPageSize=100&amp;Suchworte="">Arbeitsmarktservicegesetz &sect; 37b</a></p>"~"<p><a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/supportinstruments/instruments/view/25/austria_short_time_working_support"">ERM database on restructuring support instruments</a></p>\r\n<p>DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities/H&eacute;ra, <em>Selected companies&rsquo; legal obligations regarding restructuring</em>, 2011</p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0947.htm"">Eurofound, <em>Tackling the recession: Employment-related public initiatives in the EU Member States and Norway</em>.

Companies which employ at least 20 workers are obliged to set up a special reemployment unit or, in certain conditions, to contribute to a special reemployment unit or a regional special reemployment unit of a &lsquo;reconversion cell&rsquo; type, so-called &lsquo;outplacement unit&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The outplacement is a set of services and advice provided on behalf of the employer for the benefit of the worker to help him to find as quickly as possible a new job with another employer or to become self-employed. These services are provided by an outplacement office. Nevertheless, this is compulsory for companies which have more than 20 workers and which proceed to collective dismissals. Moreover, the employer is committed to paying a reclassification allowance, for a period of three months for workers aged under 45 years or six months for those aged over 45 years. For workers aged 45 or older, additional mandatory regulations are in place. For instance, beyond the mandatory severance pay, the social plan agreed should include measures such as early retirement plans, supplements to social security benefits, job security for those employees who remain in service and outplacement services. All workers have access to accompanying advice, guidance and training measures that take account of their skills and experience and the jobs they could potentially do. The measures include organising job interviews with potential new employees, preparation for the interviews and training to extend or update skills.</p>\r\n<p>Employment units are central to the management of restructuring. This concept of active management, established by the Generation Pact, reflects the need to better manage restructuring by helping laid off workers to remain on the job market. In this context, the establishment of employment units tends to spread and be accessible to the greatest number of redundancies as part of restructuring of a company employing more than 20 workers.</p>\r\n<p>The royal decree of 9March 2006 considers the assimilation of conversion measures and the return to work that are organised at regional level and of the German Community to an employment unit. Specific provisions arising from this decree are therefore applicable in the different regions.

Average insolvency benefits reach as high as &euro; 1,708. A survey from 2007 indicated that higher redundancy benefits increase the probability to remain in unemployment (receiving unemployment benefit). This confirms the results from an earlier research which indicated that receiving redundancy benefits reduced the probability to exit unemployment compared to those who did not receive redundancy benefits. Thus, high redundancy benefits reduce motivation to return to work after losing a job and people remain longer in unemployment.</p>\r\n<p>According to research with respect to working conditions included in collective agreements from 2004, 39% of all collective agreements analysed include provisions on redundancy benefits or remuneration upon termination of employment contracts. 26% include provisions on advance notice periods and 20% on those categories of workers who have preferential rights to keep their jobs. The research analysed collective agreements registered with the Ministry of Social Affairs including a total of 66 collective agreements (Kallaste, E.

Apprentices and people under training contracts do not benefit from the individual right to training. The rights acquired annually can be capitalised over a maximum period of 6 years, which represents 120 hours of training. The employee has to ask for implementing his individual right to training and the employer has one month to agree to the training action. If the employer disagrees, the employee can only reiterate its request later.</p>\r\n<p>Following Law n&deg;2013-504 on job security and in order to facilitate access to lifelong training, any person above the age of 16 in employment or seeking employment will be granted an individual training account. This scheme will be implemented as from 1 January 2015. From then on, the individual training account will replace the DIF scheme and this account is intended to accompany the worker through his whole career, even if he changes employment or experiences unemployment (whereas before, the DIF was attached to the employment contract, not the worker). Law n&deg;2014-288 on professional training, employment and social democracy establishes that this account is credited each year, by 150 hours maximum over 7 years. Beyond, additional subscriptions may be made by the employer, the worker, the public employment agency or regional councils.</p>"~"<p>L2242-15, L2242-16, L6313-10,&nbsp;L6321-1, L6323-1 Labour Code</p>"~"<p>Use of <strong>GPEC</strong> was moderate up until 2008. As of 31 December 2008, 570 GPEC agreements were signed, concerning approximately 1,475,000 workers; 41% of these firms have between 300 and 1,000 workers, and a further 36% are firms with more than 1,000 workers.</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, 903 GPEC agreements were signed. However, this rise can be explained by the fact that Law n&deg;2005-32 stated that companies employing more than 300 employees must have opened negotiations on GPEC in January 2008 latest. As many companies opened negotiations late, this explains the peak in agreements deposit in 2008 and 2009.</p>\r\n<p>In 2010, the number of GPEC agreements decreased to 557 and a study published in 2012 based on 12 case study showed that the current trend is on the decline.</p>\r\n<p>GPEC is used as a tool to anticipate labour market changes, mainly those caused by economical and technological changes. It focuses on adapting workers' skills, and aims to avoid massive restructurings. It presents a good way of addressing both competitiveness for the company and the management of employees&rsquo; career. It involves selecting the best tools required to implement change and enables staff to acquire a deep insight into the reasons behind expected changes. In doing so, it enables them to become real actors in the development of their career and their employability. This model takes a 'voluntarist' approach to social dialogue and information sharing. It involves commitment and support from all stakeholders. Teritorial HR planning (GPEC territoriale) assesses labour market changes at a regional level, which allows a more strategic approach. The geographic region is the cornerstone of the territorial GPEC; this is relevant to the extent that the territory and its characteristics (workforce, infrastructures and enterprises) comprise a key factor in the attractiveness of new enterprises. The territory is also the main issue in terms of mobility of the workforce; for this reason, territories are often characterised by the availability of specific skills. Territorial GPEC allows a concerted social dialogue at regional level; this is more valuable than the HR planning of one company.</p>\r\n<p>Differing views may be held by management and the trade unions regarding information that should be shared; issues here relate to strategy, confidentiality, foresight and dialogue. There is a need to take time to develop tools for mapping, operational forward planning, and other shared tools where necessary. A challenge also is to mobilise management.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>DIF</strong> is accessible to a large proportion of employees. It is the first training scheme ever used by employees.</p>\r\n<p>However, the French government has decided to reform the DIF scheme because its efficiency is unproven. In 2011, only 4.9% of workers used the DIF.</p>\r\n<p>DIF is used by small and medium enterprises, which are generally least likely to resort to training. According to some collective agreements at branch level, training can take place during the working time. This acts as an incentive for workers to make use of this training opportunity.</p>\r\n<p>Some are sceptical regarding the multiple training options and the complexity of the training schemes. This has also led to the creation of multiple training schemes of poor quality and criticisms were addressed that there is no sufficient control over the content and execution of training schemes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The DIF also lacks to contribute to qualified trainings. Besides, as the DIF is attached to the employment contract and not to the individual, the hours accumulated are lost from one job to another, when in fact training is very important for people looking for a new job. Law n&deg;2009-1437 introduced portability of these rights but in practice it is not used very often because it is up to the worker to ask for it (66,000 workers asked for it in 2012).</p>"~"<p><a href=""http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000806166&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id%20"">Law n&deg;2005-32 on social cohesion</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000027546648&amp;fastPos=1&amp;fastReqId=1931215064&amp;categorieLien=cid&amp;oldAction=rechTexte"">Law n&deg;2013-504 on job security</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000021341228&amp;idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006189881&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072050&amp;dateTexte=20110510"">Article L6321-1 Labour code</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=8C29C86411D33703371388901E7AB8D1.tpdjo15v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000027565875&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072050&amp;dateTexte=20140729"">Articles L.2242-15 and following Labour Code</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.emploi.gouv.fr/dispositif/gestion-previsionnelle-l&rsquo;emploi-et-des-competences-gpec"">Government website on GPEC</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/le-droit-individuel-a-la-formation,1071.html#sommaire_1"">Government website on DIF&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/DP_loi_Formation_professionnelle_emploi_democratie_sociale_6mars2014.pdf"">Report from the government dedicated to the new law n&deg;2014-288 on professional training, employment and social democracy</a></p>"~"<p>DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities/H&eacute;ra, Selected companies&rsquo; legal obligations regarding restructuring, 2011</p>\r\n<p>Triomphe, C.E., Teissier, C., Goryacheva, A.

In any case, their remuneration can not go below the statutory minimum wage. Workers placed under the partial activity scheme can benefit from trainings. In this case, the compensation is increased to 100% of of the net hourly wage.</p>\r\n<p>The employer receives an allowance jointly from the state and the unemployment insurance body. For a company employing fewer than 250 workers, the employer receives &euro;7.74 per hour per worker. For a company with more than 250 workers, the employer receives &euro;7.23 per hour per worker.</p>\r\n<p>During partial activity, the employment contract between the employee and the employer is only suspended. Therefore, the employee is still linked to his employer by the initial employment contract.</p>\r\n<p>Before placing its employees under partial activity, the company must ask the labour inspectorate for authorisation. The labour inspectorate has 15 days to answer. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Partial activity is allowed for a maximum period of 6 months, renewable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Agreement to 'maintain employment'</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Articles L5125-1 to L5125-7 of the Labour code </span></span></span>introduce a new category of collective agreements: the agreement 'to maintain employment'.

In 2010, it reached its lowest level since the beginning of the crisis, but in 2012 it started increasing again. In 2012, slightly more than 21 million hours of partial activity were used. Each month, on average, more than 56,000 workers were placed under partial activity with an average 32 hours reduction in their monthly working time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Research carried out on over 36,000 French companies (with at least 50 employees) using partial activity between 1996 and 2004 has shown that participation in the scheme does not reduce layoffs as a consequence of short-term economic downturns. This is&nbsp;especially so in cases of long duration of partial activity (Calavrezo et al, 2009). In addition, the uptake of partial activity tends to be an early indicator of dismissal that will follow. These results do not necessarily suggest that partial activity is an inefficient job security policy instrument. It may be the case that short-time working and layoffs play a complementary role to&nbsp;each other in addressing temporary economic difficulties.</p>\r\n<p>Employees&rsquo; entitlements to unemployment benefits and future pension are not negatively affected in situations where they have been placed under the partial activity scheme. A good level of consensus between the social partners has facilitated the implementation of urgent measures in response to the global recession. Finally, the scheme provides affected employees with the right to training days provided by different employers.</p>\r\n<p>Following Law n&deg;2013-504 of June 2013 on job security, the partial unemployment scheme has been reformed (and renamed into partial activity).

The employer has to consult on the suggestions of the works council.</p>\r\n<p>The consultation should aim at a voluntary reconciliation-of-interest agreement (Interessenausgleich) defining whether, when and at which terms the restructuring shall be implemented.

The settling of a reconciliation-of-interest agreement is voluntary and cannot be enforced by the works council.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast, the employer and the works council are obliged to settle a social compensation plan (Sozialplan) if the restructuring entails disadvantages (dismissals, transfer to new position) for employees. The social compensation plan should compensate for financial prejudicies and consider support schemes aimed at avoiding unemployment provided for in Book Three of the Social Code. The Social Code stipulates financial support by the Federal Employment Agency to set up training and job transfer measures. The coverage of the social compensation plan is not specified. In practice, the plan typically covers standard full-time and part-time workers and excludes workers on fixed-term contracts, marginal part-time workers, trainees and managerial staff.&nbsp;Establishments in place for less than four years do not have to conclude and finance&nbsp;a social compansation plan.</p>\r\n<p>In case of dispute regarding the voluntary reconciliation-of-interest agreement, management or works council may apply to the Executive Board of the Federal Employment Agency for arbitration.</p>\r\n<p>In case of dispute with regard to the social compansation plan, the conciliation commitee (established by the Federal Employment Agency) shall make a decision&nbsp;on the social compensation plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"~"<p>111-113</p>"~"<p>According to D&auml;ubler et al.

The legislation requires employers to inform the workers concerned in writing. In the written information, the employer has to indicate the reasons explaining the redundancies, and the motives excluding the adoption of alternative measures capable of avoiding or reducing the dismissals. Moreover, the employer must communicate the names and addresses of the redundant workers, as well as their jobs, skill level, job classification level, age, family components, the time table for the redundancy plans and the criteria for their selection, the measures to address the consequences of the redundancies and the method of calculating the various types of remuneration to the trade unions which had received notification of the start of the &lsquo;mobility procedure&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although the law encourages the parties to seek an agreement on ways of reabsorbing redundant personnel, it also leaves the employer free to reject the trade unions&rsquo; proposals. Likewise, the unions are free not to ask for a joint examination of the enterprise&rsquo;s crisis situation, nor to reach any form of agreement with the employer. The legislation specifies a maximum consultation period of 45 days (with a possible further 30 days' consultation with the regional or provincial authority). The consultation period can be extended 30 more days if employers and employees fail to reach agreement within 45 days. However, if the parties do not reach agreement on the mobility procedure, and if payment of the mobility allowance is stipulated, the cost to the enterprise is considerably greater.

However, it may do this at an earlier stage.</p>\r\n<p>It is also possible for the social partners, at the appropriate level, to take a common initiative. If they believe the company faces economic or financial problems with a potential negative impact on employment they can enter into negotiations, though there is no obligation to conclude them.

"Code du travail"~"Labour Code"~"<p>If a company with at least 15 employees announces five dismissals for economic reasons during a period of three months or eight dismissals in six months, the Tripartite Economic Committee (consisting of representatives of the Government, employers and trade unions) has to invite the social partners, at the appropriate level, to start a bargaining process to set up a job retention plan (<em>plan de maintien dans l'emploi</em>), which may receive state funding. However, it may do this at an earlier stage.</p>\r\n<p>It is also possible for the social partners, at the appropriate level, to take a common initiative - if they believe the company faces economic or financial problems with a potential negative impact on employment they can enter into negotiations, though &nbsp;there is no obligation to conclude them. Moreover, the Tripartite Economic Committee may analyse the economic, financial and social situation of the company, with the help of external experts, if necessary.</p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;Social partners at the appropriate level&rsquo; in this case means the employer or an employers' association, staff representatives, representatives of employees of the joint works council, trade unions that signed the collective agreement applicable to the company, trade-unions of &lsquo;national general representativeness&rsquo;, and trade unions &lsquo;representative in a particular important sector of economy&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>The job retention plan must contain the results of the negotiations between the social partners. The job retention plan must be signed by social partners at the appropriate level and sent to the Tripartite Economic Committee for approval by the Ministry for Economy.</p>\r\n<p>The Tripartite Economic Committee will monitor the implementation of the plan. If the social partners do not succeed in establishing a job retention plan, they must establish a report on the content and the conclusions of the discussions. This report must be signed by the parties and sent to the president of the Tripartite Economic Committee.</p>\r\n<p>In cases of dismissal of at least seven employees within 30 days or at least 15 employees in 90 days, a social plan containing redundancy schemes for dismissed employees has to be prepared and negotiated. Redundancy schemes often include measures that will assist the redundant workers. Among the most commonly implemented are the creation of a reclassification cell which has a role of assessment, guidance and advice to the employee on his or her professional and personal situation and expectations; bonus incentives for voluntary redundancies; retraining agreements; aid for geographic mobility; aid for business set-ups; and specific measures for older employees or for employees whose social characteristics or qualifications make their return to work particularly hard.</p>"~"<p>L. 161-4; L. 161-6; L.166-1ff; L. 513-1 to L. 513-4</p>"~""~"<p><a href=""http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/textescoordonnes/codes/code_travail/Code_du_Travail.pdf"">Labour code</a>&nbsp;</p>"~"<p>DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities/H&eacute;ra, 2011, Selected companies&rsquo; legal obligations regarding restructuring</p>\r\n<p>Ius Laboris, 2009, Collective Redundancies Guide, Brussels</p>\r\n<p>Thomas, A., 2010, National background paper Luxembourg, Anticipating and managing restructuring in enterprises: 27 national seminars, ARENAS Report.

For example, the parties can negotiate measures such as the use of outplacement companies, training, or professional recycling for the improvement of the workers employability, or other measures to make the undertaking viable.&nbsp;Consultation has to take place with a single negotiating committee. If there are several job centres, the negotiating committee will be limited to the job centres affected by the collective dismissal. The negotiating committee will be made up by a maximum of 13 workers.</p>\r\n<p>The negotiating committee has to be constituted prior that the company communicates the opening of the consultation process. Accordingly, the company has to communicate to the employees or their representatives its intention of implementing a collective dismissal. The negotiating committee has to be constituted within 7 days since the date that the company communicates its intention of implementing a collective dismissal. In the job centres where there are not employees&rsquo; representatives the period for constituting the negotiating committee will be extended to 15 days.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After this period, the company will be able to formally communicate the beginning of the consultation process.

This was made in order to reduce legal uncertainty regarding collective dismissal procedures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After the 2012 reform, an important share of concluded proceeding about collective dismissals resulted in court ruling against employers.

In February 2012, a labour legislation reform eliminated the requirement for administrative authorisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Collective dismissal has to affect at least 10 employees in companies smaller than 100 employees; 10% of the employees in companies between 100 and 300 employees; and 30 employees in companies bigger than 299 employees. In addition, the company can implement a collective dismissal if it affects a minimum of more than five employees if the entire workforce is affected.</p>\r\n<p>The employers must supply the labour authorities the following information: a statement for the reasons for redundancies, individual personal and job information on candidates for redundancy; the names of all other employees; financial statements such as balance sheets, with a separate report on the finances, production, sales and organisation; an auditor's assessment and a report by the works council or personnel delegates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once the information has been provided, a consultation period is opened which will be no longer than 30 days, or 15 in case of companies of fewer than 50 workers. During this period, employers and workers&rsquo; representatives discuss the reasons motivating the process and the possibility of avoiding or reducing its effects, as well as the necessary measures to attenuate its consequences for workers. For example, the parties can negotiate measures such as the use of outplacement companies, training, or professional recycling for the improvement of the workers employability, or other measures to make the undertaking viable.&nbsp;Consultation has to take place with a single negotiating committee. If there are several job centres, the negotiating committee will be limited to the job centres affected by the collective dismissal. The negotiating committee will be made up by a maximum of 13 workers. The negotiating committee has to be constituted prior that the company communicates the opening of the consultation process.</p>\r\n<p>During the consultation period, the labour authority will monitor its effectiveness. In addition, it can make non bindings recommendations. The labour authority has to communicate the collective dismissal to the Public Employment Service and ask to the labour inspector to submit a report about the development of the consultation process. The report must be submitted 15 days after the communication by the employer of the end of the consultation period.</p>\r\n<p>If there is an agreement between the employer and the employees' representatives, the collective dismissal will be applied. If there is no ar'eement, the employer has the final decision. Thus, it will communicate the labour authority and the employee&rsquo;s representatives its final decision and the conditions which will be applied.</p>"~"<p>Art. 51 Statute of Workers&rsquo; Rights; Art. 2 and 30 Royal Decree 801/2011; Art. 18.3 Law 3/2012; Art. 4&nbsp;&nbsp;Royal-Decree 11/2013</p>"~""~"<p><a href=""https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1995-7730"">Statute of Workers&rsquo; Rights</a></p>\r\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2011/06/14/pdfs/BOE-A-2011-10286.pdf"">RD 801/2011</a></span></p>\r\n<p><a href=""https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2012/07/07/pdfs/BOE-A-2012-9110.pdf"">Law 3/2012</a></p>\r\n<p><a title=""Royal-Decree 11/2013"" href=""http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2013/08/03/pdfs/BOE-A-2013-8556.pdf"">Royal-Decree 11/2013</a></p>"~"<p>DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities/H&eacute;ra, 2011, Selected companies&rsquo; legal obligations regarding restructuring</p>\r\n<p>Ius Laboris, 2009, Collective Redundancies Guide, Brussels</p>\r\n<p>Watson Wyatt, 2006, Employment Terms &amp; Conditions Report Europe, Volume I, Brussels, Belgium</p>\r\n<p>Alpha Consulting, 2003, Anticipating &amp; Managing Change - A dynamic approach to the social aspects of corporate restructuring, Brussels, European Commission</p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/erm_car/tn0608036s.htm"">EMCC legal framework of restructuring</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.empleo.gob.es/es/Guia/"">Labour Guide.

Otherwise they must consult with &lsquo;appropriate representatives&rsquo; of the workforce. Often, in practice, these 'appropriate representatives' can include works councils set up under statutory information and consultation arrangements.</p>\r\n<p>Prior consultation depends largely on the size of firm and on whether an information and consultation agreement exists (information and consultation regulations apply to firms with 100+, and 50+ employees from 2008), which obliges employers to provide information on probable developments in employment and work organisation. This applies to all employees and employers except for those employed on fixed terms of three months or less.</p>\r\n<p>Employers must consult with affected workers&rsquo; representatives in three key areas. These are consultation about ways of avoiding the dismissals, reducing the numbers to be dismissed and mitigating the consequences of the dismissals. These areas include consultation&nbsp;over the reasons for the dismissals, numbers affected, proposed method of selecting redundant employees, proposed method of carrying out the dismissals including the period over which they should take effect, and the proposed method of calculating the amount of any redundancy.</p>\r\n<p>If there are no representatives then workers select one. If none are forthcoming then the employer simply provides information direct to employees.</p>\r\n<p>The consultation period depends on the number of workers being dismissed. Fewer than 20, &nbsp;only individual consultation; more than 20 is a collective redundancy situation.</p>\r\n<p>Individuals are entitled to their contractual notice period, usually based on tenure and age. There are minimum notice periods set out in S.86 of the Employment Rights Act (1996). It requires that the employer listens to the views of the employee representatives but does not have to take them into account. In line with the regulations for redundancy employers only have to consult. If they are inclined they can go further but the law only obliges them to consult with the employee representatives 'in good time' (that is, at least 90 days if 100+ dismissals, otherwise 30 days).</p>\r\n<p>The minimum period of consultation can be extended, as long as redundancy notices have not been issued.</p>\r\n<p>If consultation is not completed after the period foreseen by law, the consultation must be completed.</p>\r\n<p>There must be adequate or sufficient information so as to make the consultation process &lsquo;meaningful&rsquo;. The information must include: the reasons for the proposals; the numbers and descriptions of employees it is proposed to dismiss as redundant; the total number of employees of any such description employed by the employer at the establishment in question; the proposed method of selecting the employees who may be dismissed; the proposed method of carrying out the dismissals, taking account of any agreed procedure, including the period over which the dismissals are to take effect; the proposed method of calculating any redundancy payments, other than those required by statute, that the employer proposes to make.</p>"~"<p>Part IV Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992</p>"~"<p>Many collective agreements include provision for more consultancy for all redundancies. &nbsp;Collective agreements are rarely enforceable in law &ndash; only if they are specifically incorporated into workers&rsquo; contracts of employment.</p>\r\n<p>Section 188 of <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/contents"">Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992</a>&nbsp;was ammended by <a href=""http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKEAT/2013/0547_12_3005.html"">USDAW V Ethel Austin Ltd </a>to remove the words 'in one establishment'.&nbsp; This means&nbsp;employers proposing to make more than 20&nbsp;redundancies within 90 days must consult with staff irrespective of the number of staff at the individual site.

No contributions must be paid for the first month, however. The fund has to be selected in due time on the basis of a company agreeement, that is between the employer and the works council. If there is no works council in the company, the employer has to select a fund and inform all staff members in written within one week. If at least one third of the employees reject the chosen fund within two weeks, the employer has to suggest an alternative. On demand of the workers, an employees' organisation has to be consulted. If still no agreement can be established within two weeks after involving the employees' organisation, an arbitration board will decide upon the fund.</p>\r\n<p>Upon termination of the employment contract, the worker is entitled to severance payment towards the fund, unless</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the termination came into effect on demand of the worker;</li>\r\n<li>the termination came into effect by the employer because of wrongful behaviour of the worker;</li>\r\n<li>contributions have been paid into the fund for less than three years.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If the worker wants to draw on the payment, s/he has to inform the fund in writing within six months&nbsp;following the&nbsp;termination of the employment contract. The amount of severance payment&nbsp;is calculated based on&nbsp;the accumulated contributions by the end of the month when the entitlement becomes due.</p>\r\n<p>The worker can also opt for leaving the money in the fund for later use.

After that, they are entitled to one week&rsquo;s notice for each year of service up to a maximum of 12 weeks.

"Betriebsverfassungsgesetz; Kündigungsschutzgesetz"~"Works Constitution Act; Employment Protection Act"~"<p>Under the Employment Protection Act, the employer may dismiss on operational grounds only those employees who cannot be voluntarily transferred to another department or establishment of the same employer even if they receive further training.&nbsp;The following social selection criteria have to be applied:&nbsp;tenure, age, family responsibilities, severe disability. Guidelines for selecting individuals in the framework of individual or collective dismissals (within 30 days, dismissals of at least 6 employees in companies with 21-59 workers, at least 10% (or 26) in companies with 60-499 workers, or at least 30 dismissals in larger firms) require the agreement of the works council. In companies with more than 500 employees, the works council can request that guidelines for social seletcion are set up. If no agreement is reached, a mediation body decides.</p>\r\n<p>When selecting employees for redundancy, a pool of comparable employees must first be identified before specific selection criteria are applied. The employer may in general only dismiss those employees who score the lowest marks when those criteria are applied. The social selection shall exclude employees rated vital to the further existence of the company because of skills, competences or performance.</p>\r\n<p>Under the Works Constitution Act, the works council has to be consulted with regard to the social selection. If the council objects to the decision, the individual worker may file complaint because of unfair dismissal. In case of planned collective dismissals and in case of the negotiation of a social plan, the works council may involve in the social selection. If the social plan gives a list of selected workers, these workers do not hold the right to file a complaint under the Employment Protection Act.</p>"~"<p>Works Constitution 95, 102</p>\r\n<p>Employment Protection Act 1 III-V</p>"~"<p>Generally speaking, the implied social basis of the mechanism tends to protect more vulnerable workers. This can conflict with the aim of regaining economic viability through restructuring, a goal which may be shared by the works council in its endeavour to preserve jobs. This problem is most obvious when downsizing is massive, so that the establishment would be left with mostly vulnerable workers. Negotiations on restructuring are centred on a compromise between social and economic perspectives, and on designing the legal mechanisms by which the agreed outcome can be achieved.</p>"~"<p><a href=""http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/betrvg/__95.html"">Works Constitution Act</a></p>\r\n<p><a title=""K&uuml;ndigungsschutzgesetz"" href=""http://www.bmas.de/DE/Service/Gesetze/Kschg.htm"">Employment Protection Act</a></p>"~"<p>Knuth, M.

To illustrate, suppose&nbsp;there is a dismissal involving 15 employees&nbsp;that followed&nbsp;the usual procedure, i.e. the employer requested for dismissal permit at the public employment service. On top of this, two dismissals through a court procedure were realised&nbsp;and three termination agreements were negotiated between the employer and the employee within a period of three months following the initial dismissals. Then according to the changes from 1 March 2012, this all&nbsp;ads up to 20 and therefore&nbsp;regarded as collective dismissal, i.e. above treshold.</p>"~"<p>Article 3</p>"~"<p>In case five or more employees are to be dismissed by judicial decision in addition to an UWV procedure&nbsp;within a three months period, the Law of collective redundancy applies. In practice this also means that, with intervals of three months, 19 employees can be dismissed without the rules of the Law mentioned being applicable. This amendment to the Collective Redundancy (Notification) Act fills the gap in terms of implementing the directive in Dutch law. The trade unions in particular have been pushing to expand the scope of application because they believe employers often use termination agreements to circumvent the law and, in doing so, marginalise the role of the unions and works councils in relation to collective redundancy as well. It has proven successful to have the economic reasons for planned dismissals audited by experts.

"Työsopimuslaki (55/2001)"~"The Employment Contracts Act (55/2001)"~"<p>According to the Employment Contracts Act of 2001, the term&nbsp;'laying-off' means a temporary (either for a fixed or indefinite period of time) interruption of work. This relates to situations where the work offered to an employee has diminished substantially and permanently, for financial or production-related reasons or for reasons arising from reorganisation of the employer&rsquo;s operations.</p>\r\n<p>The employer is entitled to change the employment relationship unilaterally into a part-time relationship. Remuneration is based on an employer decision or an agreement made on the basis of an employer initiative.</p>\r\n<p>During the period of lay-off, the employee is entitled to unemployment benefit. Temporary lay-off can be either on a full-time basis, or it can involve a&nbsp;reduction in regular working hours. The law does not give a maximum duration during which temporary lay-off is possible.</p>"~"<p>Ch.&nbsp;7,&nbsp;Sec. 11 (part-time work); Ch. 5 (temporary lay-off)</p>"~"<p>The system benefits both employers and employees. It acknowledges the company's need to maintain its professional workers, even during periods in which they cannot provide them with employment. Temporary lay-offs comprise the principle means by which Finnish enterprises have tried to minimise dismissals and to survive the current economic recession. Monthly figures of lay-offs&nbsp;are published in the Employment Bulletins by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy (described as 'fully laid-off' in the Bulletins).</p>\r\n<p>The Federation of Finnish Technology Industries represents one of the most severely affected sectors in terms of temporary layoffs. According to it,&nbsp;the system of temporary layoffs offers an alternative to redundancies in situations where an economic upswing is anticipated. However, enterprises do not know exactly when this might happen.</p>\r\n<p>Trade unions acknowledge the value of this labour market instrument, but they also identify certain difficulties. Depending on the individual situation, trade unions suggest that rather than laying off employees it would be better to keep them and invest in training and further qualification measures. According to the trade unions, good practice examples do exist of companies that have concluded co-determination negotiations with employees and local labour authorities, resulting in the provision of training for temporarily laid off staff. Trade unions also regard a significant number of temporary lay-offs as being economically unjustified; they argue that in some cases,&nbsp;employers dismiss staff temporarily without a genuine need. At the same time, the trade unions highlight&nbsp;the&nbsp;impact&nbsp;of temporary lay-offs on those employees who are not laid&nbsp;off, but continue to work in the&nbsp;company.&nbsp;Often, these workers&nbsp;are responsible for both their own work as&nbsp;well as the duties of those of who have been laid off. This&nbsp;can result in extended working hours without proper compensation.</p>"~"<p><a href=""http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2001/en20010055"">Employment Contracts Act (55/2001)</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2001/20010055"">Ty&ouml;sopimuslaki (55/2001)</a></p>"~"<p>Voss, E., Maack, W.

"Zakon o delovnih razmerjih (ZDR-1)"~"Employment Relationships Act (ZDR-1)"~"<p><strong></strong>The employer shall draw up a proposal for redundancy selection criteria in case of collective dismissals (within 30 days, dismissals of at least 10 employees in companies with 21-99 workers, at least 10% in companies with 100-299 workers and at least 30 dismissals in lager firms). In agreement with the trade union at the employer, the employer may draw up his own redundancy selection criteria instead of using the criteria laid down in the collective agreement. When defining redundancy selection criteria, the following in particular shall be taken into account:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the worker&rsquo;s professional education and/or qualification for work and the necessary additional knowledge and skills,</li>\r\n<li>the worker&rsquo;s work experience,</li>\r\n<li>the worker&rsquo;s job performance,</li>\r\n<li>the worker&rsquo;s years of service,</li>\r\n<li>the worker&rsquo;s health condition,</li>\r\n<li>the worker&rsquo;s social status and</li>\r\n<li>whether the worker is a parent of three or more minor children or the sole breadwinner in a family with minor children.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When determining workers who will become redundant, under the same criteria workers with a worse social status shall be given priority in preserving their employment. Temporary absence from work of a worker due to illness or injury, due to caring for a family member or for a severely disabled person, or due to parental leave or pregnancy may not be a criterion for the determination of redundant workers.</p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>The employer may not dismiss works council members, trade union representatives, board members or other such officials without the consent of the union. Older workers above a certain age may not be dismissed unless they qualify for full pensions or unless they agree to a package that supports them until they reach full pension age.

In all of these cases, a manager is charged HRK 4,000&ndash;6,000 (&euro;532&ndash;&euro;798). An additional fine can also be charged to both the employer and manager in all these cases if these irregularities are spotted during an inspection of the premises.

"Zakon o radu"~"Labour Act"~"<p>If employers plan to make at least five employees redundant on the grounds of severe business conditions (within a group of at least 20 workers to be dismissed on any grounds) within the next 90 days, they are obliged to consult with the works council in order to find alternative solutions (Article 120 of Labour Act). The employer must inform the works council of the reasons for collective redundancies in writing. As well as the reasons for redundancies, the information provided by employers to the works council must include: the number of employees to be let go; their qualifications and job descriptions; criteria for the selection of employees to be made redundant; the expected period in which the selected workplaces will be closed down; the amount of severance pay provided and the way the severance pay is calculated.</p>\r\n<p>Employers must inform the Croatian employment service of the consultations with the works council and disclose to them the same document related to the reasons and criteria of dismissals as is provided to the works council. In addition, the employment service needs to be informed of the duration of consultations with the works council, results of the consultations and written remarks of the works council related to dismissals, if there are any.</p>\r\n<p>An employer who, after consultations with the works council, still intends to make employees redundant must prepare a redundancy programme. When preparing the redundancy programme, the employer needs to address the possibilities of technology or organisational change, employing the workers in other positions, finding them jobs with other employers, part-time work and worker's prequalifications (Article 121 of the Labour Act). According to Article 122 of the Labour Act, the employer planning collective dismissals is obliged to disclose the redundancy programme to the work council and to the governing office of the Croatian employment service. The works council can submit its remarks on the redundancy programme to the governing office of the Croatian employment service and to the employer.</p>"~"<p>120, 121, 122</p>"~"<p>The establishment of a works council is not an obligation but a right given to workers employed in all companies except public administration and institutions with less than 20 employees.&nbsp; The right to establish a works council is given by Article 136 of the Labour Act. Before the amendments of the Labour Act, the Croatian employment service had to address the content of the redundancy programme, while there is no such obligation as of 1 July 2013. In addition, the rules regulating European works council establishment and work apply as of 1 July 2013.</p>\r\n<p><span>In 2012, the Croation Employment Service received 91 Redeployment Programmes involving 5.697 persons, of which 2,245 were women (with a share of 39.4%) and 3,452 men (with a share of 60.6%). As far as the structure of workers covered by redeployment programmes by the level of education is concerned, workers with secondary school education (46.6%) accounted for the largest share, followed by skilled and highly-skilled workers (18.5%), low-skilled workers (13%) and workers with post-secondary education (10.1%). As far as the age structure is concerned, most workers belonged to the following groups: from 55 to 59 years of age (18.5%), from 50 to 54 (16.3%), from 45 to 49 (13.9%), from 40 to 44 (12%), from 35 to 39 (11.7%) and from 30 to 34 years of age (11.4%). Persons covered by redeployment programmes mainly came from manufacturing (55.4%), wholesale and retail trade (11%), construction ( 8.6%), information and communications (8%) and transport and storage (6.5%). Compared to 2011, when the Croation Employment Service received 44 Redeployment Programmes encompassing 3,457 persons, the number of programmes received in 2012 increased by 47, while the number of persons encompassed increased by 4.8%. The number of persons registered as unemployed immediately following the termination of their employment due to economic, technical or organisational reasons was 52,463 in 2012. The figure shows that only a small number of persons registered as unemployed immediately following the termination of their employment due to economic, technical or organisational reasons (10.9%) was covered by redeployment programmes, which is nevertheless a significant increase compared to previous years. While in 2007 and 2008 there were 18 and 31 programmes performed with 1,504 and 2,642 persons covered, in 2010 there were 89 programmes with 5,637 persons covered. The situation improved also in 2013, compared to 2012, when the employment service received 91 Redeployment Programmes encompassing 5,697 persons, the number of programmes received in 2013 increased by 16 (or 17.6%), while the number of persons encompassed by the same increased by 125.4%.</span></p>\r\n<p>The Croatian Employment Service (CESS) actively participates in solving problems linked to large numbers of lay-offs. Already during the counselling activities, the CESS tries to help the redundant employees or those facing the threat of lay-off by providing placement services during the notice period with the aim of securing other employment for them by referring such employees to retraining or other programmes for the purpose of obtaining some other position in the same company or elsewhere.</p>\r\n<p>In the implementation of activities associated with the manner of handling surplus employee situations, the CESS faces a series of problems, primarily the lack of job vacancies both with the employer concerned and other employers, followed by the psycho-physical condition of persons covered by the programmes. The end goal of activities is to help persons facing the threat of lay-off be reemployed as fast as possible, ensuring the return of as many workers as possible to the world of labour and preventing long-term unemployment.</p>"~"<p><a href=""http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2009_12_149_3635.html"">Croatian Official Gazette</a></p>"~"<p><a href=""http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2009_12_149_3635.html"">Labour Act 149/2009</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2011_06_61_1353.html"">Labour Act 61/2011</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2013_06_73_1455.html"">Labour Act 73/2013</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.hzz.hr/UserDocsImages/HZZ_Godisnjak_2013.pdf"">Yearly Report 2013</a></p>\r\n<p>Croatian Employment Service 'Redeployment Programme' (Program zbrinjavanja vi&scaron;ka radnika), available at<a href=""http://www.hzz.hr/UserDocsImages/HZZ_Godisnjak_2013.pdf"">http://www.hzz.hr/UserDocsImages/HZZ_Godisnjak_2013.pdf</a></p>"~"Croatia"~"Anticipation"~"N.A."~"national government*public employment service*works council"~"company size by number of employees#20*number of affected employees#At least 20, of whom at least 5 made redundant on the grounds of severe business conditions."~"staff information and consultation on collective dismissals"

The same applies for the three-month period before the termination of a contract if the contract was terminated within the three months preceding the initiation of a bankruptcy process.</p>\r\n<p>The amounts guaranteed to workers are: up to the minimum average monthly salary in Croatia for each month for which the salary has not been paid or for which an employee has the right to receive remuneration for sick leave; up to half of the minimum salary for remuneration claims for unused annual leave days; up to half of the legally prescribed employer&rsquo;s obligation for severance pay; up to a third of non-appealable remuneration for indemnification. Such claims are paid to workers by the agency responsible for ensuring workers&rsquo; claims in the event of an employer&rsquo;s bankruptcy. Payment comes from a special fund for covering bankruptcy costs if the funds available from the bankruptcy estate are not sufficient. Claims can be paid to workers provided that they have reported them to the agency or to the governing office of the Croatian employment service within 30 days from the governing court's decision on the bankruptcy estate or starting from the 8th day after the announcement of the bankruptcy process in the Official Gazette.</p>\r\n<p>The agency decides on the specific claim within 15 days of its submission and the relevant and finite decision on the claim's validity is, in the case of complaints made by subsequent workers, made by the governing ministry of labour and pension system within 30 days of the complaints' submission. Within 20 days of the decision, the agency must pay the claims either to the workers directly if the company has been closed down or to the company's account designated for this purpose, whose transactions are monitored by the bankruptcy manager. The bankruptcy manager must then transfer the recieved funds to the workers within eight days.</p>\r\n<p>Article 86.2 of the Bankruptcy Law prescribes that employees' claims above the guaranteed three salaries included in insured employees' claims, but up to three minimum gross monthly salaries in Croatia in total are included in the bankruptcy estate of the employer. It relates to the claims of all workers except those who were in top management positions.</p>"~"<p>86.2; 3</p>"~"<p>The agency is financed from the state budget. It becomes a bankruptcy creditor of the bankrupt company for the workers' claims that it has taken over. Information on payments made to workers claiming from particular companies is available on the agency's webpage. For instance, in January 2013 the agency paid HRK 8.6 million (&euro;1.14 million as at 22 July 2013), affecting 437 workers. It spent HRK 35.4 million (&euro;4.71 million) in February making payments to 1,753 workers. In March, HRK 16.4 million (&euro;2.18 million) was spent for 898 workers. HRK 3 million (&euro;0.4 million) was spent in April and this affected 175 workers. In May, the agency paid out HRK 7.7 million (&euro;1.02 million) to ensure payments for 476 workers and 237 workers' payments were provided in June, costing HRK 3.3 million (&euro;0.44 million).</p>\r\n<p>The bankruptcy manager can, subject to approval of a bankruptcy judge, conclude new term contracts with the employees in order to complete work in process and reduce possible damage. Salaries and other monetary compensations for workers are determined by the bankruptcy manager based on the approval of a bankruptcy judge and in line with regulations and collective agreements. Salaries and other employer obligations are covered by the bankruptcy estate (Bankruptcy Act, Article 120(5)-120(7)). The regional or local government can get involved indirectly if the bankruptcy concerns the well-being of a substantial part of their citizens and award additional one-off payments as an aid to redundant employees.

"Arbeitsvertragsrechts-Anpassungsgesetz (AVRAG)"~"Employment Law Harmonisation Act"~"<p>A business transfer in the understanding of this law refers to the sale or lease of (parts of) the company, transfer of ownership through gift or any other form of change in the entrepreneur, with general continuation of business activities with the previous organisational structure (including the take-over of a considerable number of employees), infrastructure and clientele. It might also be the result of a merger, joint venture or divestment. Operations that only result in the transfer of business function (for example, splitting off of operational duties without any assets and without the transfer of more than 10% of the staff) do not qualify as 'transfer' in the terminology of the law.</p>\r\n<p>The new entrepreneur automatically becomes the employer of all staff (including apprentices and executive staff members).&nbsp;&nbsp;That means&nbsp;all existing employment contracts are maintained unchanged unless employees agree to new provisions. Changes for the worse from the perspective of the employee effected shortly after the transfer may be declared void if the employee can prove that he/she agreed on those as a result of pressure.</p>\r\n<p>The seller or the buyer has to inform affected staff or, if such exists, the works council in writing at the latest before realising the transfer on</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the planned timing of the transfer;</li>\r\n<li>the reason for the transfer;</li>\r\n<li>the legal, economic and social consequences of the transfer for the employees;</li>\r\n<li>planned measures for the employees.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the seller of the company has to inform affected employees on the potential transfer of guarantees for severance payments and/or pension entitlements. The new owner has to inform the employees about changes in applicable collective agreements, changes in work agreements and any refusal to take over occupational pension or dismissal protection.</p>\r\n<p>This information can also be realised through posting information in a suitable location in the company that is easily accessible for the employees (for example, a company bulletin board).</p>\r\n<p>If there is a works council in the company, it may make recommendations on options to alleviate or avoid potential negative effects for the employees and might wish to cooperate in establishing a social plan for affected employees.</p>\r\n<p>The employees have the right to object to the transfer if</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the new employer refuses to acknowledge special protection against dismissal as set out in the collective agreement; or</li>\r\n<li>the new employer refuses to take over the occupational pension fund.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The employees have to raise their objection within one month. Then, the employment contract is deemed to remain with the original employer.</p>"~"<p>3, 3a</p>"~"<p>The Austrian Supreme Court has ruled that the employees can also object to the transfer if the continuation of the employment contract with the new owner has become unacceptable (for example, loss of the position as a works council member). However, this ruling was&nbsp;of high controversy&nbsp;and heavily criticised. It was never reproduced since then.</p>"~"<p><a href=""http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Dokumentnummer=NOR40118123&amp;ResultFunctionToken=36c7d9fe-f9c4-4393-a754-1033e8f842f2&amp;Position=1&amp;Kundmachungsorgan=&amp;Index=&amp;Titel=&amp;Gesetzesnummer=&amp;VonArtikel=&amp;BisArtikel=&amp;VonParagraf=&amp;BisParagraf=&amp;VonAnlage=&amp;BisAnlage=&amp;Typ=&amp;Kundmachungsnummer=&amp;Unterzeichnungsdatum=&amp;FassungVom=07.11.2013&amp;NormabschnittnummerKombination=Und&amp;ImRisSeit=Undefined&amp;ResultPageSize=100&amp;Suchworte=arbeitsvertragsrechts-anpassungsgesetz"">Arbeitsvertragsrechts-Anpassungsgesetz (AVRAG) &sect;3</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Dokumentnummer=NOR40028940&amp;ResultFunctionToken=9befd932-4863-487a-bf8e-ae26832e6d27&amp;Position=1&amp;Kundmachungsorgan=&amp;Index=&amp;Titel=&amp;Gesetzesnummer=&amp;VonArtikel=&amp;BisArtikel=&amp;VonParagraf=&amp;BisParagraf=&amp;VonAnlage=&amp;BisAnlage=&amp;Typ=&amp;Kundmachungsnummer=&amp;Unterzeichnungsdatum=&amp;FassungVom=07.11.2013&amp;NormabschnittnummerKombination=Und&amp;ImRisSeit=Undefined&amp;ResultPageSize=100&amp;Suchworte=arbeitsvertragsrechts-anpassungsgesetz"">Arbeitsvertragsrechts-Anpassungsgesetz (AVRAG) &sect;3a</a></p>"~"<p><a href=""http://portal.wko.at/wk/format_detail.wk?angid=1&amp;stid=442642&amp;dstid=0&amp;titel=Betriebs%c3%bcbergang%2c-%2carbeitsrechtlich"">Wirtschaftskammer &Ouml;sterreich (Austrian Federal Economic Chamber)</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://media.arbeiterkammer.at/wien/PDF/Publikationen/ArbeitundRecht/Betriebsuebergang.pdf"">Arbeiterkammer Wien (Chamber of Labour Vienna)</a></p>\r\n<p>Ius Laboris (2009), Transfers of Undertakings.

"Loi/wet du 29 mars/maart 2012 portant des dispositions diverses relatives au travail/Wet houdende diverse bepalingen"~"Labour Act of 29 March 2012"~"<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The daily eight-hour working time limit can be exceeded in response to an extraordinary workload</strong></span>. Authorisation from the relevant government authority and the agreement of the workers' union representative is required. An employee may work a maximum of 12 hours per day and 50 hours per week. Overtime work entitles the worker to extra compensation of 50% during weekdays and 100% on Sundays and public holidays. Under certain conditions, the workload can be defined on quarterly or annual basis. These regulation provides more flexible opportunities for companies to respond to the time-market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>In cases of economic hardship</strong></span>, the law-decree of 28 December 1944&nbsp; on social security of workers (temporary unemployment) completed with legal decrees of 3 May 1999, 26 March 2003, 29 March 2006 and 1 September 2006) suggests that the employer may establish a system of temporary unemployment for workers in totally suspending the execution of the employment contract or by establishing a system of short-time working, applicable to a certain number of employees and only after exhausting their recuperation days. Total (during all days of the week) or partial (at least keeping two working days a week) suspension of employment contracts is possible for a period of at least one or two weeks and up to a maximum of 16 or 26 weeks a year. This is a way to suspend temporarily the execution of the employment contract instead of&nbsp;cutting jobs&nbsp;when the business activities of the companies are not progressing well.</p>\r\n<p>Short-time working is available in the private sector and the semi-public sector &ndash; in public enterprises with an economic aspect, such as the rail service and the postal service. It applies to blue-collar workers, to employees during an economic downturn, and to those whose employability has been impacted by bad weather or an unforeseen event such as a technical accident. The measure must involve a group of workers, such as all those from one unit within a company or all blue-collar workers, and it also has to be temporary.</p>\r\n<p>The decrease in working time must be formally established by a collective agreement at the sectoral or company level or in the company's internal rules, thus requiring the agreement of the trade unions.</p>\r\n<p>The provision is assessed based on a worker's last monthly wage and can not exceed&nbsp;a maximum of &euro;2,206.46 per month (as of 2013). In the past, workers received 60% of their salary if they lived with their partner and 65% if they lived with their partner and children or lived alone during the period of temporary unemployment. On 7 April 2009, this percentage rose from 60% to 70% and 65% to 75% respectively, following new legislation aimed to boost the economy. This constituted an incease of &euro;300 for the maximum salary level.</p>\r\n<p>This new legislation also extended the measure to temporary workers and to those on a fixed-term contract. In cases of reduced working time, a variety of regimes or durations are possible. No time limitation is placed on situations where work is reduced to at least three days per week or one week per fortnight.</p>\r\n<p>A maximum period of three months is placed on cases where the employer has reduced working time of less than three days per week or, on a fortnightly schedule, of one week off and more than two days worked the following week. By royal decree, a maximum period of four weeks is extended to cases where work has been reduced to less than two days a week without specific derogation.</p>\r\n<p>These cases are generally dependent on the existence of a collective accord. The employee remains under contract to their employer during periods of temporary unemployment, even though the operation of the contract is suspended, and they retain all rights related to the contract. An additional right is conceded to workers on temporary unemployment &ndash; they are exempt from the requirement to give their employer notice of their intention to leave in order to work elsewhere.</p>\r\n<p>Workers and employees are not protected from dismissal during temporary unemployment but the period of dismissal notice may only begin after the temporary unemployment period has elapsed. Workers' long-term entitlements to pension, social security or health benefits are not negatively affected in situations where they are put on temporary unemployment. Temporary unemployment days are in the same category as days taken for sick leave &ndash; although not worked, they count towards the calculation of all benefits. This is financed by the social security budget of the state. The employer must notify the local branch of ONEM/RVA, the federal agency responsible for payment of unemployment benefits, as well as the workers affected and worker representatives at least one week in advance.</p>\r\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Time credit model </strong></span>is also used to reduce working time, based on the legal framework based on t<span>he law of 22 January 1985</span>. <span>Later,&nbsp;this framework&nbsp;was complemented by several collective agreements (77, 77bis, 103) in order to define what a&nbsp;time-credit is. This means that employees can take a complete interruption, a half time reduction or a one-fifth reduction. The complete interruption and the half time reduction apply for one year, extendible up to five years by collective agreement. The one-fifth reduction applies for five years in general and without any restriction for employees aged 50 and over. Women aged up to 50 are the main users for the time credit&nbsp;entitlements and the reduction of the working hours is the largely used form. The one-fifth reduction of working hours for employees aged 50 and over, however, is also commonly used by male workers. Given the unlimited duration of the entitlement for employees aged 50 and over, this particular system can be seen as a part-time early retirement scheme aiming to alleviate the end of a career.</span></p>"~"<p>1.<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong> Labour Act of 29 March 2012</strong></span> Articles 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29</p>\r\n<p>2. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Law-decree of 28 December 1944</strong></span> Articles 7-10</p>\r\n<p>3.<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong> Law of 3 May 1999</strong></span> Articles 1-7</p>\r\n<p>4. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Royal decree 26 March 2003</strong></span> Articles 1-9</p>\r\n<p>5. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Royal decree 29 March 2006</strong></span> Articles 1-5</p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Royal decree of 1 September 2006</strong></span> Articles 1-11</p>\r\n<p>7. <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Law of 22 January 1985</span></strong>: 99-107bis</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"~"<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Temporary unemployment</strong></span> is often used by SMEs in Belgium. It is funded by the national government.</p>\r\n<p>ONEM/RVA estimates that net employment losses in 2009 would have been nearly double the recorded 30,275, had the temporary unemployment scheme(s) not been in place. The Belgian employment rate declined by 0.5% over the year. The average daily number of employees benefiting from temporary unemployment allowances during the year was 28,185. An average of over 210,000 workers were on temporary unemployment each month. This represents a rise of 57% from 2008. The OECD estimates that this measure saved around 55,000 jobs in 2009. This instrument is established and well-known. It has a strong level of legitimacy among the social partners and the government. It offers employers both certainty and flexibility in relation to staffing levels as it provides, for example, the choice of whether or not to implement full or partial temporary unemployment, or to change leave days in the case of partial temporary unemployment. It enables companies to retain their human capital (and to a lesser extent, provide training). In addition, employees' income is cushioned during periods of temporary unemployment and access to long-term benefits and entitlements is not negatively affected.</p>\r\n<p>One weakness is the transfer of responsibility for the cost of flexibility from the company to the collective body, with public authorities paying a part of the unemployment benefit. The system can be hijacked by employers, often with the workers&rsquo; approval, and turned into an illicit means of avoiding taxes. In such cases, workers on temporary unemployment continue to work and are illegally paid by the company to do so. In addition, the two-week waiting period for approval of temporary unemployment requests from employers poses problems in terms of planning and this leads to employers making precautionary applications for temporary unemployment.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The time credit model&nbsp;</span></strong>limits the impact of a working time reduction by providing income support and enabling employees to keep their social security level. The time-credit is also useful in keeping older workers in the labour market.</p>\r\n<p>This time credit also means that 5% of the total number of workers in a company has the possibility to reduce their working times by one fifth of their total working time. The quota of 5% of simultaneous absence within the firm is determined by the <span class=""Organization"">National Employment Office</span> (<a href=""http://www.rva.be/home/menufr.htm"">Office National de S&eacute;curit&eacute; sociale &ndash; ONEM / Rijksdienst voor Arbeidsvoorziening &ndash; RVA</a>), but only for companies employing more than ten workers. The main goal of the quota is ensuring the continuity of work. However, this measure concerns every worker in the company and therefore, this is not specific to older workers. Nevertheless, it seems that many companies have informal agreement with the older workers who want to be in this system, even if the quota of 5% was exceeded.</p>\r\n<table border=""1""><caption><strong>Time Credit</strong></caption><colgroup><col width=""14.2%"" /><col width=""11%"" /><col width=""15.7%"" /><col width=""13.3%"" /><col width=""13.3%"" /><col width=""15.7%"" /><col width=""15.7%"" /></colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr><th rowspan=""2"">&nbsp;</th><th colspan=""6"">\r\n<p>Time Credit</p>\r\n</th></tr>\r\n<tr><th colspan=""3"">\r\n<p>Part-time job</p>\r\n</th><th colspan=""3"">\r\n<p>Full-time job</p>\r\n</th></tr>\r\n<tr><th>\r\n<p>Year</p>\r\n</th><th>\r\n<p>Men</p>\r\n</th><th>\r\n<p>Women</p>\r\n</th><th>\r\n<p>Total</p>\r\n</th><th>\r\n<p>Men</p>\r\n</th><th>\r\n<p>Women</p>\r\n</th><th>\r\n<p>Total</p>\r\n</th></tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2003</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>3.614</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>9.513</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>13.127</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>20.470</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>27.813</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>48.283</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2004</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>3.734</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>9.598</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>13.332</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>24.539</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>34.766</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>59.305</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2005</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>3.796</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>9.282</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>13.078</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>30.190</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>45.454</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>75.644</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2006</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>3.476</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>8.904</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>12.380</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>34.287</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>55.240</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>89.527</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>2007</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>3.062</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>8.470</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>11.532</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>37.879</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>62.212</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>100.091</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><span class=""Organization"">Federal Public Service Employment, Labour and Social Dialogue</span> <a href=""http://www.emploi.belgique.be/moduleTab.aspx?id=553&amp;idM=218"">(Service Public F&eacute;d&eacute;ral Emploi, Travail et Concertation Sociale / Federale Overheidsdienst Werkgelegenheid, Arbeid en Sociaal Overleg</a>)</p>"~"<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Working time flexibility</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Federal Public Service of Justice (in <a href=""http://www.emploi.belgique.be/defaultTab.aspx?id=29448"">French</a> -

"Sozialgesetzbuch (SGB III)"~"Social Code Book III"~"<p>The Social Code III provides for three forms of short-time working arrangements.</p>\r\n<p>The first, structural short time working,&nbsp;is applicable in case of a temporary and unavoidable shortfall of orders due to economic downturns/crisis or to unavoidable desasters.</p>\r\n<p>The second form is short-time working in the event of restructuring (Transferkurzarbeit). In this case, the duration of short-time working is used for training or job transfer measures.</p>\r\n<p>The third arrangement, seasonal short time working (Saisonkurzarbeit) is a sector-related instrument to weather typical seasonal downturns (i.e. in construction).</p>\r\n<p>In all of these cases, the employer must first consult the works council and then apply to the Federal Employment Ageny for approval if they want to introduce the scheme.</p>\r\n<p>The company has to have exhausted other options that might help to avoid using short-time working, such as granting leave days, use of holiday entitlements of previous years or of 10% of the working time acount of the running year).</p>\r\n<p>Short-time working may be set in place if one-third of the workforce is affected by a wage drop of over 10% due to a temporary decrease in workload. Workforce is defined as including standard and non-standard workers (excluding temporary agency workers and homeworkers).&nbsp;In the calendar month for which short-time working support is applied, at least one-third of a company's employees (or one or several specific units) must be concerned.</p>\r\n<p>If short-time working is approved by the Federal Employment Agency, the employer pays for the actual working time and the Federal Employment Agency contributes a short-time working allowance of 60% of the missing net wage. This increases to 67% if the worker is a parent. As of 2014, this allowance is provided for monthly wages that do not exceed &euro;5,950 in western Germany and &euro;5,000 in eastern Germany. This is subject to agreement by the works council and the public employment service.</p>\r\n<p>Short-time working allowances are granted to standard and non-standard workers liable to social security contribution. Workers with so-called &lsquo;mini-jobs&rsquo;, who are not liable to social security contribution (earning up to &euro;450 per month), temporary agency workers (holding a work contract with another employer) and trainees are excluded.</p>\r\n<p>The maximum duration of state-funded short-time working allowances is six months, but can be extended by ministerial decree to up to 12 months in cases of exceptional circumstances in the labour market in specific industries or regions. It can be extended by up to 24 months in cases of exceptional circumstances in the general labour market. Until 31 December 2014, duration is 12 months.</p>\r\n<p>While a company is receiving public short-time working support, new employees can only be recruited to sections of the company that are not subject to short-time working. Moreover, it has to be proven that the vacancy cannot be filled by one of the company's current short-time workers. Dismissals during short-time working are possible, but the worker has to return to full-time employment during the notice period, and the employer is no longer entitled to the public short-time working allowance for that worker.</p>"~"<p>96, 101, 111</p>"~"<p>The Federal Employment Agency provides <a title=""Kurzarbeit Statistik"" href=""http://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/Navigation/Statistik/Statistik-nach-Themen/Lohnersatzleistungen-SGBIII/Kurzarbeitergeld/Kurzarbeitergeld-Nav.html"">monthly and annual data on short time working</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Statistics and graphs showing the wide spread use of short time work in 2009/2010 and the subsequent decline are&nbsp;available under</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<a title=""Arbeitsmarkt in Zahlen"" href=""http://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/nn_32018/SiteGlobals/Forms/Rubrikensuche/Rubrikensuche_Form.html?view=processForm&amp;resourceId=210368&amp;input_=&amp;pageLocale=de&amp;topicId=255298&amp;year_month=aktuell&amp;year_month.GROUP=1&amp;search=Suchen"">Arbeitsmarkt in Zahlen. Statistik &uuml;ber Kurzarbeit von Betrieben und Kurzarbeitern</a></p>\r\n<p>Short-time work peaked during the crisis. Numbers of affected employees rose from 68,317, 101,450 to 1,144,407 in the three year period 2007 to 2009. Similarly the numbers of establishments using short-time work increased from 8,333 and 10,052 to 55,937 in the same time span. After 2009, numbers decreased from 502,694 affected workers in 2010 to 123,978 in 2013. The same holds true for employers: In 2010, 49,121 establishments were affected. This compares to 10,381 in 2013.</p>\r\n<p>The publicly supported short-time working arrangements are calculated to have accounted for about 300,000 to 350,000 saved jobs during the crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Strengths&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Drawing a short-time allowance does not affect eligibility periods for unemployment benefits. The measure offers companies cost and productivity advantages by adjusting working time to the market situation and volatile demand. The measure may also increase workers&rsquo; commitment towards the company, thereby strengthening their motivation and engagement. The measure makes it possible to react quickly and flexibly to volatile production levels, by enabling an immediate return to full-time work in case order levels improve. The need for severance payments and costs related to hiring and induction of new staff that may arise in case of dismissals is avoided. At the same time, workers benefit from job security. The public support partly compensates workers for their loss of income and allows them to maintain a certain level of social security; which in turn results in higher purchasing power and willingness to spend available funds. Finally, the measure creates a strong and constructive partnership between the representatives of employers and employees.</p>\r\n<p>Weaknesses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The measure is only feasible for financially strong firms: non-wage labour costs are not proportionally reduced as it is the case with wage and working time reduction. It is difficult to combine short-time working with training. An administrative burden is involved in the implementation of short-time working.</p>"~"<p><a title=""Sozialgesetzbuch III"" href=""http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_3/"">Social Code III</a></p>\r\n<p><a title=""Bundesagentur f&uuml;r Arbeit"" href=""http://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/Navigation/Statistik/Statistik-nach-Themen/Lohnersatzleistungen-SGBIII/Kurzarbeitergeld/Kurzarbeitergeld-Nav.html"">Federal Employment Agency</a></p>"~"<p>Brenke, K./Rinne, U./Zimmermann K.F.

"Code du travail; Loi 6234 du 22 Decembre 2010"~"Labour Code; Law No. 6234 of 22 December 2010"~"<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Short-time working</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Short-time working may be used when all other possible resolutions to a company's difficulties, including a reduction in the use of agency-supplied temporary workers, time off in lieu of overtime, the use of remaining holiday entitlements, and internal redeployment, have been exhausted.</p>\r\n<p>In order for short-time working for economic reasons to be permitted, there must be economic difficulties in a sector that has been declared to be in a state of crisis by the government council. The Committee for the Economy assesses the sector&rsquo;s situation and the company&rsquo;s individual situation. Moreover, the Committee must avoid creating situations of unfair competition. Companies concerned may not make any workers redundant for economic reasons while the short-time working scheme is in operation.</p>\r\n<p>Short-time working due to an economic dependency link applies when the applicant company is in a position of serious dependence on one or more companies that are already benefiting from the short-time working scheme in Luxembourg. In such cases, the benefits are the same as those provided for economic reasons. The company concerned may not make any workers redundant for economic reasons while the short-time working scheme is in operation.</p>\r\n<p>Short-time working on structural grounds applies to companies facing structural difficulties and aims to facilitate adaptation and enable them to maintain employment at a satisfactory level. The procedure is the same as for the other short-time working regimes. The Committee for the Economy&rsquo;s assessment will relate to the company&rsquo;s individual situation. In this case, the difficulties encountered are not purely due to widespread economic recession.</p>\r\n<p>In the case of partial unemployment due to unforeseeable circumstances, all employees working in Luxembourg on either permanent or fixed-term contracts (including part-time workers) who are fit for work are eligible, with the exemption of apprentices.</p>\r\n<p>Subsidies may be allocated to employers who, rather than making redundancies, undertake to maintain the employment relationship with their personnel and to pay them compensation for lost salary. Compensation for non-worked hours amounts to 80% of normal pay and is provided for all non-worked hours except the first 16 hours per month for full-time workers and the first 8 hours per month for part-time workers. There is a ceiling on the public reimbursement payable to employers, which is set at 250% of the minimum wage. The amount of time not worked under short-time working arrangements may not exceed 50% of the normal monthly hours worked. The maximum duration for public support is proposed by the conjuncture committee and varies among the different partial unemployment pathways, as outlined below.</p>\r\n<p>Public support for companies experiencing partial unemployment due to economic reasons is provided for a maximum of six months, over a twelve-month period. The hours subsidised per month cannot exceed 50% of the employee&rsquo;s normal working hours.</p>\r\n<p>The maximum duration for public support in the case of partial unemployment due to economic dependency is individually fixed on the basis of the partial unemployment duration of the firm(s) on which the company depends. The hours involved per month cannot exceed 50% of the employee&rsquo;s normal working hours.</p>\r\n<p>The duration of support for partial unemployment due to structural reasons is individually fixed on the basis of the restructuring plan submitted to the conjuncture committee. If applicable, this submission is accompanied by an employment maintenance plan. The hours involved per month cannot exceed 50% of the employee&rsquo;s normal working hours. For the non-worked hours, social contributions, which are borne by the employer, are based on the reduced salary (at 80%, or 90% for those taking part in training).</p>\r\n<p>In cases of dismissal following a period of partial unemployment, the unemployment benefits are calculated based on the full-time wage before partial unemployment. An exception to this is partial unemployment for structural reasons. In this case, the employer is obliged not to dismiss any workers for economic reasons during partial unemployment. They must also maintain their positions following the partial unemployment period, for at least the same length of time as the partial unemployment measure was being used.</p>\r\n<p>Companies have to apply for partial unemployment compensation to the so-called conjuncture committee, a tripartite body consisting of members representing the government (the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Finance), representatives of employers&rsquo; organisations and trade unions.</p>\r\n<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Time-saving accounts</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>At the request of employees, time-saving accounts can be introduced through internal regulations or a collective agreement to accumulate rights to paid leave in return for untaken leave or overtime work (compensated at a rate of 1.5 hours of time off for every extra hour worked). Alternatively, employees can gain additional paid leave in return for part of their renumeration (wage supplements for work on Sundays, bank holidays and night work). In this case, the proportion of salary exceeding the minimum wage is converted into time credits at the request of the employee, provided that this does not exceed 10% of their total annual wages.</p>\r\n<p>The collective agreement or time saving account scheme should record the beneficiaries, the rules for supplying, using or settling the account, the rules on transferability from one employer to another, and so on. When such a scheme is introduced without a collective agreement, the monetary exchange value of the acquired rights is registered with an insurance company. It manages the funds received and pays them to the employer in the case of complete or partial settlement of a time-saving account, or to the employee if the employer goes bankrupt.</p>\r\n<p>When the scheme is introduced in the context of collective bargaining, the parties are free to determine the way to secure employees' rights. Only permanent employees are entitled to avail of a time-saving scheme. The employer is in charge of managing the working time accounts and has to inform employees about applicable regulations and their working time credits. Employees can request a withdrawal from the scheme and this must be granted by the employer unless there are serious reasons for refusal.</p>"~"<p>Labour Code: L. 166-2; L. 212-9; L. 511-6; L. 511-11; L. 511-13; L. 512-10; L. 513-3; L. 521-15</p>"~"<p>In November 2013, 41 out of 44 demands for partial unemployment were approved by the conjoncture committee.

The legislation requires employers to inform the workers concerned in writing. In the written information, the employer has to indicate the reasons explaining the redundancies, and the motives excluding the adoption of alternative measures capable of avoiding or reducing the dismissals. Moreover, the employer must communicate the names and addresses of the redundant workers, as well as their jobs, skill level, job classification level, age, family components, the time table for the redundancy plans and the criteria for their selection, the measures to address the consequences of the redundancies and the method of calculating the various types of remuneration to the trade unions which had received notification of the start of the &lsquo;mobility procedure&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although the law encourages the parties to seek an agreement on ways of re-absorbing redundant personnel, it also leaves the employer free to reject the trade unions&rsquo; proposals. Likewise, the unions are free not to ask for a joint examination of the enterprise&rsquo;s crisis situation, nor to reach any form of agreement with the employer. &nbsp;The legislation specifies a maximum consultation period of 45 days (with a possible further 30 days' consultation with the regional or provincial authority). The consultation period can be extended 30 more days if employers and employees fail to reach agreement within 45 days. However, if the parties do not reach agreement on the mobility procedure, and if payment of the mobility allowance is stipulated, the cost to the enterprise is considerably greater. Following this maximum period of 75 days, notice of &nbsp;termination/mobility procedure should be given to the authorities, trade unions/employee representatives and employees.</p>\r\n<p>If less than 10 workers are involved, the duration of the collective dismissal procedure is reduced by half.

The relevant provisions provide that firms and undertakings with restricted economic activity may, instead of terminating an employment agreement, serve written notice temporarily laying-off salaried employees for no longer than 3 months annually, provided they have first consulted with the employees&rsquo; legal representatives. Employees&rsquo; representatives are defined, in the following order of priority, as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Representatives of the firm or undertaking&rsquo;s most representative trade union, covering, according to its statutes, employees irrespective of category, position or skill; </li>\r\n<li>Representatives of the firm or undertaking&rsquo;s existing trade unions; </li>\r\n<li>The works council; </li>\r\n<li>In the absence of trade unions or a works council, the entire workforce is notified and consulted with. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Notification may be via a single notice posted in a conspicuous and accessible place at the firm.

Rotating employment is considered to be employment for fewer days a week or fewer weeks a month or fewer months a year or a combination thereof compared to full-time work.

Employers have a legal obligation to start consultation before making a public announcement.</p>\r\n<p>During consultations regarding collective redundancies the employer and the employee representatives shall examine all the possibilities of avoiding the collective redundancy or of reducing the number of employees to be made redundant and how to alleviate the effects of such redundancy by taking social measures that create the possibility to further employ or retrain the employees made redundant.</p>\r\n<p>Any reduction of the number of employees (including collective redundancy) shall be sufficiently justified by urgent commercial, organisational, technological or similar measures to be implemented in the undertaking.</p>\r\n<p>Employee representatives have a general right to timely receive information and consult with the employer before adoption of such decisions that may affect the interests of employees, in particular, the salary, working conditions and employment with the company.</p>\r\n<p>Dismissal cannot be implemented prior to the lapsing of a 45 day period after the public authorities have been informed. In practice, this means that 45 days is considered the minimum period of consultation. In exceptional cases the State Employment Agency may extend the time limit to 60 days.</p>\r\n<p>The legislation states that employers must consult on the number of employees planned to be dismissed, the social guarantees for these employees, procedures for collective dismissal, and possible ways of minimising redundancies.</p>"~"<p>10, 11, 104, 105, 106, 107, 117, 120</p>"~"<p>In practice, consultation rarely happens.</p>"~"<table class=""data-view"" style=""width: 133px; height: 24px;"">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=""label""><a href=""http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=26019"">Labour law</a></td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>"~"<p>DG Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities/H&eacute;ra, 2011, Selected companies&rsquo; legal obligations regarding restructuring</p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/erm_car/tn0701046s.htm"">EMCC actors in restructuring</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/studies/tn0710029s/lv0710029q.htm"">Eurofound, 2009, The impact of the Information and Consultation Directive, EIROnline Articles</a></p>\r\n<p>Karnīte, R., 2011, Evaluation of the operation and effects of informationa and consultation directives in the EU/EEA countries, Fitness Check, National Report Latvia, European Commision, DG for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion</p>\r\n<p>Darba likums ar komentāriem, 2010, produced by BDO Zelmenis un Liberte, Riga, Riga Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia</p>\r\n<p>Kalnina, I., 2011, Protection of workers in case of transfers of enterprises.
