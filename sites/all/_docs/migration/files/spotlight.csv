"Youth Employment Initiative: Is it delivering?"~1405524018~1405524018~"<p>Defining effective measures to address youth unemployment remains a key policy priority for the EU, but the process is complex and time-consuming.</p><p>All Member States are making efforts to implement the <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1094&amp;langId=en"">Youth Guarantee</a> and have submitted national <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1090&amp;langId=en"">Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans</a> to the European Commission for evaluation.</p><p>Launched in February 2013, the <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/;ELX_SESSIONID=HDLDTFTP1RMQGWYhfxwJ3C5hVwFF21vkZv27MGrGr1LJjCPn6L10!1988065863?uri=CELEX:52013DC0144"">Youth Employment Initiative</a> (YEI) aims to tackle youth unemployment by supporting the implementation of the Youth Employment Package and the Youth Guarantee.</p><p>In total, 20 Member States are eligible for YEI funding, which are those with youth unemployment rates above 25% in 2012. The countries not eligible are Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands. However, availability of funding under the YEI is slower than expected.</p><h2>Youth Employment Initiative</h2><p>In particular, the YEI aims to support young people aged up to 25 who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs) via measures such as first job placements, apprenticeships, traineeships or start-up support for young entrepreneurs. Eurofound research estimates the cost of the 7.5 million NEETs in the EU to be around €153 billion.</p><p>A budget of €6 billion has been allocated for the YEI for the period 2014–2020. Half of the YEI funding comes from a new budget line dedicated to youth employment and has been frontloaded to 2014–2015. The other half will come from Member States’ European Social Fund (ESF) allocations. The idea is that activities receiving YEI funding should be strongly oriented towards achieving concrete results quickly.</p><h2>Slow implementation</h2><p>So far, the Commission has adopted YEI operational programmes for only two Member States – <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=89&amp;newsId=2073&amp;furtherNews=yes"">France</a> (3 June) and <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=1036&amp;newsId=2096&amp;furtherNews=yes"">Italy</a> (11 July). Although the Youth Guarantee targets young people up to the age of 25, Italy will extend this to people aged up to 29.&nbsp;</p><p>On 11 July, experts from the European Commission and eligible Member States convened at a special seminar in Brussels to seek ways of speeding up the programming arrangements and practical implementation of the YEI (see <a href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-784_en.htm?locale=en"">press release</a>).</p><p>According to Eurostat, despite some reduction since May 2013, youth unemployment in May 2014 in the EU28 stood at 22.2%, corresponding to 5.2 million young people under 25 who remain jobless, with very worrying trends still in Greece (57.7% March 2014), Spain (54%), Croatia (48.7% March 2014) and Italy (43%).&nbsp;</p><p>Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion László Andor said that YEI funding ‘has a crucial role to play since it shall directly support young people by providing a first job experience, a traineeship, an apprenticeship or training courses’. The aim of the seminar was to work together on the programming of those schemes due to receive YEI funding so that Member States could receive the allocated funds as soon as possible and get initiatives up and running.</p><p>Bulgaria, Croatia, Ireland, Poland and Sweden are also in the process of implementing projects to be funded by the YEI.</p>"~"The Youth Employment Initiative aims to directly support implementation of national youth guarantee schemes; yet, receipt of funding by eligible Member States is slower than expected.

"Which jobs employ most people in the EU? Which are growing and declining most?"~1404999828~1405009251~"<p>Close to 1 in 10 workers in the EU are employed in just two jobs – sales workers in the retail sector and teaching professionals in the education sector – according to findings from the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1419.htm"" title=""Link to the report"">European Jobs Monitor 2014</a>, just published.</p><p>This research identified over 3,000 jobs across the EU, defining a job as a specific occupation within a specific sector, and found that a small number of jobs account for a large amount of employment in all countries. One-quarter of EU employment is concentrated in the 10 below.</p><p>In countries where agriculture is a big employer, such as Greece and Romania, 20 jobs or fewer employ half of all workers.</p><p><img src=""/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u92/EJM%20-%20biggest%20jobs_0.png"" alt=""List of top 10 jobs that employ most people in the EU"" title=""Top 10 jobs by employment in the EU"" width=""536"" height=""219"" /></p><p></p><h2>Growing jobs</h2><p>The research also examined which jobs have grown most in the recent past and which have declined most. What is most notable about the jobs that have shown most growth is that they have tended to be at either end of the pay spectrum.</p><p>The top two jobs for growth – ICT professionals in computer programming and health professionals in the health sector – are in the top pay quintile. (This means that when all jobs are categorised into five categories of equal size on the basis of pay and ordered from lowest to highest, 1 to 5, these two jobs are in quintile 5). Two more of the top 10 for growth are in this quintile. Then the third, fourth and fifth jobs in the list are in the lowest-paying quintile, quintile 1.</p><p><img src=""/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u92/EJM%20-%20most%20gain%20-%20v02_0.png"" alt=""List of top 10 jobs that grew most"" title=""Top 10 jobs by greatest employment gain"" width=""536"" height=""219"" /></p><h2>Declining jobs</h2><p>The jobs that have declined most are nearly all middle-paying jobs (quintiles 2–4). Three are in the construction sector, where EU employment has decreased more or less continuously for five years. One is in agriculture, which is in long-term decline.</p><p><img src=""/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u92/EJM%20-%20most%20loss%20-v02_0.png"" alt=""List of top 10 jobs that lost most employees"" title=""Top 10 jobs by greatest employment loss"" width=""536"" height=""219"" /></p><p>According to some analysts, the decline of many middle-ranking jobs can be attributed to the nature of the tasks in those jobs: routine and systematic. These have been in decline over many years in developed economies as a result of workers being replaced by technology or jobs being lost because of offshoring and increased global competition.</p><p>It is notable that the gains in jobs that showed growth have been much more modest than the losses in the jobs that contracted. In only 2 jobs were there net increases of over 100,000 workers, compared to 11 jobs that experienced the same scale of net job losses.</p><p>This in part reflects the recession. It also reflects a greater relative concentration of losses in the top 10 declining jobs – 28% of total net loss occurred in these jobs – as well as a more even spread of gains across the growing jobs – only 18% of total net growth took place in the top 10 growing jobs.</p><p>Note: The appearance of health associate professionals in the human health activities sector in the list of declining jobs is surprising, as health sector employment tended to grow throughout the crisis. One possible explanation is an upgrading of occupations within the health sector in some Member States, with associate professionals being re-categorised as professionals. The fact that the related occupation of health professionals in human health services was one of the jobs with greatest gains lends some support to this possibility.</p>"~"Most workers in the EU are employed in a small number of jobs; current patterns show that the jobs with most growth have tended to be either high-paying or low-paying."~"EJM 2014.png"~6~0

What influences trust in public institutions? The question is worth exploring as understanding what bolsters trust – or undermines it – is a starting point in providing policymakers with the information to enable them to reverse the erosion of trust at both national and European level. Through its <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/2011/index.htm"">pan-European Quality of Life Survey</a>, Eurofound asked Europeans about their level of trust in a number of national public institutions – the parliament, legal system, police, press, government and local authorities.

"Quality of life, citizens and public services"~1404985298~1404985353~"<h2>Quality of life and EU policy</h2><p>The economic crisis means that many more Europeans are at risk of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion,&nbsp;which threaten&nbsp;serious negative impacts for individuals and societies.

Studying living conditions and quality of life is one of the main remits of Eurofound.</p><h2>Life satisfaction</h2><p>How we perceive the world we live in, our immediate surroundings, family, social contacts and society as a whole has an important impact on our personal well-being and life satisfaction. Belonging rather than feeling excluded, being able to combine working and non-working life, having access to good housing, education, health and other public services – all these are necessary conditions for citizens to be able to participate fully in society.</p><p>Eurofound's&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/index.htm"">European Quality of Life Survey</a> (EQLS) provides a picture of the present, but also of developments over time. This&nbsp;Europe-wide survey has been carried out since 2003, with the latest wave of results dating from 2011/2012. Included in the survey countries are the candidates for EU membership – <a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/quality-life/changing-fortunes-europes-newest-member-state"">among them Croatia</a>, now a new Member State.</p><h2>Ongoing analysis of the third EQLS</h2><p>The&nbsp;initial <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/2011/index.htm"">2012 EQLS report</a>&nbsp;shows the impact of the crisis on European society. Those insights are deepened with a series of recently published in-depth analytical reports that address a number of key themes, allowing Eurofound to provide new insights regarding the effect of the economic crisis and welfare reforms on living standards and quality of society for Europeans. The reports address the following topics:</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1364.htm"">trends in quality of life</a>;</li><li><a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1362.htm"">social inequalities</a>;</li><li><a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/quality-of-life/delivering-a-good-life-examining-subjective-well-being"">subjective well-being</a>;</li><li><a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1361.htm"">the quality of society&nbsp;and public services</a>.</li></ul><p>Findings from the reports highlight the diverse picture of quality of life across Europe. Scores for subjective well-being, for instance, have fallen in many western EU countries but those falls have been matched by increases in eastern countries, so that levels remain stable across the EU as a whole. People who face limiting physical ailments and those who are unemployed are more likely to have poorer well-being. Financial strain in households has grown in the wake of the economic crisis, with evidence of some aspects of disadvantage becoming more prevalent and social inequalities widening. Trust in institutions has decreased visibly, but trust in people has decreased less. And <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/quality-of-life/stemming-the-trend-of-declining-trust"">satisfaction with the quality of public services</a> makes it more likely that institutions will be trusted; greater inequality makes it less likely.&nbsp;</p><p>These findings and all EQLS data can be explored graphically in the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/smt/eqls/results.htm"">Survey Mapping Tool</a>.</p><p>In addition, a series of policy briefs highlight findings that are of particular interest from a policy perspective.

"Youth policy: Discussing ways forward"~1403882446~1403882477~"<p>European and international developments in youth policy, as well as the path Irish youth policy has taken over the past 30 years, were the focus of a <a href=""http://www.youthworkireland.ie/what-we-do/news/youth-policy-conference-nui-maynooth"">conference</a> on 25–26 June at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.</p><p>Eurofound Research Manager Anna Ludwinek presented findings on the social and employment situation of young people in the EU and policy pointers on this topic. She drew attention to the risks associated with the currently high youth unemployment rate, the 14.6 million young people under 30 not in employment, education or training (NEET) and the high rate of young people at risk of poverty and social exclusion due to the crisis.</p><p>She was joined by representatives of the European Commission, Council of Europe, United Nation's youth organisation and National Youth Council of Ireland, all of which have been actively working in different areas of youth policy including labour market participation, the role of youth work and recognition of non-formal education.</p><p>Download <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/docs/spotlight/2014/youth/youthpolicy_alu20140625.pdf"">Ms Ludwinek’s presentation (1.5 MB PDF)</a> from the event.</p><h2>Social situation</h2><p>Launched in March 2014, Eurofound’s policy brief on the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1404.htm"">Social situation of young people in Europe</a> shows the difficult situation young people are facing. The percentage of 18–29-year-olds living with their parents has increased from 44% in 2007 to 48% in 2011; this is the case for both men and women. Countries showing a dramatic rise of 15 percentage points or more include Hungary, Slovenia, Lithuania and Poland.</p><p>Despite unemployment levels and having to live with their parents, in general young people are more satisfied with their family and social life than other age groups. However, those who are unemployed, those with children and those living with their parents report the lowest satisfaction with social life.</p><p>Ms Ludwinek highlighted that around half of all young people in the EU live in households experiencing some form of deprivation. The most vulnerable groups are those who are unemployed, inactive in the labour market or young people living with their children and their parents. The rate of young people experiencing serious deprivation increased by six percentage points between 2007 and 2011, with those in the southern European Member States hardest hit.</p><p>A lack of employment opportunities has a large impact on perceived social exclusion. Unemployed or inactive young people feel the most excluded from society and are also more likely to feel lonely.</p><h2>Areas to improve</h2><ul><li>Unemployment remains a huge barrier to independence for young people. Therefore, European and national policies must recognise the importance of having a successful transition into employment and adulthood.</li><li>Moreover, policies should accommodate flexible arrangements that would give young people with children who want to work the chance to combine work and care obligations.</li><li>Low ratings on well-being and life satisfaction among unemployed and inactive young people point to the need to avoid possible long-term effects on mental health and well-being. Governments and service providers should take stock of the emerging need for increased services for young people.</li><li>Youth organisations will also play an important role in reaching out to disengaged young people.</li><li>Volunteering and active citizenship are positive tools to get young people into work and to help build social capital. Positive examples in this regard include Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK.</li></ul><h2>Youth employment</h2><p>This discussion followed the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) adoption of the opinion on <a href=""http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.soc-opinions.30507"">Youth employment measures – best practices</a> in early June. Under the measures to facilitate the transition between school and professional life, the opinion highlights Ireland’s <a href=""http://www.jobbridge.ie/"">JobBridge</a> programme. This offers work experience placements for periods of 6–9 months for young people who have been claiming social benefits for at least 78 days. However, the EESC argues that such youth activation measures need to happen earlier, as long waiting times for qualification may lead to discouragement among young people.</p><h2>Social inclusion policy</h2><p>Eurofound is currently carrying out a study looking at effective policies and initiatives for the social inclusion of young people and reintegrating this group into the labour market. A final report will be prepared towards the end of 2014. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the report <em><strong>Mapping youth transitions in Europe</strong></em> will be published end of July 2014. The study analyses the labour market situation of young people in Europe, focusing on their school-to-work transition and also their more general transition to adulthood.</p>"~"The National University of Ireland Maynooth held a youth policy conference on 25–26 June to look at national, European and international developments.

"Context: Work, care and inclusion of older people"~1403598081~1403618965~"<p>Demographic ageing presents a major challenge for policymakers across <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2012/2012-ageing-report_en.htm"">Europe</a>, with&nbsp;implications for&nbsp;both society and the working&nbsp;population. The share of older people in the total population is expected to increase significantly&nbsp;over the coming decades. According to <a href=""http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Population_projections"" title=""Population projections from Eurostat"">Eurostat</a>, people aged 65 and older will make up 30% of the European Union population by 2060 – almost double the 2012 figure of 17%. At the same time, the working age population (currently characterised as people aged 15–64 years) which peaked&nbsp;at 67% in 2010 is predicted to decline steadily to 59% by 2060.</p><p>At EU level, concerns about the sustainability of pensions, economic growth and labour supply have triggered policy responses to support the goals of longer working lives and later retirement.&nbsp;The main thrust of the European Commission's <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1062&amp;langId=en"">active ageing</a> policy is helping people to stay in charge of their own lives for as long as possible as they age and, where possible, to contribute to the economy and to society.</p><h2>Making work sustainable</h2><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">There is increasing pressure for people across&nbsp;Europe to work to an older age, both to satisfy the&nbsp;future demand for labour and to&nbsp;provide for the social expenditure required by&nbsp;older people&nbsp;for a range of&nbsp;social and healthcare services.

It finds evidence to suggest that a significant proportion of retirees would like to work for at least a few hours per week.</p><h2>Care matters</h2><p>The interactions between employment and caring are becoming increasingly important in the face of demographic ageing in Europe. In order to guarantee the sustainability of long-term care systems,&nbsp;an extensive contribution from informal carers will be necessary. A sizeable proportion of the workforce (men and women)&nbsp;are already juggling their paid employment with caring responsibilities, and vice versa, and this looks set to increase&nbsp;over the coming years.</p><p>Eurofound has investigated <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/populationandsociety/workingcaring/search.php"">cases</a> in companies across Europe that have adopted&nbsp;measures to support employees who have&nbsp;care responsibilities either for children or adults. Key initiatives include: leave arrangements, reduced working hours, counselling and practical support. The <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1147.htm"">report </a>concludes that addressing the work–family balance needs of working carers can be a&nbsp; ‘win–win’ outcome for employers and employees.</p><p>Many of the challenges posed by population ageing relate to the increasing demand for health care, especially long-term care, and the need for a trained workforce to provide care for older persons. Eurofound research has looked into employment growth in the health and social care sector driven by population ageing. It examined strategies in 10&nbsp;Member States aimed at creating <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1353.htm"">more and better jobs </a>in long-term care in order to tackle the&nbsp;problems of recruiting and retaining staff in the sector</p><h2>Active inclusion</h2><p>The European Commission's <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1062&amp;langId=en"">active ageing </a>strategy aims to increase awareness of the contribution older people can make, whether at work, in the home or in the community. One way of&nbsp;countering the potential social exclusion of this group is to promote the benefits of voluntary work among older people.

"Tapping the potential of born-global enterprises"~1403174861~1403521609~"<p>Start-up and young enterprises are widely seen as a rich vein of job creation. Not all have a plan or the potential for growth, however. So for governments and policymakers seeking to boost start-ups in their efforts to stimulate job growth, it makes sense to identify those that intend to expand.</p><p>One type in particular that tends create jobs at a faster pace than others are the ‘born globals’ – enterprises that internationalise rapidly from inception, deviating from the traditional approach of first building up a home market and then possibly going global.</p><p>Eurofound presented results of its ongoing research on born globals at the recent International Council for Small Business (ICSB) World Conference on Entrepreneurship in Dublin, with the theme of ‘Entrepreneurship and sustainability’.</p><h2>More and better jobs</h2><p>This orientation towards targeting multiple international markets, alongside the process of establishing a business and intensive product development, not only at the same time but also rapidly (as the speed of the process is one of the main success factors), means that these enterprises are likely to need more resources than a conventional start-up.</p><p>Almost one-fifth of born-global start-ups employ 10 or more workers, compared to 12% of start-ups focused on the home market. They also tend to offer better jobs – jobs that require high skills, promote teamwork, value creativity and pay well.</p><p>And they’re not a minor phenomenon: Eurofound’s research suggests that around one-fifth of young European companies are in this category.</p><p><img src=""/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u92/Employee%20numbers.png"" alt=""Comparison of employee numbers in born-global version conventional start-ups"" width=""800"" height=""498"" style=""width: 522px; height: 266px;"" /></p><h2>Dynamic and innovative</h2><p>Innovation is at the core of the born global. Their products are usually specialised or differentiated by design, are targeted at niche international markets and are produced using cutting-edge technology.</p><p>International networks, supported by internet-based communication technologies, play a crucial role in the design and implementation of their business model and create social capital. They also help to foster the development of other firms in the networks.</p><p>Alongside their distinctive profile, they have distinctive challenges, which not infrequently sink them before they ever reach their potential. Their funding needs are much higher, but they have less access to finance because they lack a track record and have the image of being a riskier investment.</p><p>Human capital costs are high because of their need for staff with knowledge of foreign markets and international business strategies, and technical staff with highly specialised product development skills. Globalisation is something of a double-edged sword as it exposes them to harsh global competition that can threaten to their emergence and sustainability.</p><h2>Invisibility</h2><p>Eurofound has found that across Europe born globals don’t figure much for policymakers, partly due to the lack of a common understanding of what a born global is. Hence specific support is rare. This, in general, is not too problematic as a wide range of public start-up, internationalisation and innovation support is available to born globals, if not explicitly targeted at them.</p><p>At the same time, however, the research found examples of public support that implicitly disqualify born globals from eligibility, so room for improvement exists.</p><p>Eurofound's&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/docs/spotlight/2014/employment/bornglobal_20140619.PDF"">paper from the conference (466KB PDF)</a>, which is based on the&nbsp;report <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1265.htm"" title=""Born globals: The potential of job creation in new international businesses""><em>Born globals: The potential of job&nbsp;creation in new international businesses</em></a>&nbsp;underlines the need for more visibility of born globals among European policymakers as a sound business model that can contribute to solving stagnant growth and unemployment in the aftermath of the economic downturn. Pinning down a concrete European definition of this business model would be a good place to start.</p>"~"Business start-ups that are oriented towards global markets from inception are more likely to create jobs than those focused on the home market; European policymakers should take note."~"Born global - conference - 2014-06-13.jpg"~6~0

"Addressing political disengagement"~1400574764~1400574764~"<p>Ongoing economic hardship is correlated with a decline in the trust Europeans feel for their political institutions, as was made clear by Eurofound research findings presented at a recent seminar on tackling political disengagement in advance of the upcoming European Parliament elections in May. A key element in this disengagement is the falling levels of trust that Eurofound's <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/index.htm"">European Quality of Life Survey</a> (EQLS) has documented across the Member States. Eurofound research manager Daphne Natalie Ahrendt outlined some of the survey’s key findings at the <a href=""http://www.coface-eu.org/en/Events/FamiliesVOTE2014/"" title=""Link to videos of event"">joint seminar coordinated by Eurofound and COFACE</a>, and highlighted how these correlated with deprivation and sociodemographic characteristics.&nbsp;</p><h2>European or not?</h2><p>Findings from the Eurobarometer survey show a relatively high proportion of Europeans on average – 62% – feel themselves to be EU citizens; in countries hardest hit by the crisis, however, this feeling of being European has declined markedly: in Greece, the figure is as low as 44%.&nbsp;</p><h2>Trust declines across EU</h2><p>Across Europe generally, findings point to a crisis of faith in public institutions since the advent of the economic crisis. Results from the autumn 2013 Eurobarometer show that trust in the EU has fallen: in spring 2007, some 57% of respondents said they trusted the EU; in autumn 2013 that had fallen to 31%. However, in countries that have been hit hardest by the crisis, levels of trust are much lower: 19% in Greece for instance, and only 13% in Cyprus. The EQLS found a similarly wide discrepancy between Member States in terms of levels of trust in national political institutions, as outlined in the figure.</p><p><strong>Trust in national institutions</strong></p><p><strong><img src=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u96/Trust%20in%20national%20institutions%20500px.png"" alt=""Graphic showing country variations in trust in national institutions"" title=""Country variations in trust in national institutions"" width=""500"" height=""307"" /></strong></p><p></p><p>Economic concerns lead to falling trust: surveys from the Eurobarometer bear this out. But it’s not just the EU that is being less trusted: ongoing decline in trust in national governments mirrors the decline in trust in the EU. In fact, as the graph shows, levels of trust in the EU remain higher than trust in national institutions. However, as Ms Ahrendt highlighted, ‘it is such a difficult task for the EU to refute the portrayal that falling trust is solely an EU problem.’</p><p><strong>Falling levels of trust not unique to EU</strong></p><p><img src=""/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u96/falling%20trust%20doctored%20500px.png"" alt=""Graphic showing EU citizens' falling levels of trust in the EU and their national institutions"" title=""Falling trust in EU and national institutions"" width=""500"" height=""344"" /></p><p></p><h2>Hardship and declining trust</h2><p>In countries where there are grave concerns about the economy, levels of trust have declined most sharply. In Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Hungary almost 100% of respondents to a Eurobarometer survey expressed concern about the economy; and it is in these countries that levels of trust have declined the most. The EQLS backs this up: regardless of the type of economic hardship suffered, people who are in difficulty trust their national government less than average. Given that there is more unemployment and more economic hardship in the wake of the crisis, the base for distrust is hence also growing.</p><p><strong>Levels of trust in government by financial circumstances</strong></p><p><img src=""/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u96/By%20economic%20circumstances%20500px.png"" alt=""Graph showing levels of trust in the national government by type of material hardship"" title=""Trust in government and material hardship"" width=""500"" height=""273"" /></p><h2>Solutions</h2><p>To restore trust is a long-term, complex process, Ms Ahrendt stressed. However, the EQLS points to some possible ways in which to work towards this. The survey’s findings indicate that a key factor in greater trust is good-quality public services – doctors, schools, transport and childcare. Ensuring equal access to good services has the scope to boost levels of political trust, over the long term.</p><p>And interestingly, people who volunteer score higher in terms of their trust in institutions: out of a score of 10, they rated their trust at 4.8, as against 3.9 for those who did not volunteer. Governments could do more to recognise the value of volunteering, and to boost the public’s awareness of the benefits of volunteering to themselves and to their communities.</p><h2>Further information</h2><p>A video of Ms Ahrendt's full presentation is available on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtcPSY9kvtI&amp;list=PL9wxOCin4v8kcynGm5LyMBb6REZMv4kBv&amp;index=3"" title=""Link to video of presentation on YouTube"">YouTube</a>.</p><p>Eurofound's <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1374.htm"" title=""Link to Eurofound policy brief"">policy brief detailing the issues surrounding politcal trust and civic engagement</a> is available online; also available in <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1374_de.htm"" title=""Link to German-language version of policy brief"">German</a> and <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1374_fr.htm"" title=""Link to French-language version of policy brief"">French</a>.</p><p></p>"~"The ongoing economic hardship is linked with the decline in trust in political institutions across the EU: Read about Eurofound research findings presented at a seminar on tackling political disengagement ahead of the European Parliament elections."~"EF1374 a.jpg"~5~0

"Youth on Europe day: Building ideas for a better Europe"~1400086984~1400087437~"<p>In order to emerge from the crisis successfully, the EU needs new ideas to build a bright future for its citizens. Aiming to gather ideas, the <a href=""http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eye2014/en/news/news.html"">European Youth Event</a> took place at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 9–11 May, kicking off on Europe Day.</p><p>Some 8,000 young people from around the EU joined decision-makers, experts, youth groups and business representatives in a wide range of discussions and workshops to contribute to building ‘Ideas for a better Europe’.</p><p>Participants joined in activities organised around five themes: youth unemployment, digital revolution, future of the EU, sustainability and European values. Activities included ‘Ideas Labs’ where they could get together with their peers from around Europe to discuss topics of direct interest to them, and role-play games where they could simulate the working of the Parliament. Adding to the mix a variety of cultural and sports activities, organised by the European Youth Forum as part of its annual youth festival <a href=""http://www.yofest.eu/"">YO!Fest</a>, also allowed them to network informally and experience Europe’s cultural diversity.</p><h2>Youth unemployment</h2><p>On 9 May, Eurofound Research Manager Anna Ludwinek participated in the ‘Youth unemployment’ theme. As part of the panel ‘Life on hold’, the emphasis was on the current state of youth unemployment in Europe, looking for ways to remove obstacles to finding jobs and highlighting new opportunities for young people.</p><p>Although these young people are better educated than their parents, with the current state of the economy they have fewer professional opportunities. Ms Ludwinek joined representatives from the Centre for European Policy Studies and the Spanish Youth Council in presenting experiences and ideas, discussing them with Catherine Trautmann, French Socialist MEP, as well as young audience participants.</p><p>Drawing on Eurofound research on the ‘<a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1404.htm"" title=""Read the report"">Social situation of young people in Europe</a>’, Ms Ludwinek addressed youth inclusion, speaking about the links between social inclusion and labour market inclusion. She highlighted that an increasing number of young people are living with their parents and asked participants how this might affect young people’s transitions into adulthood and their inclusion in the labour market.</p><p>The findings show that youth transitions from education to work and also into adulthood have become much more unpredictable and unstable, and they are now very different from the experiences of their parents or grandparents. Another interesting dimension, she emphasised, is the way young people communicate via much more frequent use of information and communication technologies and questioned whether these channels are used enough in job search or employment outreach activities.</p><p>Other interactive activities under this theme focused on aspects of youth unemployment and employment. These included vocational education and training, the Youth Guarantee, studying abroad, entrepreneurship, mobility, equal opportunities, among others, and participants heard real-life experiences of people who changed career path to entrepreneurship.</p><h2>Other topics of debate</h2><p>Under the discussions on ‘Digital revolution’ and the future of the internet, young people offered ideas on the opportunities and challenges associated with the world of computers, smartphones and online communication, all of which have shaped and educated their generation.</p><p>The third theme centred around the ‘Future of the European Union’ and whether the younger generation can make it better. Participants exchanged ideas with decision-makers on issues relating to crisis management, what kind of Europe they want to see, the European agenda of tomorrow, and many others.</p><p>Discussions on ‘Sustainability’ focused on how Europe can change course successfully – economically, environmentally and socially – in creating sustainable business and living, where topics of debate included the European Central Bank and the euro, financial markets and good governance, energy resources and greening.</p><p>Under the final theme ‘European values’, young people were invited to give opinions on whether they think Europe is a good neighbour and a fair partner in the world, issues around human rights, globalisation, manufacturing and trade, and an inclusive European society.</p><h2>Outcome</h2><p>The EYE aimed to give young people a voice in how the EU can be ‘reinvented’ and to encourage discussion on policy issues ahead of the European elections at the end of May. The outcomes of the discussions and events will be summarised in a report to be presented to the elected MEPs, serving as a reference for them throughout the new legislative period 2014–2019. <br /><br />Read more in the <a href=""http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eye2014/en/programme-.html"">event programme</a></p>"~"Thousands of young people from across the EU joined decision-makers in Strasbourg for the European Youth Event on Europe Day, 9 May.

Since the onset of the crisis, employment has shown a pattern of polarisation, with growth in top-paying jobs, while jobs in the middle of the pay spectrum have been destroyed in large numbers. The resilient jobs have tended to be in knowledge-intensive services in both the public sector (health and education, for example) and the private sector.</p><p>The EJM also looks at aspects of job quality other than wages&nbsp;– the educational level of workers and other non-pecuniary attributes of job quality. When assessed on non-wage attributes, the pattern of structural change in the jobs market is not one of polarisation but of upgrading. Jobs in Europe are growing in quality, but the&nbsp;challenge of having enough jobs remains.</p><h2>Reform and change</h2><p>Well-functioning labour markets are a prerequisite not only to overcoming the crisis but also for a sustainable recovery and for future growth.

"Employment slides in green energy technology manufacturing"~1399014981~1399375135~"<p>The once-booming solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing sector (which produces solar panels and cells) has seen&nbsp;its fortunes dive&nbsp;in recent years.</p><p>In the 2000s, the industry flourished, recording growth levels in global capacity of 58% annually between 2007 and 2011.</p><p>This expansion was largely driven by state subsidies, which have since been pared back. In addition, global competition, from China especially, has driven down prices. These two factors have triggered a crisis in the industry, leading to a scaling back of production and sharp job losses.&nbsp;</p><h2>German job losses</h2><p>The latest issue of Eurofound's <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1423.htm"" title=""Link to ERM quarterly"">ERM quarterly</a> highlights the situation in Germany, which dominates the industry in Europe. At its peak in 2008, Germany accounted for one-fifth of global production of PV panels and cells.</p><p>Problems of global overcapacity and uncertainty about state financial support, however, have cost thousands of jobs since 2011. Between early 2012 and early 2013, employment in the sector in Germany dropped from 10,196 to 5,973.</p><p>The case of solar panel manufacturer Solon is illustrative. In March this year, the company announced that it would be relocating its headquarters to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and closing its remaining facilities in Germany, with the loss of 230 jobs.</p><p>The company had been an industry success story; founded in 1996, it had sales of €815 million in 2008 and employed nearly 1,000 people in Germany, France, Italy and the US. However, it filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and was later acquired by UAE-based Microsol.</p><h2>R&amp;D potential</h2><p>The job-creation potential of the greening of the economy has given rise to much optimism.

"Progress towards making the Youth Guarantee happen"~1397558246~1397578821~"<p>One year on since EU agreement on the Youth Guarantee, the European Commission hosted a conference – <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/events/2014/youthguarantee/index.htm"">Youth Guarantee: Making it happen</a> – in Brussels on 8 April to discuss progress towards implementation across Member States.</p><p>Participating were government officials, Youth Guarantee coordinators, EU and national social partners, MEPs, representatives of international organisations, youth organisations, public employment services, the G20 Task Force on Employment and others who have a role to play in implementing the <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013H0426%2801%29&amp;from=EN"">Council Recommendation on establishing a Youth Guarantee</a>, adopted in April 2013.</p><p>In his opening address, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, <strong>László Andor</strong>, said the idea of the conference was to discuss the practical implementation of the Youth Guarantee by bringing together those involved directly in the design and implementation of the various schemes on the ground.</p><p>Member States were requested to submit Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans laying out how young people under 25 will receive a quality offer of employment, education, apprenticeship or training within four months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed. Mr Andor confirmed that 23 Member States have already prepared these plans and ‘delivery is taking off’.

With signs of economic recovery, promoting youth employment must be a top priority. The Youth Guarantee, he said, ‘is about rolling out quality traineeships and apprenticeships on a much larger scale than before’. He emphasised that young people will only embrace Europe if Europe embraces them.</p><p>Calling on Member States to invest in ‘quality jobs’ for these young people, he stated that ‘Europe can only prosper if we give our young people opportunities’. Quoting Eurofound’s <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/ecs/2013/index.htm"">European Company Survey 2013</a>, he highlighted that about 40% of firms across the EU have difficulties finding staff with the right skills. The Youth Guarantee is therefore a ‘key investment for the future’. With the political will to tackle youth unemployment, it is a priority to speed up preparations for the Youth Employment Initiative funding of €6 billion for regions with youth unemployment rates above 25%. President Barroso believes the Youth Guarantee’s success depends greatly on ‘sharing ownership’ among the various players.</p><h2>Shared ownership</h2><p>This message of shared ownership resonated throughout the conference as participants endorsed the view that a joint effort is necessary and that the Youth Guarantee should not be seen as a ‘quick fix’ but as a long-term structural reform to improve school-to-work transitions. Young people must be consulted on the implementation of measures and youth organisations, education providers and public employment services will play a central role in the uptake of the Guarantee.</p><p>Participating in the session on ‘Implementing the Youth Guarantee in countries with high youth unemployment’, Eurofound Research Manager <strong>Massimiliano Mascherini</strong> presented findings on youth in Europe, particularly those who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs). Listening to the Youth Guarantee Coordinators in Portugal, Spain and Ireland, who spoke about the challenges in their respective countries, he said he was delighted to see the focus on NEETs.</p><p>He reiterated that the various interventions in the various countries have to take into account that this is a very heterogeneous population and interventions have to match the characteristics and needs of these young people – particularly discouraged workers and young women with family responsibilities. He highlighted the Nordic model of the Youth Guarantee as an example of good practice in how their development plans can optimise that match between the job-seeker and the intervention.</p><p><img src=""/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u90/massi%20participating%20at%20youth%20guarantee-making%20it%20happen.jpg"" alt=""Photo of panellists in session on ‘Implementing the Youth Guarantee in countries with high youth unemployment’, Youth Guarantee: Making it happen, Brussels, 8 April 2014"" title=""Panellists in session on ‘Implementing the Youth Guarantee in countries with high youth unemployment’, 8 April 2014.

"Societal shifts transforming labour markets"~1396472400~1396856960~"<p>European societies are undergoing social, cultural and economic transitions that will have significant implications for the labour markets of the future. The European Commission has funded a research project, NEUJOBS, to analyse how labour markets are likely to develop in light of these transitions, and Eurofound will be taking part in a workshop organised in the context of this initiative.</p><p>‘Employment 2025 – How will multiple transitions affect the European labour market?’ takes place on 8–11 April in Bonn and will examine the possible impact of societal shifts on particular groups in the labour force, such as women and older people, and on different sectors of the economy, including health and social care. Eurofound’s Anna Ludwinek will participate in the discussion panel on care and social inclusion services.</p><h2>Care sector jobs</h2><p>The social-care services sector is likely to be a major source of job growth over the coming decades. As the population ages, the number of people with dementia, chronic illnesses and disabilities and in need of care is rising. At the same time, the provision of informal care by family members is dwindling as more women are working outside the home. The OECD expects&nbsp;demand for care workers to double or triple between now and 2050.</p><p>However, the care sector has enduring labour shortages because of high staff turnover and failure to attract recruits in sufficient numbers. Existing and potential employees are discouraged by low pay, demanding working conditions and poor career prospects.</p><h2>Overcoming barriers</h2><p>Eurofound research on <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1353.htm"" title=""Link to More and better jobs in home-care services report"">more and better jobs in home-care services</a> sought to identify initiatives across Europe that overcame these barriers to recruiting and retaining care&nbsp;staff – such as home helps, social care workers, community workers and district nurses.</p><p>The research identified a variety of successful initiatives. Some, for instance, were aimed at tapping existing labour market reserves, including the unemployed, migrants and disabled people; others were aimed at professionalising staff and giving them greater responsibility.</p><p>The research found that some measures could successfully transfer to other organisations and regions, as long as the strategy was well thought out. It also concluded that such initiatives could be effective at integrating workers at the margins of the formal labour market.</p>"~"Transitions within European societies will shape the development of labour markets, and care services for adults is one sector that will expand significantly."~"Woman with home help cleaner -reduced.jpg"~6~0

This increase seen between 2007 and 2011 points to a longer-term societal shift with potentially profound consequences – not least, in terms of concerns about birth rates across Europe and the continent’s demographic ageing.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, a dramatic increase in the proportion of young people experiencing serious deprivation is visible from the survey data.</p><h3>Figure: Experience of serious deprivation, 2007 and 2011 (%)</h3><p><img src=""/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u96/deprivation%20graph_0.png"" alt=""Graph showing extent of deprivation among young people in EU, 2007 and 2011"" title=""Experience of serious deprivation, 2007 and 2011 (%)"" width=""623"" height=""600"" /></p><p>What the graph does not show is the greater risk of deprivation among young people who are unemployed, economically inactive, and those living with their parents and with children of their own; these young people in multigenerational households are also most likely to feel themselves excluded from wider society.</p><h2>Important resources</h2><p>While Europe’s young adults face serious challenges, they also have important resources to draw on:</p><ul><li>greater satisfaction with their social and family and social life than other age groups;</li><li>high levels of social engagement, in the form of cultural activities, sport and volunteering;&nbsp;</li><li>a high degree of optimism.</li></ul><p>This was echoed by delegates at the event, who spoke of the engagement, positivity and resourcefulness of young adults – often obscured, they said, by popular portrayals of today’s young people as self-absorbed and individualistic.&nbsp;</p><h2>Broad approach</h2><p>Ms Ludwinek highlighted that engagement of young people had to be considered in two dimensions: in the labour market and in society in a broader sense. Echoing this, Robert Anderson, head of Eurofound's Living Conditions and Quality of Life unit, noted that the Agency is convinced of the importance of having information on such issues as participation and exclusion to complement standard measures of poverty and so gain a multidimensional picture of quality of life.</p><p>This comprehensive and holistic &nbsp;approach – including economic, social, personal and family concerns – mirrors the joint priorities of the <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/youth/policy/youth_strategy/index_en.htm"">European Youth Strategy</a>: to provide better opportunities for young people both in education and in the job market, and to encourage young people to actively participate in society.</p><p>The policy brief, published as part of the Foundation Findings series, is available for download at <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1404.htm"">www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1404.htm</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The EQLS findings are also available online to explore in the interactive <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/smt/eqls/results.htm"">Survey Mapping Tool</a>.</p><p></p>"~"Eurofound's new policy brief on the social situation of young people highlights the challenges they face in the wake of the economic crisis, and the substantial personal and social resources they possess."~"1333_010.JPG"~9~0

Life satisfaction measures how people evaluate their life overall, taking all life circumstances into account; it can be viewed as a person’s measure of their success in life. Over the three waves of the survey from 2003 to 2012, people were asked to rate how satisfied they were with their lives on a scale of 1–10.&nbsp;</p><h2>What influences life satisfaction?</h2><p>With almost 44,000 people interviewed in 34 countries in 2011–2012, Eurofound has been able to map <a href=""http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Quality_of_life_indicators_-_overall_experience_of_life"" title=""Link to Eurostat page 'Quality of life indicators - overall experience of life'"">relationships between life satisfaction and a wide range of key variables</a>. People stuck in long-term unemployment are much less satisfied with their lives than those with jobs. Having a strong sense of purpose in life is correlated being more satisfied with one’s life. Those who have a high income are more satisfied.</p><p>Age is also a factor: younger people are more satisfied with their lives. In most countries, life satisfaction falls consistently until the age of 65, after which it increases again, sometimes resulting in senior citizens being as, or even more, satisfied with their lives&nbsp;than the youngest generation. However, in some countries life satisfaction decreases continuously with age; locating which policies may best address this is a necessary step in ensuring the greatest well-being for all.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"~"For its new online publication 'Quality of life indicators', Eurostat is making use of Eurofound's data from the third European Quality of Life Survey."~"EF1361 front.jpg"~5~0
"Sharing solutions for youth employment and social inclusion"~1394466798~1394467736~"<p>While Member States are taking steps to support young people and get them into employment, education or training, youth unemployment is still high (23.4% in the EU28) and young people continue to be at risk of social exclusion and disengagement.

Talking about the <strong>Youth Guarantee</strong> and the Finnish experience, he will mention examples of programmes that worked well and could be transferable to other countries such as enhanced job-search strategies and wage subsidies.</p><p>Bringing together a wide range of international participants, including public authorities and international organisations, representatives of academic and business sectors, EU agencies Cedefop and ETF, and representatives of youth organisations, the aim of the conference is to provide a platform to enable effective learning to aid policy development. Participants will be looking at interventions that have already shown positive results, what role education and training plays, the importance of learning partnerships, good practice in supporting youth transitions and how important active labour market policies are. The objective is to help define solutions to address the NEETs problem and contribute to the development and promotion of a common intervention framework, developing a joint policy response among the represented countries.</p><p>Download Massimiliano Mascherini’s presentation: <a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/docs/spotlight/2014/youth/youthconf_20140310.pdf"">The challenge of NEETs for European societies: Why a public response is needed now?

Discussions there will focus on <strong>social inclusion</strong> of young people, with a particular emphasis on policy actions related to <strong>youth entrepreneurship</strong> and <strong>social entrepreneurship</strong>. The EU Youth Conference is a core part of the structured dialogue process and a forum for continuous joint discussion on the priorities, implementation and follow-up of European cooperation in the youth field.</p><p>The conference, which follows those held under the Irish and Lithuanian Presidencies, is being hosted by the Greek Presidency, in cooperation with the <a href=""http://www.youthforum.org/pressrelease/joint-press-release-eu-youth-conference-kicks-off-in-thessaloniki/"" title=""Read the joint press release for the conference"">European Youth Forum</a> and the European Commission. Alongside representatives from these organisations, around 250 people will participate, representing national youth councils, ministries for youth affairs, candidate countries, countries within the European Free Trade Alliance and international NGOs for youth.</p><p>The conclusions will feed into the drafting of the EU Council Resolution regarding structured dialogue on social inclusion, expected to be adopted by Youth Ministers in May 2014. In addition, part of the results from the conference will contribute to the Council Conclusions on entrepreneurship among young people that are being promoted by the Greek Presidency.</p><p>View the <a href=""http://live.medicaexmachina.gr/gsy201403"">live streaming of the plenary session of the EU Youth Conference</a> on 12 March from 10:00 EET to 12:00 EET.<strong> <br /><br /></strong><br />Follow both debates on Twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/eurofound"">https://twitter.com/eurofound</a>: #NEET, #NEETs, #EU, #youth, #youthguarantee, #EUYouthConf, #gr2014eu, #socialinclusion <br /><br />Read more in <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/youth/resources-eurofound-reports-and-other-information-youth-issues"">Eurofound’s reports on young people and NEETs</a>, including the report on <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1226.htm"">Active inclusion of young people with disabilities or health problems</a>.<br />Also, read the previous Spotlight on Youth article on <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/youth/social-inclusion-of-young-people-in-europe"">Social inclusion of young people in Europe</a>.<br /><em></em></p><p><em>Report coming soon: Mapping youth transitions in Europe<strong><br /></strong></em></p>"~"Two high-profile events take place this week on youth in Europe: One focusing on challenges facing NEETs and one on social inclusion.

"European Policy Centre launches Youth Employment Task Force"~1393591188~1393591188~"<p>The European Policy Centre (EPC) has launched a new <a href=""http://www.epc.eu/prog_forum.php?forum_id=41&amp;prog_id=2"">Youth Employment Task Force</a> that will focus on how to offer better employment prospects to young people in Europe. The EPC describes itself as ‘an independent, not-for-profit think tank, committed to making European integration work’.</p><p>Although the unemployment rate declined slightly in the EU28 overall from December 2012 to 2013, it increased in 14 Member States (including Cyprus, Greece, the Netherlands and Italy), according to Eurostat data. The youth unemployment rate also decreased marginally in the same period from 23.6% to 23.2% in the EU28, but countries like Greece, Spain and Croatia are still showing extremely high levels of approximately 50% or more (fourth quarter 2013). Meanwhile, Eurofound estimates that 14 million young people – 15.4% of the population aged 15–29 – are not in employment, education or training (NEETs).</p><p>However, these unemployment levels are unsustainable and are already having profound economic and social consequences across the EU, as Eurofound research has shown. Member States have been submitting their plans to implement the <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1079&amp;langId=en"">Youth Guarantee</a>, while the Commission urges them to allocate the funding wisely and to ensure any programmes introduced are sustainable for young people and not just crisis measures.</p><h2>Task force mission</h2><p>Against this background, research to be carried out by the EPC task force will focus on two main areas:</p><ul><li>how EU funding has been spent at the regional level (what kind of initiatives and measures have been set up) and whether any conclusions can be drawn with regard to implementing the Youth Guarantee;</li><li>how the education and training system can be better adapted to labour market needs in the long term.</li></ul><p>The first meeting of the task force took place on 18 February in Brussels and the topic of discussion was ‘<a href=""http://www.epc.eu/prog_forum_details.php?cat_id=12&amp;pub_id=4199&amp;prog_id=2&amp;forum_id=41"">The Youth Guarantee Scheme: What can be learned from successful countries?</a>’. Speakers from Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands focused on how the Guarantee is functioning in each country and the challenges encountered. They highlighted that quick intervention, a good quality offer, a strong vocational education scheme, company engagement and strong partnerships are among the essential components. <a href=""http://www.eurociett.eu/index.php?id=15"">Eurociett</a> highlighted how improved cooperation between public and private employment agencies can help create youth employment. The task force will put forward policy recommendations which its members hope will influence policies affecting young people in the short and medium term.</p><h2>NEETs and youth</h2><p>Eurofound has been carrying out research on a range of related topics, such as the issues facing young people who are NEET, the labour market situation of young people, national examples of Youth Guarantee schemes, and active inclusion of young people with disabilities or health problems.

"Less trust all round – Europe in the wake of the crisis"~1391184086~1392227204~"<p><em>‘Divided and unequal societies are not only unjust, they also cannot guarantee stability in the long term’ (Council of Europe)</em></p><p>The effects of the economic crisis continue to be felt across Europe. To get an insight into precisely what those effects are on the lives of Europeans, a new report from Eurofound looks at <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1364.htm"">trends in quality of life</a> over the last decade, using findings from Eurofound’s European Quality of Life survey to gauge both the long-term trends in people’s lives and see what effects the the onset of the crisis in 2008 may have had.</p><p>A key element in people’s quality of life is the society they inhabit – its social relations and institutions. A clear trend that emerges from examining the survey’s findings is that the extent to which people in Europe trust one another has diminished over time – and unevenly across Europe.&nbsp;In 2003, people in the then EU Member States (the EU15) rated the extent to which they trusted other people as 5.8 out of a possible 10; in the countries that were about to enter the EU at the time (the EU12), trust in other people was markedly lower – 4.9. However, in 2007, the gap had almost halved – not because people in the EU12 had become more trusting but because citizens in the EU15 had become much less trusting of others. And in 2011, the gap enlarged again as levels of trust in the EU12 fell by more than those in the EU15.</p><h3>Decrease in trust in other people by country group, 2003–2011</h3><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""1"" style=""width: 461px; height: 63px;""><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>2003</strong></td><td><strong>2007</strong></td><td><strong>2011</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>EU15</strong></td><td>5.80</td><td>5.30</td><td>5.28</td></tr><tr><td><strong>EU12</strong></td><td>4.90</td><td>4.83</td><td>4.62</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In the long term, trust in public institutions is vital for the overall dem&shy;ocratic legitimacy of a system. However, the trust of many Europeans&nbsp;in their political institutions has been shaken since the onset of the crisis. In 2011, people in Europe reported less trust in their parliaments, legal systems, press, police forces and governments than they did in 2007. And for three of these four public institutions – the legal system, police and press – there was a larger fall in trust (and from a lower starting point). &nbsp;</p><h3 class=""MsoNormal"">Changes in trust in public institution by country group, 2007–2011</h3><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""1""><tbody><tr><td></td><td colspan=""2""><p><strong>Trust in parliament</strong></p></td><td colspan=""2""><p><strong>Trust in the legal system</strong></p></td><td colspan=""2""><p><strong>Trust in the press</strong></p></td><td colspan=""2""><p><strong>Trust in police</strong></p></td><td colspan=""2""><p><strong>Trust in government</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2007</td><td>2011</td><td>2007</td><td>2011</td><td>2007</td><td>2011</td><td>2007</td><td>2011</td><td>2007</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td><strong>EU15</strong></td><td>4.90</td><td>4.38</td><td>5.44</td><td>5.08</td><td>4.54</td><td>4.41</td><td>6.31</td><td>6.22</td><td>4.84</td><td>4.16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>EU12</strong></td><td>3.57</td><td>3.06</td><td>4.27</td><td>3.80</td><td>4.92</td><td>4.28</td><td>5.23</td><td>4.95</td><td>3.79</td><td>3.23</td></tr><tr><td><strong>EU27</strong></td><td>4.61</td><td>4.10</td><td>5.20</td><td>4.82</td><td>4.62</td><td>4.39</td><td>6.09</td><td>5.96</td><td>4.62</td><td>3.97</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p>For tensions between different social groups, the report finds a more complex picture. In the EU overall, people perceived less tension in 2011 between different racial and ethnic groups than in 2007 – a declining trend since 2003. Given the extent of migration over recent years, this may appear surprising; however, it may indicate that people are becoming more used to newcomers to their country. The picture is quite different in the EU12 group, however: here people perceive more tension.&nbsp;There is less migration to countries in the EU12, so this may reflect tension between internal racial and ethnic groups (for example, the Roma people).</p><p>For detailed findings on all the aspects of quality of life addressed by the report, <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1364.htm"">download the report from the Eurofound website</a>.</p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p>"~"Europeans have become less trusting, both of their fellow citizens and of their public institutions, in the wake of the economic crisis, as the latest report from the third European Quality of Life Survey makes clear."~"Father - partner and child in background.jpg"~5~0
"How is the Youth Guarantee being rolled out?"~1392027716~1392027957~"<p>Implementing the European <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1079&amp;langId=en"">Youth Guarantee</a> in the EU is a massive challenge for Member States. Government and social partners recognise the need for earlier intervention in preventing youth unemployment, lowering the number of young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs) and adopting a more collaborative approach in tackling the very difficult situation facing Europe’s young people. Action is underway and with youth unemployment declining in some Member States, things appear to be moving in a positive direction.</p><p>It is hoped that the Youth Guarantee will contribute to attaining some of the Europe 2020 objectives: a 75% employment rate of the population aged 20–64; rates of early school-leaving below 10%; and lifting 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion.</p><h2>Current state</h2><p>In April 2013, EU ministers adopted a <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2013:120:0001:0006:EN:PDF"">Council recommendation on establishing a Youth Guarantee (736 KB PDF)</a> with the aim of getting young people under the age of 25 into employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education. Since then, the EU Member States have been finalising their Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans and so far, according to a <a href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-13_en.htm"">press release by the European Commission</a>, 17 countries have submitted plans. These include Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden.</p><p>The Youth Guarantee and other measures to tackle youth unemployment will be co-financed by the European Social Fund (ESF). But those countries with a high number of NEETs and very high youth unemployment – that is, rates in certain areas above 25% – will receive additional support from the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI). This group of 20 countries, which includes Ireland (24.6% youth unemployment), Greece (59.2%), Italy (41.6%), Portugal (36.3%) and Spain (54.3%) (Eurostat, December 2013), was required to submit their implementation plans by the end of 2013. Three were still outstanding by mid January (Slovakia, Slovenia and the UK). The remaining seven Member States not eligible for this funding have until early 2014 to submit plans – Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands.</p><h2>What next?</h2><p>While the Commission assesses the implementation plans already submitted, and provides feedback in due course, Member States are pressing on in preparing their operational programmes. These programmes will specify where each Member States plans to target the ESF and YEI funding over the course of 2014–2020.</p><p>It is obvious that the cost of implementing youth guarantee schemes is huge, but as Eurofound estimates have shown the cost of inaction is much higher, with NEETs estimated to cost the European taxpayer €153 billion a year, not to mention the knock-on cost to individuals and the wider society.</p><p>Member States will look to the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1242.htm"" title=""Read report 'Youth Guarantee: Experiences from Finland and Sweden'"">experiences of youth guarantee schemes in Finland and Sweden</a> which have already been explored by Eurofound research.</p><h2>Youth agenda</h2><p>Continuing the process of dialogue on youth issues and how young people can contribute, a number of recent events have marked the importance of youth issues on the policy agenda. For example, the ‘<a href=""http://40under40.eu/?page_id=1209"">European young leaders: 40 under 40</a>’ group, led by EuropaNova and Friends of Europe, met on 31 January in Brussels to contribute ideas on topics like the role of young voters in European election campaigns, the EU’s impending leadership change and the EU’s energy policy, among others. On 5 February, in the UK, the <a href=""http://www.national-training.com/events/conferences/neet2014/"">8th Annual National NEET Conference 2014</a> focused on how to ‘Engage, enable, empower and employ NEETs’.<br /><br /><em>Coming soon from Eurofound: Mapping youth transitions in Europe&nbsp;</em></p>"~"Read about the state of play of the Youth Guarantee implementation process across EU Member States."~"image001.jpg"~9~0
"Delivering a good life? Examining subjective well-being"~1387128158~1390990231~"<p>Since 2003, Eurofound’s <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/index.htm"">European Quality of Life Survey</a> (EQLS) has asked Europeans how they feel about their lives – how happy and satisfied they are generally, and how they rate particular aspects of their lives, such as their health, the state of their family lives, and the condition of the societies they live in.</p><p>A recently published analysis of the findings of the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/2011/index.htm"">third wave of the survey from 2012</a> seeks to discover what promotes subjective well-being among European citizens, and the risk factors that make it less likely to be realised. The report finds that the key determinants of subjective well-being are freedom from material deprivation, good health, freedom from a limiting disability, a reasonable work–life balance, satisfaction with public services and good social relationships.&nbsp;</p><h2>Policy responses</h2><p>Drawing on this, the report concludes that the well-being of Europeans would benefit from a number of targeted policy responses:</p><ul><li>a focus on efforts to tackle poverty, and a recognition that material deprivation encompasses such elements as being unable to engage in social and leisure activities;</li><li>integrating people with disabilities more fully into society;</li><li>reducing working hours and assisting people achieve a better work–life balance;</li><li>maintaining the quality of public services in the face of austerity – particularly in southern Europe;</li><li>assisting those who are without close support – this might be support around the house, or having someone to talk to, whether facilitated directly by the state or through the non-profit sector.</li></ul><h2>Impact of the crisis</h2><p>Between the second and third waves of the survey – in 2007 and 2012 – Europe entered into a financial &nbsp;crisis that continues to reverberate socially, economically and politically. The report examines the impact that the crisis has had on quality of life in Europe – specifically, how Europeans feel about their lives. It concludes that, overall, well-being has stagnated during the crisis.</p><p>While levels life satisfaction&nbsp;in fact rose slightly between 2007 and 2011, Europeans overall feel less happy,&nbsp;and they also believe that there is more social exclusion than previously.* However, the increase in life satisfaction was experienced only in certain countries and regions, and it was enjoyed by wealthier citizens, in the highest income quartiles; by contrast, the biggest falls in well-being/satisfaction were experienced by people in the lowest income quartile. The report highlights the risk to social cohesion should these trends be allowed to continue unaddressed.&nbsp;</p><p>The full report <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1359.htm"">Quality of life in Europe: Subjective well-being</a> is available online.</p><p><em>* Although they sound similar, the concepts of life satisfaction and happiness are in fact different. 'Life satisfaction' refers to an evaluation of life as a whole; 'happiness' is more emotionally driven and less determined by standard of living.</em></p>"~"A recently published analysis of the findings of the European Quality of Life Survey finds that freedom from material deprivation, good health, work–life balance and good social relationships are among the key determinants of subjective well-being."~"man on cover.png"~5~0
"A retrospective on employment over a decade"~1390380982~1390391862~"<p>The European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) records announcements of large-scale job creation and job destruction arising from restructuring reported in the media across Europe. Its <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1380.htm"" title=""Link the ERM annual report"">annual report</a> for 2013 shows the stark contrast in European fortunes before and after the financial crisis.</p><p><img src=""/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u92/ERM%201%20-%20Jan%2022c.png"" alt=""Line chart showing trends in job loss and job gain as recorded in the ERM database between 2003 and 2013"" title=""Announced job loss and job gained recorded in ERM, 2003–2013"" width=""500"" height=""292"" /></p><p>Job creation surpassed job destruction for a period between 2006 and 2008, but the global financial crisis of 2008 triggered a dramatic reversal. Job loss shot up, while job creation fell steeply. The gap has narrowed since 2010, but job loss has continued to outstrip job creation every quarter to date.</p><h2>Manufacturing slump</h2><p>The three sectors that feature most prominently in job loss figures following the crisis are manufacturing, public administration and defence, and financial services. Even before the crisis, in 2003–2008, manufacturing was the biggest contributor to job loss in the ERM – partly because manufacturing firms tend to be big and are therefore more likely to meet the threshold for inclusion in the ERM database, and partly because manufacturing is declining as a share of the European labour force.</p><p>Job losses in manufacturing after 2008 rose modestly on the pre-crisis period. What really affected the sector badly was the drop in job creation, which was a little more half the figure for 2003–2008. So, across the two periods, net job loss (gross job loss minus gross job gain) in European manufacturing rose from over 200,000 pre-crisis to over 600,000 post-crisis.</p><p><img src=""/spotlight-on/sites/default/files/u92/ERM%202%20-%20Jan%2022c.png"" alt=""Bar chart showing the job loss and gain in five sectors, pre- and post-crisis"" title=""Main sectors of job loss and gain, ERM, 2003–2013"" width=""500"" height=""291"" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" /></p><h2>Public sector declines</h2><p>When job losses in the public administration and defence sector are announced, they usually involve sizeable numbers. The biggest single case in the ERM dataset is the announcement of a cut of 54,000 jobs in military and civilian defence in June 2008 by the French government. Data from the EU Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicate that employment in public administration contracted by 3% between 2008 and 2013, reflecting cuts in public spending as national governments across Europe implemented austerity programmes in response to the crisis.</p><p>The ERM records 33 cases entailing at least 2,000 job losses each since 2008 in the financial services sector. Many of the job cuts in the sector arose from agreements with governments to reduce assets, costs and employment in return for state aid to survive the financial crisis. The ERM includes 18 cases of job loss in the UK banking group Lloyds TSB since April 2009. The bank has shed some 35,000 jobs in the post-crisis period.</p><h2>Retail mixed</h2><p>On the gain side, retail has created one-fifth of new jobs reported in ERM since 2008. That good news is counterbalanced by an increase in the proportion of job loss accounted for by the sector between pre-crisis and post-crisis, from 4% to 8%. Overall, EU LFS data show that employment in retail has shrunk by nearly 3% since 2008.</p><p>This high turnover of jobs in the sector reflects the demise of traditional businesses (such as Woolworths in the UK and Schlecker in Germany) alongside the expansion of retail groups in the low-cost or discount tiers, such as Edeka, Lidl, Tesco and IKEA.</p><p>Online retailing is a growing source of employment; the ERM records over 18,000 jobs created by Amazon since 2011. However, many jobs in online retail are classified under transportation and storage because the work is based in warehouses.</p><p>Other sectors that recorded net job gains in the ERM between 2008 and 2013 included accommodation and food services, professional services such as legal, accounting and engineering, and IT and information services.</p><p>The 2013 ERM annual report analyses these trends in detail, describes the range of ERM outputs and examines changes in offshoring jobs since 2003.</p>"~"The ERM annual report for 2013 shows the contrast in job creation and job loss in Europe between the periods before and after the global financial crisis in Europe."~~6~0
"Better working conditions needed for young workers"~1389268530~1389268530~"<p>Young workers and particularly young labour market entrants (those less than two years in the labour market) across the EU are faced with a particularly difficult employment situation as a result of the crisis. This is evident in the high unemployment rates among young people aged 15–29 and in the relatively high rates of non-standard forms of employment (temporary, part-time, no contract).</p><p>Young workers take up this type of employment as they see it as the only chance of getting their first job or work experience. These are some of the findings of Eurofound’s comparative study on <strong><em>Working conditions of young entrants to the labour market</em></strong>, carried out in the EU27 and Norway.</p><h2>Differences in working conditions</h2><p>As expected, the study finds clear national differences. Some southern and eastern European Member States are experiencing a much more difficult labour market compared with the Nordic and central European countries. Unemployment levels and the perception of job security for young people differ accordingly.</p><p>In addition, there are differences depending on the personal characteristics of young workers (age, education, gender, ethnic origin, family background) and occupational characteristics (economic sectors, occupations, types of enterprises where they work). Female, ‘younger’, lower-qualified and non-native young workers employed in small enterprises are faced with worse employment and working conditions than their male, ‘older’, higher-qualified and native counterparts employed in large enterprises.</p><h2>Negative conditions, possible reasons</h2><p>Young European workers in general and young entrants in particular have:</p><ul><li>more limited levels of autonomy at work;</li><li>more irregular working hour patterns;</li><li>worse payment conditions;</li><li>less access to training opportunities offered by their employers;</li><li>a higher risk of being involved in an accident at work.</li></ul><p>These negative conditions might be explained by:</p><ul><li>the greater presence of fixed-term/temporary contracts among young workers;</li><li>the occupations/economic sectors in which they usually work;</li><li>cautiousness and lack of bargaining power to negotiate their working conditions;</li><li>lack of work-based experience and information.</li></ul><p>Despite the difficult situation many find themselves in, young workers and young entrants appear highly satisfied with the social aspects of their work, particularly contact with and support from colleagues. They are also less concerned about problems reconciling work with private life due to fewer family compromises; this is especially the case among the youngest workers.</p><p>Although the policy debate and initiatives by European institutions, social partners and national authorities have focused on creating jobs for young people, there has not been much emphasis on their working conditions or job quality, apart from examples in the Nordic countries. The report finds, the various partners need to get more involved in the drive to implement Youth Guarantee programmes and to match the skills needs of enterprises to general educational and vocational training schemes.</p><p>Read more in the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/ewco/studies/tn1306013s/index.htm"" title=""Working conditions of young entrants to the labour market"">report and executive summary</a></p>"~"A new Eurofound comparative report highlights the problematic working conditions facing young entrants to the labour market."~"young office workers_crop.jpg"~9~0
"Offshoring – Not a spectre of doom, after all"~1387441797~1387530423~"<p>Offshoring is typically seen as the dark side of globalisation, for developed countries at least, with the leaching of jobs overseas to countries where labour costs are lower. Accumulating research indicates, however, that despite the lure for companies, offshoring is not so great a menace to developed economies as it is made out to be.</p><p>The <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1380.htm"" title=""Link to the ERM annual report"">annual report</a> of the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) finds that fewer than one in ten of all job losses recorded in the ERM database* each year over the past decade went abroad. The level of offshoring halved with the onset of the 2008–2009 recession and has remained low ever since.</p><p>However, loss of jobs to offshoring affected&nbsp;smaller, long-standing Member States to a much greater extent than the EU as a whole. In Denmark, Ireland and Portugal, 17%–18% of jobs lost in restructuring went overseas, compared to 4%–7% in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, and just 1% in Poland and Romania.</p><p>Dispelling another misconception surrounding offshoring, the ERM report notes that the main destination of jobs offshored from EU countries is not China and India (which together account for a quarter), but the newest Member States. These 12 together absorb around one-third of offshored jobs.</p><h2>Business showing caution</h2><p>The report reasons that the main cause of the recent slackening off is likely to be a reluctance among companies to make a major investment in moving business processes abroad during a period of economic uncertainty. But since it appears to be pro-cyclical, a return to economic growth could see a resurgence in offshoring.</p><p>One US-based analysis estimates that, in principle, in or around a quarter of jobs in the US could be offshored – a figure equally applicable to the EU. And there is broad agreement among researchers on the subject that jobs requiring higher, not lower, levels of education are at potentially greater risk of offshoring.</p><h2>Future trends</h2><p>This means that the character of offshoring in the future is likely to be different from its current guise. To date, it has affected mostly low-skilled jobs in developed countries; in the future, is likely to affect jobs in higher occupational groups, requiring higher education levels with above-median pay levels.</p><p>* The ERM database is a record of large-scale restructurings in the EU and Norway announced in the media. At present, it is the only European data source that enables estimates to be made of how much of large-scale restructuring job loss is accounted for by offshoring.</p>"~"Research shows that a small proportion of the jobs lost over the past decade as a result of companies restructuring has gone overseas.

"Temporary work among young people on the increase"~1387304160~1387304160~"<p>The crisis has hit young workers particularly hard, both in terms of job losses and job security for those still at work. Since 2008, employment rates of young people across the EU have been sharply falling while unemployment rates have been rising. By mid-2013, unemployment among people aged 15–24 reached over 23%. Many of the workers in this age group are employed on temporary work contracts (42% versus 10% of workers aged 25–64). Although these young temporary workers were often the first to lose their jobs at the onset of the recession as their contracts were not renewed, their relative number is on the increase again.</p><p>Eurofound’s report on <em><strong>Young people and temporary employment in Europe</strong></em> looks at the reasons for temporary employment growth in the EU and Norway, access to social protection for young people on such contracts and measures in various countries to regulate the use of temporary contracts.</p><h2>Extent of temporary employment</h2><p>From 2009, with most EU economies in recession, many employers were reluctant to take people on in permanent jobs during a period of economic uncertainty. As a result, large numbers of the young people recruited went into fixed-term jobs and the overall proportion of the workforce employed on such contracts increased, particularly in the direction of traineeships and probationary periods. The number of young people in work who had temporary contracts rose in 20 of the 28 countries studied, particularly in countries majorly affected by the crisis – Ireland, Italy, Slovenia and Spain.</p><p>To stimulate job creation, a number of governments have relaxed restrictions on the use of fixed-term contracts. Although temporary or fixed-term contracts can be a stepping stone for young people in their transition from education into work, they can also trap young people in insecure jobs. This has particularly been the case during the crisis, as employers have been trying to adjust their workforce in line with demand and have been reluctant to offer permanent jobs in order to keep costs down.</p><h2>Social protection issues</h2><p>With a few exceptions, young people on temporary contracts in principle have the same entitlement to social protection as workers on standard contracts. In practice, however, the fact that their employment is short-term means that they often lack adequate contributions to qualify for income support, such as unemployment, sickness and maternity benefits.</p><p>Self-employed workers in most countries have less entitlement to social benefits than employees, mainly because paying contributions is voluntary. In particular, the young self-employed on low pay are less likely to make contributions due to the extra cost involved.</p><p>Regarding healthcare, however, young temporary workers in all countries (except Poland) have the same access as permanent workers.</p><p>To improve the situation of young workers, governments need to monitor any growth of self-employment and to verify that it is legitimate. There is also a need to ensure that young self-employed workers have adequate income support if their contract ends or they fall ill.</p><h2>Moving into permanent employment</h2><p>Although temporary contracts such as traineeships or probationary periods may put young people on a path towards more permanent jobs, the number of those making the transition to permanent employment has declined in the crisis period.</p><p>Measures taken across the EU to create employment among young people – such as government- funded work experience programmes and employer subsidies to take on young workers – are some of the reasons for the growth in temporary work.</p><p>Yet young people on temporary contracts have not been a major policy concern for the social partners, due to the demands of the crisis. While employers welcome the flexibility of temporary contracts, trade unions are concerned about the insecurity of such contracts.</p><p>However, in its June 2013 Communication ‘Working together for Europe’s young people – a call to action on youth unemployment’, the European Commission highlighted that increasing job opportunities for young people is a priority but should not be done at a cost of lower job quality and increased levels of insecurity. It is hoped that the Youth Guarantee will help to improve the quality of jobs for young people, leading to more sustainable employment in the future.</p><p>Read more in the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/studies/tn1304017s/index.htm"" title=""Read the report: Young people and temporary employment in Europe"">report and executive summary</a></p><p>Report coming in 2014: <em>Mapping youth transitions in Europe </em></p><p></p>"~"Read about the findings of Eurofound’s comparative study on young people and temporary employment.

"Is skills deficiency causing high unemployment?"~1386587048~1386594365~"<p>The <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1386.htm"" title=""European Company Survey résumé"">first results</a> from Eurofound’s European Company Survey (ECS) 2013 include the finding that 4 out of 10 establishments in the European Union have difficulty recruiting employees with the right skills. So, despite an unprecedented level of unemployment in the EU, it seems that neither workers who have become unemployed nor young workers entering the labour market are the workers that employers are seeking.</p><h2>Cyclical or structural?</h2><p>The finding is interesting in light of the view among some economists that there has been a fundamental shift in the nature of the labour market, with the effect that much of current unemployment is structural rather than temporary (or cyclical). It means that the economy is failing to match workers to jobs. One typical contributor to structural unemployment is a mismatch between the skills employers are looking for and the skills that workers have to offer.</p><p>Structural unemployment implies that high unemployment will persist even when the economy recovers – a jobless recovery. If unemployment is cyclical in nature, however, demand for labour is weak as a whole and sluggish economic conditions are a major factor behind the unemployment rate. It follows that employment improves once the economy recovers.</p><p>Disentangling cyclical and structural unemployment is important because they demand different policy responses. Cyclical unemployment suggests policies be directed at stimulating demand, whereas structural unemployment demands measures to tackle poor matching, such as reskilling workers or developing more effective public employment services to improve the interface between job-seekers and employers.</p><p>The European Commission in the <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2013/ee6_en.htm"" title=""Labour market developments in Europe 2013 report"">Labour market developments in Europe 2013</a> report, published in October,&nbsp;concludes that cyclical unemployment is substantial in most EU countries. It notes that construction and industry were the two sectors that were most heavily hit by unemployment during the crisis. However, since 2011 there has been a rapid reduction in the proportion of unemployed people who were previously employed in these sectors.</p><h2>Labour market mismatching</h2><p>Nevertheless, the report identifies a rise in structural unemployment in several countries. It finds that since 2000, labour market matching has worsened in the euro zone countries that were most severely affected by the economic crisis, as well as in the Baltic states, Hungary, Sweden and the UK; by contrast, matching has improved in Germany. The analysis also shows that skills mismatches persist among unskilled workers and workers who lost jobs in retail and the public sector</p><p>Findings from <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/ecs/index.htm"" title=""ECS home page"">three waves of the ECS</a> are consistent with the Commission's analysis. The ECS has found evidence that skills mismatches are an enduring and increasing problem in the EU. When Eurofound conducted its first survey in 2004–2005, 35% of establishments reported difficulty recruiting employees with the right skills. The figure rose to 37% in 2009, and by a further 2 percentage points to 39% in 2013.</p><p>Targeted education and training policies need to be considered to reduce labour market mismatches, to reskill unemployed workers, to support job-seekers in the process of job-seeking, and to prevent long-term unemployment from transforming into permanent alienation from the workforce.</p><p></p>"~"Data from the European Company Survey 2013 raise questions over whether there is a fundamental mismatch between workers’ skills and employers’ needs.

"Is the European Youth Guarantee becoming a reality?"~1386241535~1386242297~"<p>Now that EU funding has been pledged to allow Member States to start implementing Youth Guarantee schemes, attention turns to how this will be done in practice. The Commission is offering support and guidance to the Member States, but national governments must submit Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans before the end of 2013, with roll-out to begin on 1 January 2014.</p><p>To look at the situation in those countries with great difficulties as a result of the recession and high unemployment, Eurofound organised a seminar on ‘<strong>The European Youth Guarantee – From concept to reality</strong>’ in Madrid on 28 November. Held at the Spanish Economic and Social Council (CES), the event brought together representatives of public authorities, workers, employers and youth organisations from Member States particularly affected by youth unemployment: Ireland (28%), Italy (40.4%), Portugal (36.9%) and Spain (56.5%) (Eurostat, September 2013). The discussion focused on the challenges faced by these countries in tackling the high youth unemployment as a result of the crisis and also in implementing the Youth Guarantee.</p><h2>Setting the scene</h2><p>Marcos Peña, President of the CES, opened the proceedings, stating that it is impossible to change reality if we don’t understand it and encouraged participants to debate and discuss the issues. Juan Menéndez-Valdés, Eurofound Director, highlighted the huge social and economic costs of the crisis and unemployment, drawing attention to the staggering number of young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs), and stressing the urgency to act at EU and national levels.</p><p>Setting the scene for discussion and debate, presentations followed by Eurofound representatives on ‘Living and working in Europe’ and ‘A Youth Guarantee: The Nordic concept’, highlighting the difficult unemployment situation in Europe, the situation of NEET young people, particularly in the four countries mentioned, as well as giving positive examples of youth guarantees from the Nordic countries. Max Uebe from the European Commission presented ‘A roadmap for Member States’ in implementing the Youth Guarantee (<a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/events/2013/youthguarantee/index.htm"">view programme and all three presentations</a>).</p><p>Under the Youth Employment Initiative, €6 billion will be made available to Member States in 2014–2015 to start implementing Youth Guarantee schemes, with additional funding to follow. This would be complementary to other projects undertaken at national level, including those with support from the <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/esf/home.jsp?langId=en"">European Social Fund</a> (ESF). Mr Uebe emphasised that the Youth Guarantee should not be seen as a short-term measure but as a ‘living plan’ and encouraged Member States to spend the allocated money wisely on sustainable, tailor-made programmes and to ensure good quality offers of jobs. José María Goerlich Peset then chaired the Q&amp;A session with lively participation from representatives of governments, trade unions, employers and youth organisations.</p><h2>Challenges of implementation</h2><p>This first panel discussion focused on how to manage the varying needs of the different groups of young people looking for work and how to match the right person to the right job. It also sought ways to move forward on youth employment when jobs are not available.</p><p>Speakers gave an overview of the difficult economic situation in their respective countries, mentioning in particular high youth unemployment, the high NEETs rate, the impact of low education and the efforts to reach out to those furthest from the labour market, such as better profiling of individual jobseekers. For example, one measure in Ireland called ‘Intreo’ aims to create a one-stop-shop for active and passive support measures.</p><p>The speakers also said that the role of the public employment services needs to be strengthened, and that matching skills to labour market needs is necessary and that of course economic growth is crucial also in creating employment. They recognised the need for earlier intervention and a more collaborative approach.</p><h2>Opportunities and synergies</h2><p>Panellists in the second session explored how to reach out to young people in implementing the Youth Guarantee, providing some real life examples of good traineeships and looking at how to ensure quality in traineeships.<br />Speakers again outlined the situation facing young people in each country, highlighting the impact of austerity measures and the huge challenge of implementing the Youth Guarantee. But they recognised the opportunities for synergies and the potential of the youth sector and youth organisations in helping to address the unemployment challenge and reach out to marginalised groups.</p><p>It is important to recognise the link between youth work and employability, the need to offer quality jobs, the need to raise the level of training for young people, and the importance of preventing high-school dropouts and encouraging social inclusion. In Portugal, for instance, there is a need to reinforce links between the private and public sector to create opportunities for young people.</p><p>The European Youth Forum highlighted the potential of non-formal education and the need to recognise pre-existing skills of young people who are outside the labour market. All countries were concerned over the funding method for implementing the Youth Guarantee, whereby governments have to match the funding available to them from the ESF.</p><p><strong>Closing remarks</strong> were from Miguel Ángel García Martín, Director General for Self-Employment, Social Economy and Corporate Social Responsibility at the Spanish Ministry of Employment and Social Security. Among the structural weak points that national governments need to address, he said, are the high rate of early school-leavers, training people in trades, language skills of young people, entrepreneurship and polarisation of the labour market.</p><h2>Youth Intergroup brings young MPs together</h2><p>The discussion on youth employment strategies continues in Brussels on 5 December at the first European forum of young members of national and European parliaments, organised by the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Youth-Intergroup-of-the-European-Parliament/182628841757687"">Youth Intergroup of the European Parliament</a>.

"Youth Guarantee: EU leaders intensify efforts to tackle youth unemployment"~1385459406~1385460161~"<p>On 8 November, the European Commission published a memo on ‘EU measures to tackle youth unemployment’, quoting findings from Eurofound research on <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1254.htm"" title=""See report: NEETs - Young people not in employment, education or training: Characteristics, costs and policy responses in Europe"">young people not in employment, education or training (NEET)</a>. It drew attention to the difficult situation facing young people and the high number of young Europeans (7.5 million) aged 15–24 who fall into the NEET category.</p><h2>€45 billion funding</h2><p>A group of 24 European leaders subsequently met in Paris on 12 November and agreed to mobilise €45 billion in an intensified effort to fight youth unemployment through the EU Youth Guarantee and other measures (see <a href=""http://www.euractiv.com/socialeurope/EU-leaders-intensify-pledges-youth-unemployment-news-531660"">EurActiv video</a>). According to Eurostat, in September 2013, the youth unemployment rate was 23.5% in the EU28, accounting for almost 5.6 million young people aged under 25 who are out of work. The aim of the funding is to reverse these rising unemployment figures over the next few years. Eurofound research highlights the high cost of this unemployment (€153 billion annually) and that investing in young people pays off.</p><p>Previously, the EU pledged €6 billion but this amount does not seem enough to achieve implementation of the Youth Guarantee. Therefore, €7 billion more per year will be added from the European Social Fund (ESF) and €6 billion from the European Investment Bank. This brings the total to about €45 billion to be spent on tackling youth unemployment between 2013 and 2015. The funding will commence on 1 January 2014 for those countries with plans in place to implement the Youth Guarantee.</p><h2>Youth Guarantee actions</h2><p>Under the Youth Guarantee, there are initiatives aimed at improving the entry rate of young people to the labour market. First, via training and traineeships, EU leaders have agreed to intensity efforts to ensure that young people receive the necessary qualifications to meet future labour market needs. Second, they aim to integrate into the world of work those young people who are in the greatest difficulties and furthest from the labour market. Third, they want to encourage young people to create jobs for themselves, which may require some policy change.</p><p>On 28 November, Eurofound hosts a seminar on ‘<a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/events/2013/youthguarantee/index.htm"">The European Youth Guarantee – From concept to reality</a>’ in Madrid. With the support of the Spanish Economic and Social Council, the event will bring together representatives of public authorities, workers, employers and youth organisations from Member States particularly affected by youth unemployment: Ireland (28%), Italy (40.4%), Portugal (36.9%) and Spain (56.5%) (Eurostat, September 2013). The discussion will focus on the challenges faced by these countries in tackling the high youth unemployment as a result of the crisis and also in implementing the Youth Guarantee.</p><h2>Current research</h2><p>Eurofound is monitoring the situation facing young people across Europe, particularly NEETs, and has also been researching the working conditions of young entrants to the labour market, as well as their labour market transitions.

"Postal services in flux after deregulation"~1383899309~1383900695~"<p>National postal services across Europe have been cutting their workforces as they restructure operations to cope with full liberalisation of the EU market. In July, for example, Romania’s national postal service Posta Romana announced plans to cut its workforce of 33,000 by 3,650. Hungary’s Magyar Posta shed 875 jobs in the first quarter of 2013 through a process of mutual agreement with employees.</p><p>Both countries are in the group of 11 Member States that were permitted to postpone liberalisation for two years until 2013; the other 16 Member States opened their markets by the end of 2010.</p><p>Postal services in this latter group are suffering too, however; Italy’s Poste Italiane last year cut 1,000 jobs with the closure of 83 branches in Lombardy. This is part of a country-wide restructuring plan, yet to be rolled out, that trade unions say will see the loss of 10,000 jobs.</p><h2>Private sector optimism</h2><p>Meanwhile, private postal services are taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the single postal market and expanding operations. In September, Dutch company TNT Post announced it would create 1,000 new jobs as part of its UK&nbsp;rollout of services in Manchester, and Total Post, a young Romanian company, created 180 jobs earlier in the year to support the expansion of its network.</p><p>The latest <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1390.htm"" title=""Link to ERM quarterly"">ERM quarterly</a> examines recent restructuring in the postal sector.

It reports that the manufacturing sector saw the greatest number of job gains and job losses during the third quarter of this year, although losses were greater than gains.</p><p>Employment is forecast to continue falling in the EU; however, the quarterly notes that employers’ hiring intentions appear to be improving in some sectors, such as manufacturing, services and construction.</p>"~"Restructuring is causing job cuts in national postal monopolies in the wake of liberalisation, and private operators are making gains at their expense."~"P0115550009H.jpg"~6~0
"In-depth reports explore quality of life "~1383810953~1383841135~"<p>A new series of reports from Eurofound – launched on 7 November – looks in detail at a range of aspects of quality of life and the changes in these that have taken place as a result of the crisis. Three of the reports analyse findings from the third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), conducted in 2011–2012, and compare them with findings from the 2007 wave; they address the themes of subjective well-being, quality of society and public services, and social inequalities.</p><h2 class=""MsoNormal"">Bearing up?</h2><p class=""MsoNormal"">Some aspects of life and society in Europe have deteriorated, and more so for certain groups:&nbsp;the extent of material deprivation rose between 2007 and 2011, particularly for people with a limiting disability or health condition, the long-term unemployed and people aged between 50 and 64 years. Other aspects of society have weathered the storm: encouragingly, levels of trust in other people remain largely unchanged.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Taking an in-depth look at the survey data reveals some surprising findings: it emerges that harsh though material deprivation may be, it is the social aspects of such deprivation – not being able to invite guests over for dinner, for instance –&nbsp;that weigh &nbsp;most heavily on people. And, given the pressure that economic circumstances can place upon people to move region or country in search of work, it is sobering to learn that while face-to-face contact with friends strongly improves well-being (as might be expected), indirect contact – on the phone or by email – has almost no positive impact.</p><h2 class=""MsoNormal"">Debts and trust&nbsp;</h2><p class=""MsoNormal"">The package of publications also contains two policy briefs; these use EQLS findings to explore policy options in the areas of the burden of informal debts in over-indebted households, and of political trust and civic engagement.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The first policy brief points out that much of the policy debate on over-indebtedness has focused on formal debts such as arrears on utility bills, rents or&nbsp;mortgages. However, when they urgently need money, most people in the EU say they would turn to relatives or friends.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Problems may arise in making payments related to these informal debts as well as to formal debts. Moreover, what may appear to be limited problems in formal debt arrears may mask more substantial informal arrears.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The second brief makes clear that, in most countries, trust in both national and European political institutions has eroded substantially since the onset of the economic crisis. Among EU residents trust in the EU used to stand at a considerably higher level than trust in their own national governments or parliaments, but this ‘surplus’ of trust has diminished in recent years. <o:p></o:p></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 11.35pt;"" class=""EFNewsparagraph"">Visit the Eurofound website to access <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/2011/secondaryanalysis.htm"" title=""Link to package of reports on quality of life"">the five reports</a>.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p><h2 style=""margin-bottom: 11.35pt;"" class=""EFNewsparagraph"">OECD How's Life?</h2><p style=""margin-bottom: 11.35pt;"" class=""EFNewsparagraph"">Also this week, the OECD published the report <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/statistics/howslife.htm""><em>How's Life? 2013: Measuring well-being</em></a>.

His key reason for coming back into the workforce is to support his three adult children, who are coping with unemployment, eviction and post-divorce financial problems. However, he also enjoys the work, and says, ‘I live for my clients, contacts with other people and smiles of people ... I will die if I stop.’ &nbsp;Despite this, however, complex and unclear regulation can be a barrier to work after retirement: the deli operator does not know if this new income will affect his monthly pension of €900 per month.&nbsp;</p><h2>Need to work, or want to work?</h2><p>The numbers of people who are over official retirement age and yet working are increasing – rapidly – in the EU. The employment rate for people aged 65–69 rose from 8.4% in 2004 to 11.1% in 2013. The example above indicates some of the key motivations for older citizens pursuing employment in what has been traditionally seen as a time for leisure after a lifetime’s work.</p><p>Approximately two-fifths of people aged between 65 and 80 years who work do so purely because of financial need. For the majority, however, work is pursued for the contacts with colleagues and clients it offers, and for the opportunity to learn and contribute.</p><h2>Barriers to getting back to work</h2><p>The complexity of the picture of older working Europeans was highlighted by Eurofound research officer Hans Dubois at the recent <a href=""http://www.ageing-forum.org/en/programm/"" title=""Link to conference programme"">2013 National Conference on Ageing in Moscow</a>. Retirees run the risk that they may not benefit financially from working, where pensions are income dependent.</p><p>Even where policy and legislation changes to make it easier for people to work after the age of 65, this may not be effective. In Denmark, for instance, a 2008 change in the law, which allowed retirees to earn up to a certain amount per year with no impact on their pensions, had little impact on employment rates – partly because many retirees did not know about it.&nbsp;</p><p>While retirees may experience difficulties in re-entering the labour market, many employers are seeing the benefits of employing them. Employers are attracted by the loyalty they observe among post-retirement workers, their high levels of motivation and their willingness to be flexible.</p><p>In addition, companies want to have workforces that reflect the broader society – which has an ever-larger proportion of retirees. Millions of Europeans past retirement age are already working; in an environment where people are living longer, and concerns are growing about whether pensions can be both adequate and sustainable, retirement practices created for a different set of circumstances may need to be updated to match this new reality.</p><p>More of Eurofound's <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/populationandsociety/incomeafteretirement.htm"" title=""Eurofound's web page on income from work after retirement"">work on this area is available online</a>, and the presentation given in Moscow <a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/docs/spotlight/2013/qualityoflife/ageingconf_20131010.pdf"" title=""Link to conference presentation"">can be viewed in PDF format</a>.</p>"~~"FF12 page12.jpg"~5~0
"Focusing on the impact of the crisis"~1382701569~1382701573~"<p>The economic crisis has profoundly changed the quality of life of Europeans – changes described in the latest issue of Eurofound’s magazine Foundation Focus.&nbsp;</p><p>A comparison of the findings from the second and third waves of the European Quality of Life Survey in 2007 and 2011 – as documented in the Focus – reveals the extent of the impact of the crisis and of disparities in quality of life both across the continent and between social groups. Europeans are finding it harder to make ends meet, particularly those who have had to cope with pay cuts or unemployment.</p><p>Many European residents, particularly those who are already suffering disadvantage, experienced a worsening of their health in the years between 2007 and 2011. In particular, the indicators for poor mental health are notably worse among Europe’s young people, who are especially affected by unemployment. However, elderly people suffer their own forms of disadvantage, being much more likely to lack sources of social support than younger Europeans.</p><h2>Rating public services</h2><p><span>Public services, such as healthcare, are an important component of overall quality of life, and in times of difficulty they can support and protect citizens. But sharp cuts in government finances have affected many countries’ ability to provide services at the levels required or expected. </span></p><p><span>Substantial differences emerge between Member States in terms of their residents’ rating of the quality of public services in 2011, and in terms of how that rating has changed since 2007. In a number of countries residents rate public services in the aggregate as being better than the EU average, and give them a higher rating than in 2007 – Austria, Germany, Luxembourg and the UK. (Also included in this group is Spain, despite the economic difficulties it has faced since 2008). </span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, for a large group of countries – 17 in all – ratings for services in 2011 are worse than they were in 2007; of these, 11 have poorer ratings than the EU27 average. Notably, this group comprises 9 of the 10 eastern European Member States (together with Ireland and Greece).&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Restricted expenditure</h2><p>This issue of Foundation Focus also includes an interview with John Halloran of the <a href=""http://www.esn-eu.org/home/index.html"">European Social Network</a> who sets out his ideas for building the foundations for a new welfare state in Europe, and who warns ‘This situation of restricted expenditure is permanent’. Findings on best practice in household debt-assistance services are outlined, as are quality of life findings for Croatia, Europe’s newest Member State.</p><p>This issue also looks at the challenges that arise from juggling care tasks with employment, the effect of austerity measures on the delivery of public services at the national level, and the impact of the crisis on working conditions and social dialogue in central public administration.</p><p>Download <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1342.htm"" title=""Link to online publication"">Foundation Focus: Quality of life, public services and the crisis</a> from the Eurofound website.</p>"~~"infographic 1.png"~5~0
"Mental health of young people a priority"~1381741715~1381741715~"<p>Addressing the issue of mental health among young people has become a priority for the EU. Eurofound participated again in the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/presidencies/index.htm"" title=""Read about Eurofound and the Lithuanian Presidency"">Lithuanian Presidency</a> events on 10–11 October by joining the debate at the conference on ‘<a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/174877398/Presidency-Conference-Mental-Health-Challenges-and-Possibilities"" title=""Read the agenda"">Mental health: Challenges and possibilities</a>’ in Vilnius, organised in cooperation with the State Mental Health Centre.</p><p>Speakers at the conference emphasised the importance of mental health in all policies, and society’s influence on the emergence and development of mental illness. Keeping young people in Europe on the policy agenda, part of the debate centred on children’s and adolescents’ mental health development, and the analysis of addictive disorders.</p><p>The 200 participants at the event included mental health experts from around the EU, the candidate countries and the European Free Trade Association. Representatives from the European Commission and the World Health Organization (WHO), plus experts and academics from Lithuania and beyond addressed the conference.</p><p>Topics covered in the debate included preventing mental illness in children and adolescents through child-friendly health systems, promoting good mental health and well-being in educational systems, and preventing cycles of violence by addressing both risk and protective factors.</p><h2>Intervention and social inclusion measures</h2><p>Representing Eurofound at the event were Research Managers from the Living Conditions and Quality of Life Unit, Tadas Leončikas and Anna Ludwinek.</p><p>Coinciding with World Mental Health Day, Mr Leončikas presented to the plenary session on 10 October on <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/docs/events/2013/mentalhealthvilnius/tle_pres.pdf"">Mainstreaming mental well-being in policies of all levels (385 KB PDF)</a>. After presenting Eurofound survey findings on health and well-being, he spoke about the policy implications for coordinated action in monitoring, prevention and early intervention.</p><p>Speaking about early intervention in particular, he highlighted findings from Eurofound’s study on <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1226.htm"" title=""Read the report"">Active inclusion of young people with disabilities or health problems</a>. He argued that joint action and coordination between local authorities, social partners, employment services and NGOs are vital in early intervention measures. In many countries, funding of NGOs plays a role in this as a large part of the service for young people is supplied by these organisations.</p><h2>Lack of focus</h2><p>The active inclusion report highlighted a lack of specific focus on young people with disabilities at EU and national policy level. Yet there is evidence that much of the rise in the numbers of young people entering the disability registers is due to mental health problems.</p><p>It shows that the services and supports associated with active inclusion include good quality mental health services and social inclusion services to help young people with disabilities or mental health problems enter the labour market.</p><p>Moreover, the report suggests that addressing issues such as stigma, prejudice and lack of awareness among mainstream service suppliers, employers, potential fellow employees and society at large is key to enabling effective active inclusion policies for young people with mental health problems.</p><h2>NEET factors</h2><p>Another report by Eurofound on <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1254.htm"" title=""See report: NEETs - Young people not in employment, education or training: Characteristics, costs and policy responses in Europe"">Young people not in employment, education or training (NEETs)</a> shows that poor physical or mental health, disability, unemployment and inactivity are among the factors particularly associated with being NEET. The report highlights that those who begin to practise active citizenship and volunteering during childhood and adolescence are more likely to have a stable pattern of civic engagement, which enables a sense of connection to others. This also helps to prevent social exclusion as it allows young people to form social networks, build social capital and connect to educational and occupational opportunities.</p><p>Read more <a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/youth/resources-eurofound-reports-and-other-information-youth-issues"">Eurofound research on the situation of young people in Europe</a>.</p>"~"Eurofound joined the debate on mental health, the challenges and possibilities at the Lithuanian Presidency conference in Vilnius on 10–11 October 2013."~"ef1226 cover image cropped.jpg"~9~0
"Is its social model holding Europe back? "~1380229200~1380283096~"<p>The viability of the European Social Model, a cornerstone of the European project, has been repeatedly questioned in light of the ‘new reality’ of a global economy, and never more so than now. In the context of record unemployment, ‘any job is better than no job’ is intoned against the ambition of better jobs. The commitment to job quality, so the argument goes, must be sacrificed if Europe is to tackle its now-chronic unemployment rates and remain competitive against its global rivals.</p><h2>Social and competitive Europe</h2><p>But the argument isn’t borne up by the evidence. Countries with the highest labour market participation – the Nordic countries, Austria and Germany – are also those with those with highest rates of high-quality employment <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1228.htm"" title=""Link to Trends in job quality in Europe report"">according to Eurofound research</a>. They are also among the top countries in the World Economic Forum’s <a href=""http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2013-2014"" title=""Link to World Economic Forum report on global competitiveness 2013-2014"">global competitiveness ranking</a>.</p><p>Criticisms of strong social protection systems and generous public support for education would also seem to be misplaced. Active labour market policies, including youth guarantees, which have been pioneered by the Nordic countries, have contributed to the resilience of their labour markets in the face of the crisis. Germany’s dual vocational and education system has been fundamental to getting its young people into work and keeping down youth unemployment, while its culture of social dialogue has helped to preserve jobs during the crisis.</p><h2>Meeting current challenges</h2><p>Eurofound’s Director Juan Menéndez-Valdéz this week argued that countries that have successfully combined competitiveness with robust social supports have done so by adapting the social model to the challenges they face. So the question is how to adapt the social model to current needs rather than abandoning it. He was speaking at a meeting of four EU agencies (Eurofound, Cedefop, EU-OSHA and the ETF) on strengthening the European Social Model to support competitiveness.</p><p>EU Commissioner László Andor underlined the need to reconstruct the European Social Model in the context of greater integration of Member States: ‘solidarity within Member States can only be strengthened if solidarity between the Member States is boosted significantly’. While he acknowledged that repairing the European Monetary Union is a priority, he also underlined the need to ‘ensure that the functioning of the monetary union does not contradict the social objectives all EU Member States share’.</p><p>The <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1228.htm"" title=""Link to speeches and presentations from the four agencies seminar"">speeches and presentations</a> from the event are available on the Eurofound website.</p>"~"Predictions of the demise of the European Social Model are premature, as the evidence indicates that there is no inevitable trade-off between a competitive economy and an inclusive society."~"4agencies3.jpg"~6~0
"Employment of marginalised youth – Time to invest and innovate"~1379592129~1379931049~"<p>Eurofound was represented at the national conference on ‘<a href=""https://etouches.com/ehome/index.php?eventid=57930&amp;"">Investing in youth employment</a>’ in Sydney on 19–20 September, organised by <a href=""https://yfoundations.org.au/"">Yfoundations</a>, Australia’s main youth homelessness organisation. The event brought together business leaders, government decision-makers and representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), social partners and education providers to discuss ways to increase the employment of marginalised youth.</p><p>On 19 September the Head of Eurofound’s Living Conditions and Quality of Life Unit, Rob Anderson, presented findings of recent Eurofound research on issues affecting young people across Europe, particularly marginalised youth. Participants at the conference discussed school-to-work transitions, well-being for young people at work, engaging young people in training and what employers want.</p><p>His presentation emphasised that the main debate in the EU has centred on unemployment among young people (at 23% of 15–24 year-olds in the EU), the risks of that unemployment and the knock-on effects, particularly for marginalised groups such as those described below.</p><h2>NEETs</h2><p>One key group of marginalised youth are those young people who are not in employment, education or training (NEET). The size of the NEET population across Europe (7.5 million aged 15–24) has led to a renewed sense of urgency to understand and deal with the problem. Eurofound’s report <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1254.htm"" title=""Read the report 'NEETs – Young people not in employment, education or training: Characteristics, costs and policy responses in Europe'"">Young people not in employment, education or training</a> shows that certain categories of young people are at higher risk of becoming NEET: for example, those with a low level of education, with an immigration background or with a disability. Mr Anderson indicated that the main challenge at EU level has been designing and implementing measures to reintegrate these young people into the labour market.</p><h2>Young people with disabilities</h2><p>Another marginalised group is made up of young people with health problems or disabilities. According to the Eurofound study on <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1226.htm"">Active inclusion of young people with disabilities or health problems</a>, an integrated approach from local authorities, social partners, employers and NGOs is essential for the inclusion of vulnerable young people, particularly in creating measures that are flexible to meet differing needs. This includes skills development, training and job placement, thus empowering individuals to take control of their own career paths. Employers also need support with recruitment, training and retention of young people with disabilities.</p><h2>Innovation in EU countries</h2><p>As the conference looked for innovations in the area of youth employment, Mr Anderson presented some positive examples of social innovation in various EU Member States, drawing on the report <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1354.htm"">Social innovation in service delivery: New partners and approaches</a>. This report looks at new relationships and roles for social partners, local government and youth NGOs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Anderson’s presentation concluded by highlighting policy responses taken at EU level. He spoke about the adoption of the <a href=""http://www.consilium.europa.eu/homepage/highlights/council-agrees-on-youth-guarantee?lang=en"">Youth Guarantee</a> in April 2013 and looked at its strengths and weaknesses as it aims to ensure that ‘young people up to age 25 receive offer of a job, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of leaving education or becoming unemployed’.</p><p class=""highlighted"">Download his presentation: <a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/docs/spotlight/2013/youth/youthsydney_20130919.pdf"">Youth employment in times of crisis: International innovations promoting youth employment (657 KB PDF</a>)</p><p class=""highlighted"">Listen to his <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-20/european-youth-dubbed-generation-jobless/4972520"" title=""Interview focusing on European youth dubbed 'generation jobless'"">interview with ABC News </a></p><p>See also the earlier related spotlight on youth posts:</p><ul><li><a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/youth/social-inclusion-of-young-people-in-europe"">Social inclusion of young people in Europe</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/spotlight-on/youth/supporting-young-people-through-social-innovation-and-investment"">Supporting young people through social innovation and investment</a></li></ul>"~"Eurofound is participating at the national conference on ‘Investing in youth employment’ on 19–20 September in Sydney, presenting research findings on NEETs, young people with disabilities and social innovation.

"Home-care services will be a major job creator"~1379658076~1379665757~"<p>The long-term care sector is a growing source of jobs. Rising numbers of older people, and longer lifespans, alongside the declining availability of family care providers are increasing the demand for paid care.</p><p>The size of the long-term care workforce is expected to double by 2050. However, the sector is generally characterised by difficult working conditions – low pay, demanding work, irregular working time and poor career prospects – which means it struggles to attract new recruits and retain its existing workforce.</p><p><a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/labourmarket/home-care.htm?utm_source=website_item1&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=homecareservices20130912"" title=""More and better jobs web page"">Research findings</a> just launched by Eurofound propose a number of strategies to avert future staff shortages in home-care services – services that support older people and those with disabilities or chronic illnesses to live independently in their homes.</p><p>Based on case studies of successful initiatives across Europe, the research report suggests that job quality can be improved by professionalising the sector by providing opportunities for professional development, improving career paths and making training more accessible.</p><h2>Precarious work</h2><p>There is slim evidence at present of efforts being made to address working conditions in the sector. According to Kai Leichsenring, a researcher at the <a href=""http://www.euro.centre.org/"" title=""Link to home page of the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research"">European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research</a>, who spoke at the launch, there is ‘more a “race to the bottom” rather than improvements in working conditions’ in the context of the current crisis.</p><p>He noted that new forms of precarious work with even lower pay and fewer social rights are emerging in relation, for example, to migrant carers, not only in economically troubled countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain, but also in Austria and Germany. He believes that ‘professionals, management and users need to discuss much more what is important to them, how this can be realised and how different interests may be reconciled’. However, the framework conditions for such dialogue are largely absent in the context of home care.</p><h2>Innovation</h2><p>Nevertheless, there are some initiatives that show that innovative change is possible and these are highlighted in the case studies. One such initiative is Netherlands Neighbourhood Care (Buurtzorg Nederland), which started when a group of district nurses came together to transform nursing and care at home.</p><p>The project gives small, self-organising district teams of highly skilled workers full responsibility for the nursing and care of clients at home. These teams enhance the services available to clients by supporting the contribution of volunteers or by helping clients to access the formal health and social care system. The organisation believes its approach improves the quality and efficiency of home care and enhances the attractiveness of the jobs of district nurse and orderly.</p><p>The long-term care sector offers a way to tackle both the demographic and employment challenges confronting Europe. Increased professionalisation of the sector as well as expectations of quality services from users may well drive improved quality standards in working conditions.</p>"~"Long-term care services is an expanding sector but barriers to job creation exist, such as a shortage of recruits, budgetary constraints and demanding working conditions"~"more-and-better-jobs-cover.jpg"~6~0
"Mapping urban and rural inequalities"~1378910244~1378910244~"<p>While income is the standard measure of material well-being, or of material strain, it is an imperfect one: non-financial dimensions influence quality of life as much as income. Capturing these other dimensions, then, and understanding their impact, is a vital element in assessing quality of life in Europe.</p><p>This was the message that Hans Dubois, Eurofound Research Officer, delivered in a <a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/docs/spotlight/2013/qualityoflife/eugeoconf_20130906.pdf"">presentation (available online)</a> at the <a href=""http://www.eugeo2013.com/"">recent fourth congress of the Association of Geographical Societies in Europe</a> (EUGEO) in Rome on 5–7 September. In his presentation,&nbsp;he focused on the role that rural–urban differences play in shaping social inequalities in Europe, and what changes have resulted in this regard from the economic crisis. For instance, people at the bottom of the income scale living in rural areas have had greater difficulties in the past in making ends meet than their urban counterparts. However, between 2007 and 2011 there was a much greater increase in hardship among poorer urban dwellers, reducing the difference considerably.</p><h2>Health inequality</h2><p>Drawing on data from Eurofound’s most recent <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/index.htm"">European Quality of Life surveys</a> – in 2007 and 2011 – Mr Dubois outlined how findings from the surveys point to the need for multifaceted policy responses to limit inequalities, rather than focusing solely on income. The survey findings highlight inequalities in terms of health and healthcare, public services, the quality of the local environment, social exclusion, and the perceived quality of society. In 2011, for instance, 5% of those in the top income quartile said that their health was ‘bad’ or ‘very bad’ – unchanged since 2007. By contrast, the figure for those in the bottom income quartile was 17%, having risen from 14% – an increase in health inequality.&nbsp;</p><p>Where you live plays a role: people on low incomes in rural areas, and those who are experiencing problems with their local neighbourhood, are more likely to feel that their health is poor. People in rural areas experience greater difficulty in accessing such services as public transport, postal and banking services, and cultural facilities, such as cinemas or theatres (although they are much more satisfied with the quality of their local environment).&nbsp;</p><h2>Social exclusion</h2><p>The surveys investigated social exclusion through measuring people's agreement with such statements as ‘I feel left out of society’, and ‘Some people look down on me because of my job situation or income’. While there was little change on average across the EU between 2007 and 2011, there was a big increase in the proportions of people agreeing with such sentiments in rural areas in Cyprus and Spain, and in towns and cities in Greece and Malta.</p><p>Across Europe, people in urban areas generally feel more socially excluded. And people in urban areas – particularly those who feel socially excluded and who are struggling to repay debts – are also more likely to express little trust in their local government. This raises a practical dilemma: it is local government that is best placed to offer help to those in need. One response, Mr Dubois proposed, is for local government to look at involving NGOs in service delivery.</p><p>The theme of social inequalities is explored in depth in a forthcoming report from Eurofound, <em>Quality of life in Europe: Social inequalities</em>. This is one of four reports conducting further analysis of the 2011 third European Quality of Life survey. The other three, due to be published over the autumn, will look at quality of society and public services, subjective well-being, and trends in quality of life from 2003 to 2012.

The update highlights the ripple effects of such a downscaling for the region. The union for the Walloon self-employed, UCM, estimated that 6,300 indirect jobs would be threatened if the plan went ahead. A survey by the union among 2,700 local companies found that nearly half expect turnover to decrease over the coming three years. A similar percentage did not plan to hire any new staff, even on a temporary basis, in the near future.</p><p>In July, the company proposed a new plan reducing to some extent the proposed closures in Liège. However, this is just one in a series of measures by ArcelorMittal to reduce output and cut jobs across Europe since the economic crisis hit. In 2012 alone, voluntary redundancy and early retirement programmes saw the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2012/08/articles/ro1208019i.htm"" title=""Link to EIRO update "">loss of 1,200 jobs in Galaţi</a>, Romania, and <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/factsheets/19859/ArcelorMittal%20Poland?template=searchfactsheets&amp;kSel=1"" title=""Link to EMCC factsheet"">1,000 jobs across Poland</a>, while the company permanently closed two idle blast furnaces with the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/factsheets/23641/ArcelorMittal?template=searchfactsheets&amp;kSel=1"" title=""Link to EMCC factsheet"">loss of over 600 jobs in Florange</a>, France, in the face of strong government opposition. This year, it prolonged the temporary closure of its plant in Madrid, which relocated 290 employees to other plants in Spain, and closed the doors of its works in Schifflange, Luxembourg, indefinitely.</p><h2>Widespread impact</h2><p>Steel prices have fallen as a result of the slowdown in construction, while prices for iron ore, the source material, have risen because of high demand from China. Steel manufacturers across Europe are reducing production and shedding jobs. In May this year, German steel multinational ThyssenKrupp announced a plan to cut <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/factsheets/24282/ThyssenKrupp"" title=""Link to EMCC factsheet"">3,000 of its 15,000</a> administrative positions worldwide over the next three years, including 1,500 jobs in Essen, Germany. In July, it initiated the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/factsheets/24771/%20ThyssenKrupp%20Galmed%20?template=searchfactsheets&amp;kSel=1"" title=""Link to EMCC factsheet"">closure of its plant in Valencia</a>, Spain, with the loss of 165 jobs. In November 2012, Indian multinational Tata Steel announced plans to <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/factsheets/22757/Tata%20Steel?template=searchfactsheets"" title=""Link to EMCC factsheet"">cut 886 jobs across the UK</a>.&nbsp; The Russian steelmaker Evraz Steel <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/factsheets/19526/evraz"" title=""Link to EMCC factsheet"">laid off 200 workers</a> in 2012 at its plant in the North Moravia region of the Czech Republic and announced a temporary shutdown of operations in early July 2013.</p><p>Addressing such patterns of employment loss will not be easy. The Commission will take stock of progress under the action plan after 12 months and Commissioner Tajani has undertaken to adapt the support efforts as needed.</p><p></p>"~"A summary of the current state of employment in steel manufacturing in Europe"~"774px-Allegheny_Ludlum_steel_furnace.jpg"~6~0

Eurofound Research Manager Anna Ludwinek participated in the meeting, bringing her experience with <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/populationandsociety/clip.htm"">Eurofound’s work on integration of migrants</a>&nbsp;to the discussions.

Ms Ludwinek pointed to the lack of ‘an integrated, coherent approach to EU migration policies’: currently, legislation operates at the Member State level. Three key issues hamper the development of legislation to enable migrants to readily gain good-quality employment.</span></p><ul><li>Policies are defined politically by the non-migrant majority; moreover, they tend to derive from a context of anti-immigrant feeling. This also then affects how policies are assessed.&nbsp;</li><li>Integration of migrants is a long-term process. However, electoral politics operate on short-term cycles; this lack of continuity can hinder the construction of integration policies.&nbsp;</li><li>In terms of work, employers and trade unions are clearly key stakeholders. Currently, however, they are insufficiently engaged at the policy level, and do not participate in the key discussions and decisions.</li></ul><p>This situation is problematic enough, but it exists against a backdrop of austerity, limiting both funding to facilitate the cooperation of busineses, trade union representatives, policymakers and activities and dampening the motivation to combat discrimination in employment. Unfortunately, as Ms Ludwinek went on to highlight, NGOs and local stakeholders advocating for migrant rights are not sufficiently engaged in the European-level policymaking process. An important step would be for EU institutions to cooperate with social partners at the local level, since integration largely succeeds (or fails) at this level.</p><p></p>"~"Lack of an integrated policy approach hinders third-country nationals gaining employment in the EU."~"20081021_2018.jpg"~5~0

"G-20Y Summit provides recommendations for business innovation"~1377514577~1377514577~"<p>Encouraging young and successful business leaders in their diverse roles is crucial during this time of crisis as it encourages innovation in business and community development. But more international cooperation and innovative thinking are needed if sustainable solutions to current economic and social challenges are to be found.</p><p>To help this process and exchange best business practices, the <a href=""http://www.g20ys.org/"" title=""G-20Y Summit website"">fourth G-20Y Summit</a> took place in Saint Petersburg, on 21–25 August, and brought together corporate-level executives, owners of leading companies at national level and around the world (according to Forbes Global 2000 list), as well as young individuals who hold leading positions within government or public institutions. The participants, aged 30–50 years old, are top executives with a track record of achievement.</p><h2>Aim of summit</h2><p>Organised by the G-20Y Summit International Organizing Committee, the summit aimed to promote greater international cooperation and the sharing of innovative ideas in business. It focused on creating a <strong>set of practical recommendations by young business leaders</strong> in a communiqué ‘to be disseminated across the world and shared, in particular, with the G-20 Heads of States and leading international organisations’. The latter include the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD, the European Commission and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.</p><h2>Eurofound findings on workplace innovation</h2><p>The summit programme involved plenary sessions and discussions in working committees, as well as face-to-face meetings. On 22 August, feeding into the debate on ‘<strong>Recommendations on policies to stimulate job creation and labour activities</strong>’, Eurofound research manager Manuel Ortigao presented recent findings of research carried out across Europe on ‘<a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1272.htm"" title=""Link to report and case studies from various Member States"">Work organisation and innovation</a>’.</p><p>Unemployment is still a serious issue for many countries. Adding to the debate on ways to tackle the issue, Mr Ortigao highlighted that workplace innovations come under the umbrella of high performance work practices. To achieve more effective employee involvement and commitment, employers must empower and motivate their workers. This involves a number of key building blocks:</p><ul><li>a shift in management style;</li><li>collective sharing of responsibility;</li><li>trust and communication;</li><li>teamwork;</li><li>skills development and training;</li><li>working time flexibility;</li><li>a good work environment;</li><li>social dialogue.</li></ul><p>These steps can result in improved quality and efficiency of operations, lower costs and more competitive companies.

"Supporting young people through social innovation and investment"~1376927866~1376927866~"<p>As a topic high on the EU agenda at present, social innovation is being seen as a tool to help achieve key objectives outlined by the European Commission in its Social Investment Package (SIP) ‘<a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/socialcohesion/socialinvestmentpackage2013.htm"">Towards social investment for growth and cohesion</a>’, launched in February 2013.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Modernising social protection systems</h2><p>All Member States are dealing with structural, social and demographic challenges, and they have to adapt to ensure that their social systems are both adequate and sustainable. Modernising social policies is a concern at EU level and doing so means supporting people at critical points in their lives so that they can participate to their full potential in social and economic life. Young people are a key target group as many of them have found themselves outside the labour market and society in the crisis period. To avoid more young people being at risk of social exclusion and poverty, Europe recognises the need to invest in expanding young people’s skills and modernising social protection systems. As outlined in the SIP, ‘social innovation must be an integral part of necessary adjustments by testing new policy approaches and selecting the most effective ones.’</p><h2>Promoting social innovation</h2><p>Eurofound’s report <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1354.htm"" title=""See report"">Social innovation in service delivery: New partners and approaches</a> explores how the social partners, civil society and people in vulnerable situations are involved in social innovation – defined as new ideas that simultaneously resolve societal challenges, meet social needs and create new social relationships among the groups concerned.

"Supporting employees with care responsibilities"~1376498284~1376498299~"<p>Caring for a sick or disabled family member is demanding enough in itself; working in paid employment at the same time, as many Europeans do, is particularly hard. However, despite the contribution that working carers make – both to the economy and in terms of providing care – the need to support them in their dual role is only starting to be recognised, at both company and policy level. Without support, it is likely that something will have to give: carers may be unable to contribute optimally in the workplace; they may be less able to provide the kind of care needed; or they may overstrain themselves in the effort to do both.&nbsp;</p><h2>Company initiatives to support carers</h2><p>At a conference held in the University of Leeds, UK, on 13 August, <a href=""http://circle.leeds.ac.uk/events/conferences/carers-and-work-care-reconciliation/"">Carers and work–care reconciliation</a>, Eurofound’s Robert Anderson highlighted a number of examples of <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/populationandsociety/workingcaring/index.htm"">company initiatives to support working carers</a> that Eurofound has documented. Some companies facilitate employees in remaining in employment, through flexible working hours, for instance, or permitting short interruptions of the working day for them to monitor, organise or provide care. Others enable longer periods of either leave or part-time working, some with financial support – by part payment for the time taken. While work-related measures are most common, initiatives also exist whereby employers help organise care-related support – such as information, counselling and supports for the costs of care or in finding care services.&nbsp;</p><h2>Changes needed in the workplace</h2><p>Mr Anderson went on to stress what needs to happen next in order for working and caring to be seen as normal, and for such support to become a mainstream feature of employment. Crucially, awareness of the situation and needs of working carers should be raised; it is a lot lower than in relation to working parents. Managers, supervisors and staff all need to learn more about what it means to juggle work and care commitments, and the benefits that stem from creating a more supportive atmosphere. Particularly important is the role of the carer’s line manager: it is through negotiation with their manager that carers typically resolve day-to-day issues. Interestingly, despite the demands of their dual role, carers who are in employment still fare better than those who are not. Carers not in the workforce suffer worse health, more distress, deeper financial hardship and greater social exclusion.</p><p><a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/docs/spotlight/2013/qualityoflife/work_care_20130813.pdf"">Mr Anderson's PowerPoint presentation</a> is available to view online.

One-fifth have jobs that Eurofound has judged to be of low quality – jobs that pay poorly, offer little chance of career progression and give little sense of fulfilment. These jobs are found disproportionately in companies with fewer than five employees and are more common in the private sector. A further 29% of workers have jobs that pay relatively well, but entail a poor work–life balance.</p><p>Aspiring to quality of work is worthwhile if for no other reason than that&nbsp;better jobs enrich lives and improve well-being. But there is also an economic motivation, one that the European Union has put its weight behind since the Lisbon summit of 2000 with the concept of ‘more and better jobs’. In building its employment strategy the EU has taken the stance that focusing on job quality will give the EU a competitive edge against worldwide competition. Good working conditions develop the potential of the workforce and are a basis for innovative and dynamic business environments that will drive economic growth.</p><p>Soaring unemployment rates have made some EU Member States desperate to find solutions that will create jobs;&nbsp;in such employment troughs,&nbsp;quantity takes precedence over quality. Will the goal of better jobs be shelved until Europe's economy&nbsp;gets back on track?&nbsp;Does economic stability come first?

"Addressing risks facing young people: What kind of policies work?"~1375290564~1375291315~"<p>Although different groups of workers have been badly affected by Europe’s economic situation, the crisis in youth unemployment (23.2% in the EU27, June 2013) is the most critical. In particular, the 14 million young people aged 15–29 across the EU who are <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1254.htm"" title=""Read the report 'NEETs – Young people not in employment, education or training: Characteristics, costs and policy responses in Europe'"">not in employment, education or training (NEET)</a> are most at risk of disengagement and social exclusion.</p><h2>The risk of becoming NEET</h2><p>Certain categories of young people are at a higher risk of becoming NEET, based on their social or economic circumstances.</p><p><strong>Education</strong> – Young people with a low level of education are three times more likely than their peers to become NEET.<br /><strong>Immigration</strong> – Those with an immigration background are 70% more likely. <br /><strong>Disability</strong> – Those with some kind of disability are 40% more likely.<br /><strong>Divorce</strong> – Young people whose parents are divorced are 30% more likely.<br /><strong>Unemployment</strong> – Having parents who experienced unemployment increases the probability by 17%.<br /><strong>Household income</strong> – Those with a low household income are more likely. <br /><strong>Location</strong> – Young people living in a remote area are 1.5 times more likely.</p><h2>What policies work to combat these challenges?</h2><p>Given the current financial restrictions on many EU Member States as a result of the crisis, it is vital that any investment to support these young people and in integrating them back into the labour force is spent effectively. Therefore, the question being asked in the policy debate is ‘what works?’</p><p>A study by Eurofound, <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1260.htm"">Effectiveness of policy measures to increase the employment participation of young people</a>, looked at 25 policies for tackling youth unemployment across some EU Member States.

"Dealing with the exodus of healthcare staff"~1374762215~1374766547~"<p>With Europe’s population ageing, the healthcare sector is of crucial importance. However, across the EU, labour shortages challenge the capacity of health services to deliver effective care.</p><p>Easing labour shortages in the EU15, healthcare workers have moved in substantial numbers from the 10 newer Member States in central and eastern Europe (the ‘EU10’). This movement has in turn created severe labour shortages in these countries.&nbsp;A number of key motivations push healthcare staff to leave. These include:</p><ul><li>poor working conditions;</li><li>low pay;</li><li>a lack of career opportunities for doctors;</li><li>low social status for nurses;</li><li>shortcomings in infrastructure and equipment.</li></ul><h2>Return migration</h2><p>What can be done to stem the flow? Some countries have sought to encourage the return of highly skilled nationals; Bulgaria, for instance, has made this a priority in its new strategy on migration. However, even where healthcare staff find themselves working abroad in positions for which they are over-qualified, the fact of labour shortages in the EU15, as well as those countries’ better living and working conditions, will likely ensure most will remain there.&nbsp;</p><p>One alternative is for the EU10 to encourage the inward migration of skilled professionals from third countries. However, this raises political difficulties: in an environment of high unemployment, encouraging immigration is unlikely to be a popular move. Also migrants are likely to use a Member State in the EU10 as a stepping stone to better-paid jobs available further west.</p><p>Within&nbsp;the EU10 there is a general perception that labour shortages should be solved by wage increases, improving working conditions and retraining – which some Member States have explored. Cutbacks in health spending, however, make such measures difficult.&nbsp;</p><h2>Reforms</h2><p>Various reforms have been introduced; in Hungary the state is taking over the running of hospitals from municipal authorities in an effort to manage them more efficiently. To offset the massive loss of investment in terms of education resulting from emigration, training programmes in Slovakia require a compulsory, stipulated period of service after graduation; alternatively, graduates must provide financial compensation if they leave the country.</p><p>The issue is likely to become only more prevalent over time: those countries waiting to join the EU will probably face similar challenges as those currently&nbsp;being&nbsp;experienced in the EU10.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, see the recently published Eurofound report <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1335.htm"">Mobility and migration of healthcare workers in central and eastern Europe</a>.

"Extra €2 billion pledged for youth jobs"~1373903419~1373904637~"<p>Tackling youth unemployment remains a hot topic on the European policy agenda and a number of recent events focused on best practices across Europe. They heard of substantial extra funding for the worst-affected countries, record levels of youth unemployment in some countries and the need for a diverse approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>More funding to support youth employment</h2><p>On 3 July, EU leaders met at a high-level Conference on Youth Employment in Berlin, hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (see <a href=""http://tvnewsroom.consilium.europa.eu/event/berlin-conference-on-youth-employment"" title=""European Council website: Videos of speeces given by participants at the Berlin Conference on Youth Employment, 3 July 2013"">videos from the event</a>). In attendance were labour ministers, heads of employment agencies and representatives of large companies based in the EU. The aim was to discuss best practices to help young people back into work.</p><p>The EU had already pledged €6 billion to tackle youth unemployment under the <a href=""http://www.consilium.europa.eu/homepage/highlights/council-agrees-on-youth-guarantee?lang=en"">Youth Guarantee</a> scheme. However, at the Berlin event, EU leaders agreed to concentrate national and EU resources to achieve progress more quickly, and thus pledged an extra €2 billion to support youth employment, particularly in countries with a youth unemployment rate above 25%.</p><h2>Job creation and better outcomes for young people</h2><p>Following the Berlin summit, Eurofound participated at other youth events. On 4–5 July, Research Manager Massimiliano Mascherini took part in the IZA/OECD Paris seminar <a href=""http://www.iza.org/conference_files/EMSE2013/viewProgram?conf_id=2476"">Reforming European labour markets: Stimulating job creation and better outcomes for youth</a> where he presented an overview of the European Youth Guarantee and findings from Eurofound research on <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1254.htm"" title=""See report: NEETs - Young people not in employment, education or training: Characteristics, costs and policy responses in Europe"">young people not in employment, education or training (NEET)</a>.</p><p>He drew attention to the EU youth unemployment rate, which reached 23.5% in March 2013, with about half of Member States recording their highest level during the crisis. Speaking about the Youth Guarantee, he emphasised that success in implementation is highly dependent on other public policies in place such as apprenticeships and traineeships, and on the capacity of public employment services to provide adhoc tailored support to young people (see his <a href=""http://eurofound.europa.eu/docs/spotlight/2013/youth/izaoecd_20130705.pdf"" title=""Presentation by Massimiliano Mascherini on the European Youth Guarantee, IZA/OECD seminar 'Reforming European labour markets', Paris, 5 July 2013"">presentation on the European Youth Guarantee (377 KB PDF)</a>.</p><h2><br />Effective policies for reintegrating youth into <br />labour market</h2><p>Massimiliano Mascherini was in action again on 8 July in Brussels at the meeting of the Youth Working Party of the European Council, one of the first events under the <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/presidencies/index.htm"" title=""View Eurofound web page on the Lithuanian Presidency"">Lithuanian Presidency</a>, where he spoke about risk factors and effective policies for the reintegration of young people into the labour market.

"Stark generation gap in Ireland's fortunes"~1368786896~1373008284~"<p>The Irish Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has just published a report finding that the financial and economic crisis in Ireland has affected younger households much more than older households. The report <em>The effect of unemployment, arrears and negative equity on consumption: Ireland in 2009/10</em> finds that between 2004–2005 and 2009–2010, the disposable income and consumption of households headed by someone younger than 35 fell by around 25% and 41% respectively. By contrast, where the head of the household is 55 or older, income rose by 62% and consumption by 50%.</p><p>This stark change in fortunes reflects the national-level effect of a broad pattern of hardship that Eurofound’s <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/eqls/2011/index.htm"">third European Quality of Life Survey</a> (EQLS)&nbsp;has documented across the EU. The EQLS highlights that some countries – including Ireland – have been particularly affected by unemployment and in many cases that young people have fared more badly than other groups.</p><h2>Unemployment</h2><p>The ESRI research emphasises that it is the economic circumstances of Ireland’s younger households, rather than their age as such, that makes them so vulnerable. In addition to the burdens of mortgage or other debt arrears and negative equity, younger households in Ireland are particularly affected by unemployment. And the EQLS finds that a key factor in hardship is unemployment: across the EU, 80% of people living in households where at least one person is unemployed are likely to have difficulties in making ends meet.</p><p>Similarly, when figures for difficulties in meeting housing costs are explored, an age difference emerges. Across the EU27, only a little over 5% of those aged over 64 said their household had been in arrears for rent or mortgage payments over the previous 12 months. By contrast, nearly 15% of those aged between 24 and 34 had been in arrears. For those aged between 35 and 49, the figure was 13%.</p><p>Explore the EQLS data further with the online <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/smt/eqls/results.htm"">Survey Mapping Tool</a>&nbsp;or read the <a href=""http://www.esri.ie/publications/search_for_a_working_pape/search_results/view/index.xml?id=3756"" title=""Report - The effect of unemployment, arrears and negative equity on consumption: Ireland in 2009/10"">ESRI report</a>.</p>"~"See an example of national-level research that relates to Eurofound's  findings on the impact of the crisis"~~5~0
"Changing fortunes in Europe's newest Member State"~1372416574~1373008275~"<p>While Croatia formally become a Member State of the EU on 1 July, Eurofound’s European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) has been covering Croatia for six years – since 2007. From the survey findings emerge a picture of &nbsp;a country in transition, and one with marked generational differences in terms of outlook and attitudes.</p><p>Generally, people in Croatia are less satisfied with their lives than are EU residents on average: on a scale of 1 to 10, they rate their satisfaction with life at 6.8 – below the EU average of 7.1. However, this picture changes when we look at young people in Croatia. Not only are young people the most satisfied of all age groups with their lives in the country; they are also more satisfied than the average for their counterparts in the EU27.</p><p>People here are more optimistic than are EU residents on average, but there are many countries where optimism is more widespread. Again, however, young Croatians are far more optimistic about the future than the older generations (those aged 65 and over).</p><p>Material hardship is a key issue for many people: almost a third of people have difficulties making ends meet. While it is especially difficult for those aged between 40 and 49, younger people find it much easier. This same pattern is found in the other countries that were formerly part of Yugoslavia. This suggests that the consequences for people joining the labour market in times of crisis (in this case the Balkan wars of the 1990s) are large, negative and persistent.&nbsp;</p><p>Eurofound research has found that health, income, and age are the most important factors in people’s level of well-being. Interestingly, in Croatia, being unemployed has less of an impact on how satisfied people are with their lives than in many other EU countries, where the unemployed are much less satisfied with their lives than others. That suggests that people here may have support networks that make them less dependent on the job alone.</p><p></p><p></p>"~~"Dubrovnik (1).jpg"~5~0
"Securing jobs by innovating in work practices and organisation"~1372763208~1372847740~"<p>An economic environment where jobs are constantly under threat concentrates minds on how to strengthen underperforming enterprises so that existing jobs are secured. A lot of optimism has been invested in the potential that innovating in work practices holds for improving productivity.</p><p>This is not a matter of simply putting a squeeze on workers to work harder; current thinking on workplace innovation emphasises that improving the quality of work is inherent in the process, to sustain long-term performance. It's a move away from the hierarchical control practices of Taylorist management towards practices that aim to elicit commitment from workers and devolve decision-making to them.</p><p>But does this scenario of mutual benefit exist only on the pages of textbooks and policy documents? Eurofound has just published the results of a study that back up the theory, providing evidence that it is borne out when these innovations are put into practice. The research is based on case studies of three Irish manufacturing companies (producing car parts, packaging and medical devices), each of which was dealing with problems related to quality or production costs. All three introduced changes in the organisation of work, such as teamworking, lean production (minimising the amount of time and resources used in the production process) and cellular manufacturing (grouping people and resources in a self-contained unit to produce an entire product).</p><h2>Culture shift</h2><p>These changes in the practical organisation of work were underpinned by a shift in organisational culture, which placed much greater priority on employee involvement in decision-making and shifting more responsibility from management to employees. Following these transformations, productivity improved in all enterprises, alongside benefits for staff such as improvements in pay, more opportunities to avail of training, greater job satisfaction and increased autonomy.</p><p>There was also evidence that social dialogue and the involvement of worker representatives made a valuable contribution. Trade union representatives facilitated employee acceptance of the innovations and implementation of the changes in all three companies.</p><p>There is a downside, however, because improvements in efficiency reduce the number of staff needed. In one company, staff numbers fell through natural wastage as the plant’s efficiency increased, while the other two anticipate staff reductions in the future. However, if improved efficiency eventually leads to growth, jobs could conceivably be recouped in the future.</p><p>The benefits of workplace innovations are not uncontested. Other research has found while employees may benefit through increased job satisfaction or profit-sharing, such benefits may entail intensification of work and increased stress.&nbsp;Or the organisation may profit while the gains for employees are relatively minor. The key, then, is to identify and introduce those innovations that create mutual gains for employees and organisations alike.</p><p>To examine the findings in more depth, read the report <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1348.htm"" title=""Work organisation and innovation in Ireland"">Work organisation and innovation in Ireland</a>, which was launched by the Irish Minister of State for Research and Innovation, Sean Sherlock.</p>"~"Read about how innovations in work organisation can benefit both companies and employees"~"Work organisation.jpg"~6~0

"Working in the shadow economy"~1370860244~1370935276~"<p>With decreasing opportunities in the legitimate labour market, it would seem plausible that growing numbers of unemployed workers would be willing to work informally to secure a livelihood, adding to the shadow economy. However, this undeclared economy – paid work that is legal, but not declared to the authorities for tax purposes – has shown an incremental&nbsp;downward trend over the past decade, one that has been largely unaffected by the economic crisis. That said, it remains substantial, estimated to be almost one-fifth of GDP in the EU. The undeclared economies in southern and eastern European Member States are estimated to be above the EU average, the largest being that of Bulgaria, at nearly one-third of GDP.</p><p>Undeclared work&nbsp;is not confined to the unemployed – employed workers, too, top up their incomes with informal work on the side. In fact, in the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland and Sweden, proportionally more employed workers do undeclared work (12%) than unemployed workers (9%). In the rest of Europe, the reverse is true. In the countries of southern Europe, for instance – Cyprus, Greece, Spain, Italy, Malta and Portugal – 12% of the unemployed work undeclared, compared with 2% of the employed workforce.</p><p>(Note that the figures quoted here should be treated with some caution as they are based on indirect methods and survey responses.)&nbsp;</p><h2>Reinforcing marginalisation</h2><p>For unemployed workers in many ways undeclared work reinforces their disadvantage. Their undeclared work is less well paid and their total annual undeclared income is lower than that of employed people engaged in such work. The average hourly undeclared wage of an unemployed worker in the EU is €8.04, for example, but that of an employed worker is 75% more at €14.08.</p><p>Workers in the undeclared sector have none of the legal protections of workers in regular work and have little recourse if things go wrong.&nbsp;And because they don’t contribute to social security and pension systems, their entitlement to benefits is curtailed.</p><p>Apart from creating a marginalised group of workers,&nbsp;the undeclared economy leads to loss of tax revenue for governments and unfair competition for legitimate businesses.

"Building a better future for young people key focus of OECD Forum 2013"~1369928461~1369928461~"<p>Eurofound’s findings on the problems facing young people across Europe and the economic cost of non-integration of those not in employment, education or training (NEETs) were referenced several times at the <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/forum/"" title=""Website for OECD Forum"">OECD Forum 2013</a> on 28–29 May in Paris. Low growth, record high unemployment among young people and their lack of trust in institutions means more needs to be done to rebuild confidence and improve prospects for Europe’s youth. A central aspect of inclusive growth, as one of the main priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy, is to increase employment, especially for young people, invest in their skills and training, as well as modernise labour markets and welfare systems. But the challenge is not unique to the EU and the issue was at the forefront of discussions during the two-day OECD Forum.</p><p>Among others, the sessions on ‘<strong>The Unemployees</strong>’ and ‘<strong>Scars of the Crisis</strong>’ highlighted youth issues and specifically economic and social costs of non-integration of young people into the labour market. Trust in institutions, social exclusion and mental health issues were also prominent in the debate. In addition, young people participating at the Forum highlighted the issues surrounding the provision of internships and establishing a quality framework for their implementation.

"Working to help the ‘lost generation’"~1368723195~1369214971~"<p>The many problems facing young people today are leading to their increased disengagement from education and work, at great cost to Europe in financial terms and in human capital. European policymakers recognise the urgent need to invest in young people in light of the high youth unemployment rate (around 23.5%), the ageing population and many unfilled jobs.</p><p>On 15 May Eurofound joined forces with <a href=""http://www.friendsofeurope.org/"" title=""Find more information on the event on Friends of Europe website"">Friends of Europe</a>, in association with the Irish Presidency, at a skills and education conference in Brussels on <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/events/2013/lostgeneration/index.htm"">Saving Europe’s ‘lost generation’</a>.

"Restructuring in SMEs – Upsides and downsides for jobs"~1369160230~1369161030~"<p>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are major employers in Europe, providing around two-thirds of private sector jobs. Reorganisation of these enterprises – for reasons such as expansion, internal change or avoiding bankruptcy or closure – can have a&nbsp;significant impact on employment.&nbsp;In 60% of SMEs that took part in a study by Eurofound, staff numbers fell as a result of restructuring and in these cases the net reduction in staff was between 15% and 20% on average.</p><p>Lay-offs can be particularly difficult within SMES, as employers work closely with their staff and have built relationships with them. Given that SMEs experience greater difficulties attracting skilled staff, firms also risk losing expertise that they will have difficulty replacing in the event of an upturn in business. For these reasons, in crisis situations, SMEs tend to delay dismissals and often opt for alternatives to lay-offs: one-fifth of the SMEs studied reduced working time, while a similar proportion implemented pay freezes or cuts.</p><p>On a brighter note, about 40% of the restructurings gave rise to new jobs. Increases were in the order of 20% to 35% net on average, but a comparatively high number of companies expanded their workforces by 60% or more; several even doubled their staff numbers.</p><h2>Job quality</h2><p>Aside from the effect on staff numbers, restructuring has an impact on job quality. In half of the companies studied, staff were trained to equip them with new skills for new responsibilities. On the downside, workload increases and stress were reported&nbsp;among some. In&nbsp;a quarter of companies the restructuring&nbsp;caused a worsening of the working atmosphere, conflicts among staff and resistance among the workforce, in spite of efforts by management to communicate its plans and goals.&nbsp;However, more than 20% experienced an improved atmosphere, with increased commitment and motivation among the workforce. In just 5% of the restructurings was a deterioration of the workplace climate a long-term outcome.</p><p>Employment effects are just one topic in&nbsp;this major research project on restructuring in SMEs recently published by Eurofound.&nbsp;Given that SMEs have been recognised as key drivers of growth and innovation by the European Commission, the distinct and specific challenges they face warrant attention.
