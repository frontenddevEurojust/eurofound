"<p>The European business environment has been undergoing a profound "
"transformation, as competition with other global players forces a "
"rethinking of traditional approaches to growth and competitiveness. "
"The nature of industry has changed, with manufacturing and services "
"entering a new equilibrium. European companies have shed jobs in the "
"course of large-scale corporate restructuring. At the same time, new "
"players have entered the market and created jobs in new "
"ventures.</p>\r\n"
"\r\n"
"<p>Eurofound research examines the scale and the nature of economic "
"transformation, looking at sectoral change and emerging future "
"directions. It seeks to identify best practice and useful innovation "
"in business creation and adaptation. And it appraises the relationship "
"between business and society: what are the social responsibilities of "
"business, and how can they best be met?</p>\r\n"

"70% by 2010 and to increase the number of women in employment to more "
"than 60%.</p> <p>The <i>Social Policy Agenda</i> pointed to "
"unemployment as the single most important reason for poverty and "

"fault. This was challenged as violating the Directive, on the basis "
"that infringement of the equal treatment principle, once established, "
"is sufficient to make the employer liable without proof of fault. "

"<p>The <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11992M/htm/11992M.html#0091000016\\>Agreement "
"on Social Policy</a> of 2 February 1992 was annexed to the Protocol on "
"Social Policy of the <a href=\\treatyofmaastricht.htm\\>Treaty of "
"Maastricht</a>.</p>\\r\\n"
"<p>In contrast to the Protocol, it was signed by only eleven EU Member "
"States, excluding the United Kingdom. The agreement goes back to the "
"<a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=521&amp;langId=en&amp;agreementId=1136\\>Joint "
"Agreement of the Social Partners of 31 October 1991</a>, which EU "
"social partners had elaborated in the preparation of the "
"intergovernmental conference in Maastricht. Both texts are almost "
"identical. The Agreement on Social Policy proposed a constitutionally "
"recognised role for the social partners in the community legislative "
"process, which had formerly engaged only the EU institutions. At the "
"same time, a major extension of EC competences in employment and "
"industrial relations was proposed, allowing for qualified majority "
"voting with respect to some of the new competences. The agreement "
"proposed a radical change in the community legislative process for "
"social policy.</p>\\r\\n"
"<p>The Social Policy Protocol of the Treaty of Maastricht also "
"embodied a compromise in the form of an &lsquo;opt-out&rsquo; for the "
"UK, thus creating a &lsquo;twin-track&rsquo; EU social policy. On one "
"track, all 12 Member States would continue to observe and to be bound "
"by the previous provisions of the &lsquo;Social Chapter&rsquo; of the "
"EC Treaty. On the other track, all 12 Member States agreed that 11 "
"Member States could adopt policies on employment and industrial "
"relations, in accordance with the new procedure laid down in the "
"agreement annexed to the Protocol. It was agreed that the UK would not "
"participate in these procedures, nor would it be bound by the outcome "
"of these procedures.</p>\\r\\n"
"<p>Between 1992 and 1997, therefore, a &lsquo;two-speed&rsquo; Europe "
"operated in employment and industrial relations. In accordance with "
"the new social policy procedures of the Protocol and the Agreement on "
"Social Policy, only 11 Member States signed the <a "

"<a href=\\parentalleave.htm\\>parental leave</a> (1996) and <a "
"href=\\parttimework.htm\\>part-time work</a> (1997). It was not until "
"May 1997 that the newly elected UK government decided to terminate the "
"&lsquo;opt-out.&rsquo; The Social Policy Protocol was deleted and the "
"Agreement on Social Policy was incorporated into a revised "

"Directive 2003/88/EC (117Kb PDF)</a> of 4 November 2003, concerning "
"certain aspects of the organisation of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/workingtime.htm\\>working "
"time</a>, ensures a period of paid annual leave of at least four weeks "
"for all employees.</p> <p>Unlike other requirements of daily and "
"weekly rest periods (Articles 3 and 5), the Directive does not allow "
"for any exemption from the requirement for an annual rest period. It "
"is an absolute entitlement that cannot be reduced.</p> <p>Conditions "
"for entitlement and granting are subject to national regulation. "
"However, this cannot replace the minimum period of paid annual leave "
"by an allowance in lieu, except where the employment relationship is "
"terminated.</p> <p>The DirectiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs provision for paid "
"annual leave was the subject of a decision of the <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"(ECJ) in 2001, following a complaint against the United Kingdom. This "
"was brought by the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematographic and "
"Theatre Union (<a href=\\http://www.bectu.org.uk/home\\>BECTU</a>) "
"against the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (<a "
"href=\\http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;num=C-173/99\\>Case "
"C-173/99</a>). The decision was significant in bringing together the "
"provisions in the Directive with the <a "
"href=\\charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter of "
"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>, which states in Article "
"31(2): ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEvery worker has the right toΓΆβ‚¬Β¦ an "
"annual period of paid leaveΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>The UK "
"legislation made entitlement to paid annual leave subject to a "
"qualification period of 13 weeksΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά employment. There "
"is no such qualification in the Directive and BECTU complained to the "
"ECJ that the UK GovernmentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs legislation deprived "
"many of the unionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs members on short-term contracts "
"of their right under EC law to paid annual leave.</p> <p>In its "
"judgement, the ECJ ruled against the UK, arguing that the Working Time "
"Directive:</p> <p><i>ΓΆβ‚¬Β¦does not allow a Member State to "
"adopt national rules under which a worker does not begin to accrue "
"rights to paid annual leave until he has completed a minimum period of "
"13 weeksΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά uninterrupted employment with the same "
"employer.</i></p> <p>More recently, there has been debate about the "
"interaction between annual leave and sick leave.</p> <p>In <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62008J0277:EN:HTML\\>Case "
"C-277/08, Francisco Vicente Pereda v Madrid Movilidad SA</a>, the ECJ "
"ruled in 2009 that a worker who was unfit for work <i>before</i> the "
"commencement of a period of paid annual leave was entitled to take "
"that leave at another time which did not coincide with the period of "
"sick leave.</p> <p>Further clarification was given in June 2012 in "
"judgment <a "
"href=\\http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=124190&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=109815\\> "
"C-78/11</a>. The case concerned the National Association of Large "
"Distribution Companies (<a href=\\http://www.anged.es/\\>ANGED</a>) in "
"Spain and the Federation of Trade Unions (<a "
"href=\\http://www.fasga.com/\\>FASGA</a>) and others. The ECJ ruled "
"that if a worker was sick and incapacitated for work, and where that "
"incapacity occurred during a period of paid annual leave, the worker "
"had the right to receive future annual leave that corresponded to the "
"period of incapacity for work.</p> <p>The ECJ reasoned that, according "
"to settled case law, entitlement to paid annual leave must be regarded "
"as a particularly important principle of EU social law, and one that "
"is expressly enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The right "
"to paid annual leave therefore could not be interpreted "
"restrictively.</p> <p>ECJ case law has established that an "
"individualΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs right to take annual leave is separate "
"from their need to take sick leave. It is also clear that a "
"workerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs annual leave entitlement would not be lost "
"if that worker was sick during annual leave ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the "
"worker would have the right to take the leave at a later date. "
"Further, it does not matter when an employee falls sick "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ it can be before or during the period of annual "
"leave ΓΆβ‚¬β€ and a new period of leave can be scheduled "
"outside the normal reference period for annual leave.</p> <p>See also: "

"<br /> <p>A 2012 European Commission <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=7717&amp;langId=en\\>report "
"(4.77 MB PDF)</a> on the nature and extent of apprenticeship schemes "
"in Member States of the European Union defines such schemes as "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λforms of Initial Vocational Education and Training "
"(IVET) that formally combine and alternate company-based training "
"(periods of practical work experience at a workplace) with "
"school-based education (periods of theoretical/practical education "
"followed in a school or training centre), and whose successful "
"completion leads to nationally recognised initial VET certification "
"degreesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>According to the report, 24 EU "
"Member States have VET schemes in place which are mainly "
"company-based, in the sense that more than half of the training "
"activities take place in a company. However, in a majority of these "
"countries, company-based apprenticeships coexist with other, mainly "
"school-based, training schemes. In these cases, tuition takes place in "
"a formal educational setting most of the time, but significant "
"components of training are carried out at companies in a real work "
"setting.</p> <p>Apprenticeships are viewed by the EU institutions as a "
"valuable tool to help young people enter the labour market. They are "
"seen as especially significant in the context of high and rising youth "
"unemployment in the EU.</p> <p>The CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 2012 "
"report puts forward the following recommendations for policy "
"action:</p> <ul> <li>maintaining homogeneous quality standards for "
"apprenticeship-type studies;</li> <li>ensuring a balance between "
"specific occupational skills and general skills and competences;</li> "
"<li>involving the social partners in the design and organisation of "
"apprenticeships, as this is a key factor in their success;</li> "
"<li>taking initiatives to improve the general image of the vocational "
"education system among students.</li> </ul> <p>The "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 2012 Communication <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52012DC0727:EN:NOT\\>Moving "
"Youth into Employment</a> points to three main success factors for "
"apprenticeship schemes:</p> <ul> <li>building of effective "
"partnerships between vocational education and training (VET), "
"schools/institutions and companies, with the involvement of the social "
"partners;</li> <li>ensuring that both the qualification gained and the "
"learning process is of high quality to exploit the full potential of "
"apprenticeships and that this model is recognised as a valuable "
"learning pathway, transferable across borders, and opening up access "
"to high-skilled jobs;</li> <li>integrating apprenticeships into the "
"national or regional education and training system, based on a clear "
"regulatory framework.</li> </ul> <p>In the Communication, the "
"Commission commits itself to creating a European Alliance for "
"Apprenticeships, which would bring together stakeholders from "
"authorities, business and social partners, VET researchers and "
"practitioners, and youth representatives. It would also encourage "
"successful apprenticeship schemes and put forward ways to create more "
"of them.</p> <p>Moreover, the alliance would also help to develop "
"common dual training curricula for various professions, facilitate "
"recognition of apprenticeships undertaken abroad and promote an "
"appropriate regulatory framework.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"\\n"
"        <p>At EU level, the regulation of atypical work has taken a "
"number of directions. One was an attempt to formulate a new legal "
"concept of\\n"
"        worker/employee so that the legal category of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛemploymentΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and the criterion of "
"subordination should not be used as the crude instrument for making\\n"
"        distinctions between workers. The "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Communication on the Social Agenda of "

"ΓΆβ‚¬Λanalyse\\n"
"        current trends in new work patterns and the role of labour law "
"in tackling these developmentsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (COM (2005) 33 final, "
"Brussels, 9 February 2005). The\\n"
"        subsequent Green Paper, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52007DC0627:EN:HTML\\>Modernising "
"labour law to meet the\\n"
"        challenges of the 21st century</a>, presented on 22 November "
"2006, noted the increase in the proportion of non-standard or atypical "
"contracts, with a\\n"
"        strong gender and intergenerational dimension, as women, older "
"and also younger workers were disproportionately represented in "
"non-standard\\n"
"        employment.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>A second direction is to focus attention on the issue of <a "
"href=\\n"
"        "
"\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/workingtime.htm\\>working "
"time</a>. The starting point is that workers\\n"
"        with different working time schedules should not be a priori "
"excluded from consideration when labour standards are in question. "
"However, that is not to\\n"
"        say that all should a priori benefit from the same labour "
"standards. It is probable that different working time schedules imply "
"different needs, and\\n"
"        hence different standards may be applicable.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>EC law on atypical workers reflects how the grounds for <a "
"href=\\n"

"\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/discrimination.htm\\>discrimination</a> "
"have been extended. The right\\n"
"        of atypical workers to equal treatment, regardless of "
"characteristics such as sex, race, age and disability, highlights a "
"new dimension of the equality\\n"
"        principle in equality law. It requires equal treatment of "
"workers, regardless of working hours, duration of employment, place of "
"work or the nature of\\n"
"        the employment relationship. These concepts were key in the "

"<br /> <p>An autonomous agreement is an agreement signed by the "
"European social partners at cross-sector or sector level. At "
"cross-sector level, the social partners are ETUC, BUSINEESSEUROPE, "
"CEEP and UEAPME and the agreement is negotiated either on the basis of "
"a Commission consultation to the social partners under Article 154 "
"TFEU or on a topic of their choosing. Article 155 TFEU provides two "
"options for the implementation of agreements concluded by the EU-level "
"social partners under Article 154. The first option is implementation "
"in accordance with the procedures and practices specific to management "
"and labour and the Member States. The second option is to request a "
"Council of Ministers decision, following a proposal by the Commission. "
"If the agreement is implemented in accordance with the first option, "
"it is considered to be an autonomous agreement.</p> <p>There have been "
"four autonomous agreements concluded at cross-sector level so far: on "
"<a href=\\telework.htm\\>telework</a> in 2002, <a "
"href=\\stressatwork.htm\\>stress at work</a> in 2004, <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/news/2007/apr/harassment_violence_at_work_en.pdf\\>harassment "
"and violence at work</a> in 2007, and <a "
"href=\\inclusivelabourmarkets.htm\\>inclusive labour markets</a> in "
"2010. In these cases, the social partners established a general "
"framework at EU level obliging their affiliated organisations to "
"implement the agreement in accordance with the national procedures and "
"practices specific to management and labour and the Member States. "
"These agreements had previously been described as "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛvoluntaryΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά agreements, but with the "
"coming into effect of the <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/IMG/pdf/Depliant_EN_HD2006-2008.pdf\\>work "
"programme 2006-2008</a>, the European social partners changed the "
"terminology for this kind of accord to "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛautonomousΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά agreements</p> <p>For "
"details of the framework agreements that the cross-sector European "
"social partners have concluded that have been ratified by the Council "
"of Ministers and now form part of European legislation (on <a "

"href=\\frameworkagreements.htm\\>framework agreements</a>.</p> <p>The "
"agreement on the regulation of telework was a landmark agreement, as "
"it was the first agreement to be implemented by means of procedures "
"and practices specific to management and labour and the Member States, "
"rather than Council decision. Two consultations of the European social "
"partners by the European Commission based on Article 138 of the EC "
"Treaty (now 154 TFEU) took place, and after eight months of "
"negotiations, an agreement was formally signed in July 2002. The "
"agreement includes a definition of telework and regulates employment "
"conditions for teleworkers, health and safety, training and collective "
"rights.</p> <p>The stress at work agreement had its origins in a "
"social partner consultation launched by the European Commission on <a "

"stress and its effects on health and safety at work</a> under Article "
"138 of the EC Treaty (now 154 TFEU) in 2002. The European level social "

"first <a href=\\http://www.etuc.org/IMG/pdf/work_programme2.pdf\\>work "
"programme</a> 2003-2005. In October 2004, they signed an autonomous "

"consultation</a> of the social partners concerning violence at the "

"work programme 2003-2005</a> in which the social partners had "

"partners started negotiations on harassment and violence and "
"eventually concluded an <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/a/3574\\>agreement</a> in April 2007. This "
"commits the parties to combat all unacceptable behaviour that can lead "
"to harassment and violence at the workplace.</p> <p>In the work "

"<p>The EU Blue Card is an approved EU-wide work permit that allows "
"highly skilled non-EU citizens to work and live within any country in "
"the European Union, other than Denmark, Ireland and the UK. It offers "
"a one-track procedure for non-EU nationals to apply for a work permit "
"which is valid for up to two years and which can be renewed. Those "
"granted a Blue Card also have some rights to family "
"reunification.</p>\r\n"
"\r\n"
"<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"
"\r\n"
"<p>On 14 and 15 December 2006 the European Council agreed a series of "
"steps for 2007, among which was to develop well-managed legal <a "
"href=\"\\immigration.htm\\\">immigration</a> policies. The Commission "
"presented a proposal for a ΓΆβ‚¬ΛBlue Card "
"DirectiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά to the Council in October 2007. In "
"November 2008 the European Parliament delivered its opinion on such a "
"directive. <a "

"Directive 2009/50/EC</a> of 25 May 2009, establishing the conditions "
"of entry and residence of <a "
"href=\"\\thirdcountrynationals.htm\\\">third-country nationals</a> for "
"the purposes of highly qualified employment, was subsequently adopted. "
"The term ΓΆβ‚¬Λthird-country nationalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"applies to any person who is not a citizen of the Union (Art. 3 TEU). "
"The legal basis for the directive is Article 79 TFEU. The Directive "
"does not apply to third-country nationals who have been admitted to "
"the protection of a Member state on the basis of a claim for asylum, "
"refugee status, or who are researchers, family members of Union "
"citizens, seasonal workers or have long-term residency status. Member "
"States have until 19 June 2011 to transpose the Directive.</p>\r\n"
"\r\n"
"<p>The rationale for the Blue Card is in its contribution to the "
"implementation of the <a href=\"\\lisbonstrategy.htm\\\">Lisbon "
"Strategy</a>, through enhancing the knowledge-based economy in Europe "
"and through fostering mobility. The Blue Card applies to third-country "
"nationals for stays of more than three months through a fast-track "
"admission procedure. Successful applicants are granted the same "
"economic rights as the nationals of host Member States. Most possess "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λhigher professional qualificationsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, "
"that is ΓΆβ‚¬Λqualifications attested by evidence of higher "
"education qualifications or, by way of <a "
"href=\"\\derogation.htm\\\">derogation</a>, when provided for by "
"national law, attested by at least five years of professional "
"experienceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Higher education qualifications require "
"studies of at least three years (Art. 2). Blue Card holders must also "
"be paid no less than the minimum salary level comparable with the "
"salary levels in Member States for similar professional "
"qualifications, which must be at least 1.5 times the average gross "
"annual salary in the Member State concerned (Art. 5). Member States "
"must set a standard period of validity for the card of between one and "
"four years and, if less than a year, it must be issued or renewed for "
"the duration of the work contract plus three months.</p>\r\n"
"\r\n"
"<p>To be eligible for the Blue Card, an applicant must have a valid "
"work contract or binding job offer for highly qualified employment for "
"at least one year (Art 5). For the first two years of entry, a card "
"holder must do the job for which the card was originally issued. After "
"this the Member State can give the holder wider access to the European "
"job market (Art. 12). Blue Card holders enjoy equal access to the <a "
"href=\"\\socialsecurity.htm\\\">social security</a> rights already "
"provided to third-country nationals who have cross-border elements "
"between Member States. On admission under the Blue Card scheme, the "
"holder and his/her family acquire progressive residence and mobility "
"rights. The Blue Card is separate to any other system of national "
"residence permits for third-country workers that the Member State "
"might introduce.</p>\r\n"
"\r\n"
"<p>Third-country nationals in possession of a valid travel document "
"and a Blue Card issued by a Member State applying the Schengen "
"Agreement in full have rights of entry and free mobility within the "
"territory of any other Member state that also fully applies the "

"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ alongside the ETUC and Eurocadres "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the third cross-industry confederation representing "

"(98) 322 final</a>, ΓΆβ‚¬ΛAdapting and promoting the social "

"recognises CEC as a social partner which represents "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λcertain categories of workers or "
"undertakingsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά at a cross-industry level. As a result, "
"the Commission is required to seek CECΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs opinion as "
"well as offer CEC the chance to enter into negotiations with employers "
"on social policy and industrial relations issues as set down by "
"articles 154 and 155 TFEU governing European social dialogue. CEC has "
"participated in the cross-sectoral social dialogue since 1999.</p> "
"<p>Like <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/eurocadres.htm\\>Eurocadres</a>, "
"CEC organises and represents professional and managerial staff in "
"Europe. However, while Eurocadres is associated with <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>, "
"and its member organisations are mainly sections of general unions, "
"CEC is an independent social partner whose member organisations are "
"specifically dealing with executives and professional staff.</p> "
"<p>Founded in 1989, CEC is made up of 9 European branch federations "
"and 17 national organisations, accounting for a total of 1.5 million "
"managers and professionals in 15 European countries. CEC has four "
"officers (President, Secretary-General, Deputy Secretary-General and "
"Treasurer) and three constitutional bodies: the General Assembly which "
"meets every three years, sets the general policy guidelines, elects "
"the officers and controls the activities of the other bodies; the "
"Steering Committee which performs all actions necessary to run the "
"organisation; and the Executive Committee which mainly acts on powers "
"delegated to it by the Steering Committee.</p> <p>In 1999, Eurocadres "
"and CEC agreed on a formal cooperation for the European social "
"dialogue. The cooperation between CEC and Eurocadres is based on some "
"common principles:</p> <ul> <li>Despite being employees, managers and "
"executives have specific needs and interests which are best "
"represented by specific organisations (such as CEC and "
"Eurocadres);</li> <li>To represent these interests adequately, it is "
"necessary to actively participate in all possible forms of social "
"dialogue at EU level;</li> <li>The formulation of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/jointopinions.htm\\>joint "
"opinions</a> and positions among the three cross-industry employee "
"confederations is a prerogative for successfully influencing European "
"social dialogue.</li> <li>of the results of the Eurocadres/CEC "
"cooperation agreement was the establishment of a Liaison Committee (<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/1999/08/feature/eu9908186f.htm\\>EU9908186F</a>). "
"During negotiations in social dialogue this Liaison Committee is "
"usually part of ETUCΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs delegation. In general, the "
"cooperation between ETUC, Eurocadres and CEC works very well. In its "
"Activity Report 2006/2007, CEC states: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛAlthough they "

"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/32007X1214/htm/C2007303EN.01000101.htm\\>Charter "
"of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> was signed and "
"solemnly proclaimed by the Presidents of the Commission, the European "
"Parliament and the Council on 12 December 2007, paving the way for the "
"signing of the <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:SOM:en:HTML\\>Treaty "
"of Lisbon</a> the following day. Article 1(8) of the Treaty recognises "
"the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter and states "
"that these shall have the same legal value as the Treaties. The "
"Charter of Fundamental Rights was initially solemnly proclaimed at the "
"Nice European Council on 7 December 2000, but this was merely a "
"political commitment carrying no binding legal effect.</p> <p>The "
"Charter had been adapted, particularly as regards its general "
"provisions, with a view to making it legally binding and this approach "
"was confirmed at the European Council of June 2007, during the "
"negotiations on the mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference and "
"during the Conference itself.</p> <p>The Charter was given legal "
"status by the Lisbon Treaty, which came into force on 1 December 2009. "
"Article 6 of the Treaty states that the Union recognises the rights, "
"freedoms and principles set out in the Charter, and that it shall have "
"the same legal value as the Treaties. Nevertheless, Article 6 also "
"states that the provisions of the Charter shall not extend, in any "
"way, the competences of the Union as defined in the Treaties.</p> "
"<p>However, in advance of the Charter being ratified at the 2007 "
"Intergovernmental Conference, special arrangements were agreed with "
"the United Kingdom and Poland which enabled the binding nature of the "
"Charter to be maintained and for it to be applied in full to the other "
"25 Member States. In the case of the UK, the Charter contains a "
"legally binding protocol, which states no court can rule that the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λlaws, regulations or administrative provisions, "
"practices or actionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of the UK are inconsistent with "
"the principles laid down in the charter. Further, it states that the "
"Charter creates no new rights enforceable in the UK, over and above "
"those already provided for in national law. There has been some debate "
"about how this will work in practice and whether it will be open to "
"legal challenge on the grounds that it violates a principle that EU "
"law must be applied uniformly to all member states.</p> <p>The EU "
"Charter represents a significant contribution to the promotion of "
"rights on employment and industrial relations in the EU. It is an "
"independent source of rights and is not limited to national practice "
"in individual Member States. The Charter breaks new ground by "
"including in a single list of <a "
"href=\\fundamentalrights.htm\\>fundamental rights</a>, not only "
"traditional civil and political rights, but also social and economic "
"rights, proving that these latter rights are recognised as having the "
"same status as civil and political rights. Finally, the Charter puts "
"pressure on EU institutions to promote a <a "
"href=\\europeansocialmodel.htm\\>European social model</a>.</p> "
"<p>Within the CharterΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 45 Articles there are a "
"number that may be relevant to employment-related matters. These "
"include: the prohibition of slavery and forced labour (Article 5); "
"freedom of expression and information (Article 11); freedom of "
"assembly and <a href=\\freedomofassociation.htm\\>freedom of "

"<li>workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά right to information and consultation "

"conditions provided for by Community law and national laws and "
"practices;</li> <li>right of <a "

"href=\\restperiods.htm\\>rest periods</a> and to an annual period of "
"paid leave;</li> <li>prohibition of <a href=\\childlabour.htm\\>child "
"labour</a> and protection of young people at work (Article 32), which "
"notes that, excepting more favourable provisions and limited <a "
"href=\\derogation.htm\\>derogation</a>, the minimum age of admission "
"to employment may not be lower than the minimum school-leaving age. "
"Further, working conditions for young people must be appropriate to "

"any work likely to harm their safety, health or physical, mental, "
"moral or social development or to interfere with their education;</li> "
"<li>family and professional life (Article 33), which gives everyone "

"services providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, "
"industrial accidents, dependency or old age, and loss of employment, "

"        <p>Co-determination is a structure of decision-making within "
"the enterprise whereby employees and their representatives exert "
"influence on decisions,\\n"
"        often at a senior level and at a relatively early stage of "
"formulation. Co-determination may operate in parallel to, and "
"complement, other industrial\\n"
"        relations mechanisms of employee representation and influence. "
"It does not substitute for other mechanisms of employee influence on "
"management\\n"
"        decision-making, such as collective bargaining.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Co-determination is rooted in the industrial relations "
"traditions of a number of EU Member States. For example, in Germany "
"there are two distinct\\n"
"        levels of co-determination: at establishment level via the "
"works council, and at enterprise level, on the supervisory board of "
"companies. In Austria,\\n"
"        works councils have the right to negotiate a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λsocial planΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in the event of decisions "
"involving restructuring, which may lead to job losses. In Denmark,\\n"
"        employees have the right to elect a third of members of the "
"company board, and through this mechanism they exercise a powerful "
"voice in votes on\\n"
"        matters that can have a major impact on the workforce.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Elements of co-determination feature in a number of EU "
"directives. These directives require employees and their "

"        advance of decisions that will affect their interests, and "
"impose procedures for their consultation, and other forms of "

"\\n"
"        <p>Non-binding codes of conduct are contrasted, often "
"unfavourably, with legally binding norms of EU social law and policy. "
"It is often easier for the\\n"
"        EU Member States to accept EU measures in the form of "
"non-binding codes of conduct than legally binding <a "

"        of conduct by their very nature are non-binding and merely "

"\\n"
"        <p>It is important to note, however, that some codes of "
"conduct, despite their non-legally binding nature, may have an impact "
"on the practices and\\n"
"        behaviour of public authorities and private individuals, and "
"on employers, employees and their organisations. In some cases, their "
"impact may even\\n"
"        exceed that of formally legally binding measures. Whether a "
"code of conduct or a legally binding measure is appropriate for "
"regulation of an area of\\n"
"        employment or industrial relations is a matter of political "
"and empirical judgement.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Codes of conduct are also found in other EU contexts. They "
"may be embodied in agreements between the social partners. For "
"example, a code of conduct\\n"
"        on labour standards in the textile industry was reached "
"between the employer organisations and trade unions (Euratex and ETUC: "
"TCL) on 10 July 1997,\\n"
"        covering 60-70% of enterprises in the sector in Europe. An "
"EU-level code of conduct in the private security sector was signed on "
"18 July 2003 by the\\n"
"        employer organisation, the Confederation of European Security "
"Services (CoESS) and the trade union organisation, Uni-Europa. The "

"600,000 workers, increasing to some 20,000 enterprises and 1.1 million "
"workers following\\n"
"        EU enlargement.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Codes of conduct regulating labour standards have also been "

"trade unions and\\n"
"        the multinational Artsana, which produces Chicco "

"<br /> <p>Collective bargaining is the process of negotiation between "

"of trade unions. It is a process of rule making, leading to joint "
"regulation.</p> <p>The central role of collective bargaining between "
"workers and employers and their organisations in industrial relations "
"in the Member States is recognised by the EU in Article 28 of the "
"Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of December 2000 "
"(ΓΆβ‚¬ΛRight of Collective Bargaining and "

"<p>ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe Right to Bargain CollectivelyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"was also declared a fundamental right in the 1961 European Social "
"Charter of the Council of Europe (Article 6). The interpretation by "
"the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg of the right to "
"freedom of association in Article 11 of the European Convention for "
"the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms has extended "
"some protection also to collective bargaining (<i>Wilson and the "
"National Union of Journalists; Palmer, Wyeth and the National Union of "
"Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers; Doolan and others v. United "
"Kingdom</i>, decided 2 July 2002).</p> <p>Just as collective "
"bargaining receives legal support in the Member States, this array of "
"European legal guarantees provides the background for the "
"EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs recognition of the centrality of collective "
"bargaining. The operation of collective bargaining in EU industrial "
"relations is multi-faceted, as evident in the various functions "
"attributed to <a "
"href=\\collectiveagreementsandworkingconditions.htm\\>collective "
"agreements</a> by EU <a href=\\directives.htm\\>Directives</a> and the "
"growing role of <a href=\\europeancollectiveagreements.htm\\>European "
"collective agreements</a>. At EU level, collective bargaining takes "
"place at inter-confederal/inter-sectoral, multi-sectoral, "
"industry/sectoral, enterprise and inter-regional level.</p> "
"<p>Collective bargaining is a means of implementing EU directives in "
"the field of employment and industrial relations. Therefore, one "
"specific process of collective bargaining takes place when "
"negotiations develop ΓΆβ‚¬Λin the shadow of the "
"law.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά This is exemplified by <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31994L0045:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 94/45/EC</a> of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of a "
"European Works Council, or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings "
"and Community-scale groups of undertakings, for the purposes of "
"informing employees and consulting with them ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the <a "
"href=\\europeanworkscouncils.htm\\>European Works Councils</a> (EWC) "
"Directive. The directive is characterised by a strategy, which is "
"apparently assuming greater prominence in the EU system: the "
"delegation to the social partners, <a "
"href=\\managementandlabour.htm\\>management and labour</a>, of the "
"competence to negotiate the relevant European <a "
"href=\\labourstandards.htm\\>labour standards</a> . The EWC is to be "
"negotiated by the central management of the multinational enterprise "
"and the representatives of the workforce; they must negotiate "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λin a spirit of cooperation with a view to reaching an "
"agreement on the detailed arrangements for implementing the "
"information and consultation of employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article "
"6). However, the Directive shapes the negotiating process by "
"explicitly providing that, if agreement is not reached, minimum "
"(subsidiary) requirements laid down in an Annex to the Directive will "
"apply (Article 7(1)). In practice, therefore, the structure of "
"negotiations between the parties is influenced by the subsidiary "
"requirements. Also in the case of the establishment of a <a "
"href=\\europeancompany.htm\\>European company</a> or a <a "
"href=\\europeancooperativesociety.htm\\>European Cooperative "
"Society</a> , management has to negotiate at European level with a <a "
"href=\\specialnegotiatingbody.htm\\>special negotiating body</a> "
"composed of representatives from various Member States.</p> <p>The "
"increasing number of <a "
"href=\\transnationalenterprise.htm\\>transnational enterprise</a> "
"undergoing <a href=\\restructuring.htm\\>restructuring</a> represents "
"another driver for collective bargaining at European level. There are "
"already cases in which <a "
"href=\\europeanindustryfederations.htm\\>European industry "
"federations</a> and/or European Works Councils have signed <a "
"href=\\frameworkagreements.htm\\>framework agreements</a> concerning "
"the social regulation of restructuring processes. Other framework "
"agreements that were negotiated at European level deal with labour "
"policies and labour standards.</p> <p>As part of its Social Agenda for "
"the period 2005-2010, the <a href=\\europeancommission.htm\\>European "
"Commission</a> initiated a discussion on setting up an optional legal "
"framework for transnational collective bargaining. With the growth of "
"transnational enterprises, the continuing pressure of takeovers and "
"mergers and the extension and development of European Works Councils, "
"transnational collective bargaining is expected to become more common. "
"Therefore, the European Commission believes that a legal framework "
"might become necessary to regulate such issues as defining the actors "
"entitled to negotiate, the form and content of agreements, the legal "
"effect of agreements, links to national and sectoral agreements as "
"well as the right to collective action. Such an approach is anchored "

"the oil crisis of 1973, which led to many closures and <a href=\\n"

"        information, consultation and notification requirements laid "

"<br /> <p>Comitology (or ΓΆβ‚¬Λcommittee "
"procedureΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά) refers to the procedures under which the "
"<a href=\\europeancommission.htm\\>European Commission</a> executes "
"its implementing powers delegated to it by the legislative branch "
"(i.e. the <a href=\\europeanparliament.htm\\>European Parliament</a> "
"and the <a href=\\counciloftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Council of the "
"European Union</a>) with the assistance of so called "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λcomitology committeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά consisting of "
"Member State representatives. This delegation of power is now based on "
"Article 290TFEU.</p> <p>Comitology committees emerged in the 1960s "
"when the Council realised that it lacked the resources to make all "
"necessary implementation rules and decided to delegate implementing "
"powers to the Commission. Today, most EU regulation is not enacted as "
"legislation by the European Council or the European Parliament but as "
"implementation measures under the executive duties of the "
"Commission.</p> <p>A first comitology decision rationalising the "
"committee structure and establishing the rules and principles was "
"adopted in 1987. It was revised in 1999 (Council Decision 99/468 "
"laying down the procedure for the Exercise of Implementing Powers "
"Conferred on the Commission). In order to keep some legislative "
"control over the implementation procedures, it was decided that the "
"Council can force the Commission to adopt implementation measures only "
"after a comitology process. Thus, comitology enables the Member States "
"to influence decision-making even when powers have been delegated to "
"the Commission.</p> <p>Three types of committees are provided for "
"under the Council Decision 99/468: these have varying levels of "
"legislative control over the Commission and follow different "
"procedures. The type of committee assigned normally depends on the "
"policy area being regulated.</p> <ul> <li>Advisory committees: The "
"Commission submits a draft of the proposed measure to the Committee "
"and the Committee delivers its opinion. The Commission is not bound by "
"this opinion, but shall take the ΓΆβ‚¬Λutmost "
"accountΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of it and has to inform the committee on the "
"manner in which its opinion has been taken into account. This "
"procedure is used when policy matters considered are not very "
"sensitive politically.</li> <li>Management committees: Their "
"responsibility is to oversee management measures, especially those "
"affecting agricultural policy, fisheries, and main Community projects. "
"In the case of management committees, if the measures adopted by the "
"Commission are not consistent with the committeeΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"opinion, the Commission has to communicate them to the Council which "
"can overrule the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs proposal.</li> "
"<li>Regulatory committees: These committees follow similar rules to "
"the management committees, the main difference being that if finally "
"the Council does not take a decision on issues being referred back to "
"it by committees because of disagreement over a certain measure "
"planned by the Commission, the Commission may adopt this measure "
"provided that the Council does not object with a qualified majority. "
"This procedure is used for measures relating to protection of health "
"or safety and measures amending non-essential provisions of the basic "
"legislative instruments.</li> </ul> <p>The 1999 Comitology decision "
"brought some improvements concerning the transparency of the work of "
"the committees, e.g. by introducing an <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm\\>online "
"register of all comitology documents</a> that are transmitted to the "
"European Parliament.</p> <p>Despite the 1999 Comitology decision, "
"comitology procedures have since been a matter of dispute amongst the "
"different European bodies. While the Council was satisfied with the "
"situation defined by the 1999 Comitology decision, the Commission held "
"the position that its own decision-making role and its discretion in "
"executive powers should be widened and therefore the role of the "
"comitology committees restricted (see e.g. the 2001 <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/governance/white_paper/en.pdf\\>White paper "
"on European Governance</a> or the 2002 <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2002:0728:FIN:EN:PDF\\>Communication "
"on Institutional Architecture</a>). The Parliament wanted to restrict "
"the delegation of implementation measures to the Commission (and the "
"committees) to purely routine measures: the role of the Parliament as "
"co-legislator in procedures of legislative oversight should be "
"strengthened and, consequently, the competences of both the Commission "
"and the committees be restricted.</p> <p>Despite these different "

"necessary rules for applying new laws in the Member States. Under the "
"new compromise, MEPs will only be able to confer powers on the "
"Commission for an indefinite period, except in exceptional "
"circumstances.</p> <p>Information rights: In order to ensure an "

"Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers,</a> adopted on 9 "
"December 1989 by a declaration of all Member States, with the "
"exception of the United Kingdom, established the major principles on "
"which the European labour law model is based and shaped the "
"development of the <a href=\\europeansocialmodel.htm\\>European social "
"model</a> in the following decade. The fundamental social rights "
"declared in the Community Charter are further developed in the <a "

"binding with the ratification of the <a "
"href=\\treatyoflisbon.htm\\>Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December "
"2009</a>.</p> <p>Since 1985, increasing concern had been expressed at "
"all levels at the social consequences of the creation of the <a "
"href=\\singleeuropeanmarket.htm\\>Single European Market</a>, and "
"there was a perceived need for the formulation and implementation of a "
"comprehensive social dimension for the 1992 programme. In 1988, a "
"working party of the Commission proposed a body of minimum social "
"provisions. Following a Resolution on Fundamental Rights of the "
"European Parliament in March 1989, a first draft of a Community "
"Charter of Fundamental Social Rights was published by the Commission "
"in May 1989, a second draft was produced in October 1989 and the "
"summit in Strasbourg on 9 December 1989 approved the final "
"Charter.</p> <p>Under this Charter, the Community is obliged to "
"provide for the fundamental social rights of workers under the "
"following headings:</p> <ul> <li>Freedom of movement (Articles 1 to "
"3)</li> <li>Employment and remuneration (Articles 4 to 6)</li> "
"<li>Improvement of living and working conditions (Articles 7 to "

"StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά action (implementation) (Articles 27 to "
"30)</li> </ul> <p>The Charter represents a commitment by the Member "
"States to a set of social policy and labour law objectives. Article 28 "
"stipulates: <i>ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe European Council invites the "
"Commission to submit as soon as possible initiatives which fall within "
"its powers, as provided for in the Treaties, with a view to the "
"adoption of legal instruments for the effective implementation, as and "
"when the internal market is completed, of those rights, which come "
"within the CommunityΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs area of "
"competence.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</i></p> <p>In order to achieve these "
"objectives, the European Commission adopted a <a "
"href=\\socialactionprogramme.htm\\>Social Action Programme</a> to "
"implement the Charter (COM (89) 568 final). Hence, despite its merely "
"declaratory character and the opposition of the UK government, the "
"Charter was instrumental in the launching of initiatives in employment "
"and industrial relations policy, which produced a number of <a "
"href=\\directives.htm\\>directives</a> during the 1990s. Among these "
"are the 1992 directive regarding <a "
"href=\\pregnancyandmaternity.htm\\>pregnancy and maternity</a>, the "

"href=\\parentalleave.htm\\>parental leave</a>, <a "
"href=\\parttimework.htm\\>part-time work</a> and <a "
"href=\\fixedtermwork.htm\\>fixed-term work</a>. The Charter "
"anticipated much of the potential of the fundamental individual "

"href=\\http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/default_en.htm\\>Charter "
"of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>, adopted in Nice in "
"December 2000.</p> <p>The legal status of the Community Charter is "
"that of a mere political declaration, as stated in its preamble, "
"since, due to the opposition of the UK government, the Charter could "
"not be integrated into the EC Treaty in 1989. The UK eventually "
"acceded to the Charter, following the election of a new government in "
"May 1997.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the preamble to the <a "

"<br /> <p>The Member States confer on the European Union competences "
"or powers and these are laid down in the Treaties. Article 5 (1) TEU "
"stipulates: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe limits of Union competences are "
"governed by the principle of conferral. The use of Union competences "
"is governed by the principles of subsidiarity and "
"proportionality.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>The Union, therefore, is "
"only competent to act within the scope of the powers allocated to it. "
"Any measures adopted by the EU institutions must be founded on a legal "
"basis in the Treaty.</p> <p>However, these competences or powers have "
"been greatly extended ΓΆβ‚¬β€ as far as the subject matter "
"with which the Community was concerned ΓΆβ‚¬β€ by the <a "
"href=\\singleeuropeanact.htm\\>Single European Act</a> (SEA) and the "
"Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice. The scope of competences "
"has been expanded by a doctrine of the implied powers, developed by "
"the European Court of Justice, which held that the Union had powers "
"not only expressly laid down in the Treaty but also to be implied from "
"express provisions. An example is where the Unioncan enter "
"international commitments, whenever it has the power to attain an "
"objective within the Union. Another extension of competences comes in "
"via Article 352 (1) TFEU, which states: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛIf action by "
"the Union should prove necessary, within the framework of the policies "
"defined in the Treaties, to attain one of the objectives set out in "
"the Treaties, and the Treaties have not provided the necessary powers, "
"the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and "
"after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, shall adopt "
"the appropriate measures.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>On the other hand, "
"expansion of the competences of the Union, particularly in the field "
"of employment and industrial relations, is constrained by the "
"expressed limitations on its powers, the continuing influence of "
"internal market considerations and the need for political consent. "
"Moreover, according to Article 5 (3) TEU , ΓΆβ‚¬Λin areas "
"which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Union shall act "
"only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot "
"be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level "
"or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale "
"or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union "
"level.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>The competences of the Union in the "
"sphere of employment and industrial relations, therefore, define the "
"potential scope for Europeanisation of employment and industrial "
"relations. The tension between limited competences and pressure to "
"expand the social objectives and action of the Union is a recurring "
"theme in the road towards Europeanisation of employment and industrial "
"relations.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"href=\\collectiveagreementsandworkingconditions.htm\\>Collective "
"agreements</a> between employers and representatives of employees in "

"confronts an established practice of collective bargaining, "

"<h3>Albany case</h3> <p>On 21 September 1999, the European Court of "
"Justice gave its ruling on a case brought by a Dutch textile company. "
"The decision of this apparently minor affair went to the core of the "
"relationship between trade unions and their collective bargaining "
"activities, on the one hand, and the legal framework of the state and "
"European Community institutions on the other. The textile company "
"Albany was trying to exempt itself from a deal between the textile "
"unions and employers in the Netherlands. This established a pension "
"fund system for workers in the industry and had been made compulsory "
"for all companies in that industry by the Dutch Minister of Social "
"Affairs. What made their complaint interesting were the grounds: "
"Albany used the competition rules in Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty "
"(now Article 101(1) TFEU) as a basis for claiming that mandatory "
"affiliation to the pension scheme compromised their "
"competitiveness.</p> <p>The Court in its ruling emphasised the social "
"policy objectives of the Treaty ΓΆβ‚¬β€ which are given "
"equal weight to those on competition (paragraph 54); it focused on the "
"provisions of the EC Treaty (Articles 118 and 118B, now Articles 156 "
"and 154 -155 TFEU) and, in addition and in particular, the provisions "
"in the (then) <a href=\\agreementonsocialpolicy.htm\\>Agreement on "
"Social Policy</a> (Articles 1 and 4, now Articles 151 and 154 TFEU). "
"These provisions explicitly stipulate the objective of social dialogue "
"and collective bargaining between employers and workers, including "
"this objective at EU level (paragraphs 55-58). The "
"CourtΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs conclusion was: (paragraphs 59-60)</p> "
"<p><i>It is beyond question that certain restrictions of competition "
"are inherent in collective agreements between organisations "
"representing employers and workers. However, the social policy "
"objectives pursued by such agreements would be seriously undermined if "
"management and labour were subject to Article 85(1) of the Treaty when "
"seeking jointly to adopt measures to improve conditions of work and "
"employment.</i></p> <p><i>It therefore follows from an interpretation "
"of the provisions of the Treaty as a whole which is both effective and "
"consistent that agreements concluded in the context of collective "
"negotiations between management and labour in pursuit of such "
"objectives must, by virtue of their nature and purpose, be regarded as "
"falling outside the scope of Article 85(1) of the Treaty.</i></p> "
"<p>Insofar as national competition laws increasingly adopt the Union "
"model, it may be that collective agreements within Member States "
"similarly fall outside their scope. Union law may thereby have created "
"an ΓΆβ‚¬Λanti-trust immunityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of collective "
"agreements.</p><br /> <div style=\\font-size: 10px; "

"<br /> <p>Direct complaints to the <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> are "
"possible, but are strictly controlled by the TFEU. There are "
"limitations on who can make a complaint directly to the ECJ, against "
"whom, and on what subjects complaints may be made.</p> <p>Article 259 "
"TFEU provides that a Member State can bring such a complaint directly "
"to the ECJ against another Member State. However, such complaints have "
"been extremely rare. Much more frequent are direct complaints by the "
"European Commission against a Member State. Article 258 TFEU provides "
"that the Commission may bring before the Court of Justice a complaint "
"that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under the "
"Treaty.</p> <p>Those mostly affected by EU law on employment and "
"industrial relations ΓΆβ‚¬β€ employees, trade unions and "
"employers ΓΆβ‚¬β€ cannot normally make a direct complaint "
"to the ECJ. Complaints of violations of employment rights in EU law do "
"not come before the ECJ: they go to national (labour) courts. Claims "
"by employees, trade unions and employers based on EU law will reach "
"the ECJ only indirectly through a procedure whereby the national "
"courts make what is known as a ΓΆβ‚¬Λpreliminary "
"referenceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά under Article 267 TFEU.</p> <p>However, "
"another source of direct complaints to the ECJ is Article 263 TFEU. "
"This is concerned with judicial review by the ECJ of the legality of "
"acts of the EU institutions. Article 263 TFEU makes a distinction "
"between complaints by ΓΆβ‚¬ΛprivilegedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λnon-privilegedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά applicants. The Treaty "
"makes it much easier for ΓΆβ‚¬ΛprivilegedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"applicants (Member States, the EU institutions) to challenge the acts "
"of the EU which are concerned with employment and industrial "
"relations. It is much more difficult for "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λnon-privilegedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά applicants "
"(individuals, employees, employers, trade unions and so on) to "
"complain to the ECJ concerning the legality of acts of these EU "
"institutions.</p> <h3>Intervention rights</h3> <p>Although direct "
"complaints may not be possible, Article 37 of the Statute of the "
"European Court of Justice grants intervention rights to Member States "
"and institutions of the Community in complaints lodged by others. "
"Intervention by others is also provided for: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe same "
"right shall be open to any other person establishing an interest in "
"the result in any case submitted to the Court, save in cases between "
"Member States, between institutions of the Community or between Member "
"States and the institutions of the Community.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> "
"<p>As in the case of direct complaints to the ECJ, there is a question "
"as to whether the European social partners should be treated like all "
"other applicants, and have to establish an interest in each case in "
"order to intervene.</p> "
"<h3>ΓΆβ‚¬ΛNon-privilegedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά applicants</h3> "
"<p>ΓΆβ‚¬ΛNon-privilegedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά applicants, who may "
"include individual employees, employers and trade unions, can directly "
"complain to the European Court of Justice about acts of the EU "
"institutions, but only under certain conditions: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛAny "
"natural or legal person may directly complain against a decision "
"addressed to that person or against a decision which, although in the "
"form of a regulation or a decision addressed to another person, is of "
"direct and individual concern to the formerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article "
"263 TFEU).</p> <p>Although seemingly very wide, the ECJ has "
"interpreted this provision very strictly. In the leading case of "
"<i>Plaumann &amp; Co. v. Commission</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0025:EN:HTML\\>Case "
"25/62</a>, [1963] ECR 95, the ECJ allowed for individuals to complain "
"about EU decisions directly to the ECJ only "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛΓΆβ‚¬Β¦ if that decision affects them by reason "
"of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of "
"circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons "
"and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually just as "
"in the case of the person addressed.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> "
"<p>Specifically, the ECJ has refused to accept that collective "
"organisations representing their members qualify as individually and "
"directly concerned. For example, the ECJ refused to hear two cases "
"where French works councils complained against decisions of the "
"Commission allowing mergers between French companies to proceed "

"Court of Justice</a>, are defined as ΓΆβ‚¬Λa Member State, "
"the European Parliament, the Council or the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 263 TFEU). For example, the "
"United Kingdom complained to the ECJ about the "

"Court of Auditors a right to bring action before the Court of Justice, "
"but only for the purpose of protecting its prerogatives.</p> "
"<p>Finally, the <a href=\\treatyofnice.htm\\>Treaty of Nice</a> added "

"list of privileged applicants. This raises the possibility that the EU "
"social partners could also claim to be "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛprivilegedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά applicants by an "
"interpretation or revision of Article 263 TFEU. Articles 154-155 TFEU "
"require the Commission to consult management and labour, which may "
"initiate the social dialogue. In turn, the dialogue may lead to "
"agreements, which shall be implemented. The case law on "
"ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs rights under Article 263 TFEU was "
"developed before the Maastricht Social Policy Agreement had provided "
"for the European social partners to participate in the making of EU "
"social and labour legislation. The Court then regarded the "
"institutional balance in the EU as requiring that the prerogatives of "
"the European Parliament be respected, first, allowing Parliament to "
"challenge acts, which threaten its prerogatives, and second, "
"acknowledging that these prerogatives included the right to "
"participate in the legislative process.</p> <p>The European social "
"partners could use litigation under Article 263 TFEU in a number of "
"specific disputes arising under the social dialogue procedure. For "
"example, the EU social partners may complain that the consultation by "
"the Commission either did not take place or was inadequate "
"(procedurally or substantively). Or the EU social partners may "
"complain if the Commission submits to the Council a proposal, or the "
"Council makes a decision, which deviates from the agreement reached by "
"the social partners. Finally, if the European social partners were "

"ΓΆβ‚¬Λfor the purpose of protecting their "

"2002/14</a> states that the ΓΆβ‚¬Λpractical arrangements for "
"information and consultationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, must be such "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λas to ensure their effectivenessΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. "
"Article 4(4)(a) stipulates that the quality of the consultation "
"required is measured against a criterion of what is "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛappropriateΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛAppropriatenessΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛeffectivenessΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά are the overriding "
"criteria in EC law to assess the practical arrangements determined by "
"Member States.</p> <p>The ΓΆβ‚¬ΛmethodΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of "
"consultation includes, for example, meetings, feedback and advice from "
"experts. The reference in Article 4(4)(d) to ΓΆβ‚¬Λmeet the "
"employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is not limited to one meeting. Article "
"4(4)(c) provides for ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe opinion which the "
"employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representatives are entitled to "
"formulateΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά on the basis of the information supplied "
"by the employer. Article 4(4)(d) obliges employers to offer a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λreasoned responseΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά to the comments of "
"the employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representatives concerning the "
"employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs proposals. If the "
"employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representatives propose alternative "
"options, the employer needs to respond to them and justify any "
"rejection of these options. The method of consultation envisaged by "
"the directive thus opens room for a proactive approach by "
"employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representatives; not only to react to the "
"employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs proposals, but to formulate their own. "
"Article 4(3) describes their activity in terms of conducting an "
"adequate study in preparation for consultation. Article 6(1) also "
"provides that employee representatives may benefit from "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λexperts who assist themΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in the "
"process of information and consultation of decision-making in the "

"<p>Decision-making in the enterprise is required to proceed through a "
"process of consultation with employee representatives under <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0014:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive No. 2002/14</a> establishing a framework for informing "
"employees and consulting with them in the European Community. Article "
"4 states that ΓΆβ‚¬ΛΓΆβ‚¬Β¦ Consultation shall take "
"placeΓΆβ‚¬Β¦ with a view to reaching an agreement on decisions "
"within the scope of the employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs powers referred to "
"in paragraph 2(c).ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά The latter refers to "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λinformation and consultation on decisions likely to "
"lead to substantial changes in work organisation or in contractual "
"relationsΓΆβ‚¬Β¦.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>This seems to "
"indicate that some matters require consultation, but not consultation "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λwith a view to reaching an agreement.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"These other matters are specified as information on the recent and "
"probable development of the undertakingΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs or the "
"establishmentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs activities and economic situation; "
"and information and consultation on the situation, structure and "
"probable development of employment and on any anticipatory measures "
"envisaged, in particular where there is a threat to employment.</p> "
"<p>This raises the question as to whether there are two types of "
"consultation: dialogue with a view to reaching an agreement on some "
"matters, not so on other matters. However, the scope referred to in "
"Article 4(2)(c) is that of the employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs powers to "
"make substantial changes in work organisation or in contractual "
"relations. These powers of the employer will affect almost any matter "
"of concern to the workforce. So long as the decision in question is "
"within the scope of the employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs powers referred to "
"in paragraph 2(c), it can be argued that it must be made in "
"consultation with a view to reaching an agreement with "
"employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representatives.</p> <p>Consultation of "
"employee representatives in the enterprise in accordance with <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0014:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"2002/14</a> with a view to reaching an agreement is now a legally "
"structured process. It includes the transmission to them of necessary "
"information/data, acquaintance with and examination of this data, "
"conduct of an adequate study, preparation for consultation, "
"formulation of an opinion, meeting with the relevant level of "
"management, a reasoned response by the employer to the opinion "
"formulated by the representatives, an ΓΆβ‚¬Λexchange of views "
"and establishment of dialogueΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, discussion "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λwith a view to reaching an agreement on "
"decisionsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and, finally, ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe employer "
"and the employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representatives shall work in a "
"spirit of cooperation and with due regard for their reciprocal rights "
"and obligations, taking into account the interests both of the "
"undertaking or establishment and of the employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. "
"This is significant since the obligation to ΓΆβ‚¬Λwork in a "
"spirit of cooperation ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά applies not only in the "
"definition of practical arrangements, but during their operation in "
"practice.</p> <p>This obligation to ΓΆβ‚¬Λwork in a spirit of "
"cooperationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά applies not only in the definition of "
"practical arrangements, but during their operation in practice. For "
"employers, for example, failure to inform and consult with respect to "
"decisions on dismissal could require the measures and sanctions "
"required by Article 8, which could prevent the decision being "
"implemented, at least until the employer has fulfilled his obligation "
"to work in a spirit of cooperation. Thus, it could develop into "
"something similar to a ΓΆβ‚¬Λstatus quoΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"clause in a collective agreement, which precludes unilateral action by "
"the employer to change working conditions. For employee "
"representatives, a breach of the obligation could raise the prospect "
"of claims for compensation if the process of information and "
"consultation is delayed, or the results are unsatisfactory as a result "
"of the alleged failure to cooperate. Similarly, a court might hold "
"that any industrial action violated the spirit of cooperation required "
"during the information and consultation process. Thus, the obligation "
"could develop into something parallel to a ΓΆβ‚¬Λpeace "
"obligationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (a no-strike clause) in a collective "
"agreement.</p> <h3>Relevant level</h3> <p><i>Council Directive No. "
"2002/14, establishing a framework for informing employees and "
"consulting with them in the European Community stipulates that "
"consultation shall take place ΓΆβ‚¬Λat the relevant level of "
"management and representation, depending on the subject under "
"discussionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</i></p> <p>As to the relevant level of "
"management, Article 4(4)(e) states that consultation is "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λwith a view to reaching an agreement on decisions "
"within the scope of the employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs powers referred to "
"in paragraph 2(c).ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά The question is whether this is "
"the formal decision-maker (e.g. the employer ΓΆβ‚¬Λin "
"contractual relationsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά with the employees concerned) "
"or the ΓΆβ‚¬ΛrealΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά decision-maker (e.g. the "
"employer whose ΓΆβ‚¬Λdecisions are likely to lead to "
"substantial changes in work organisationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά). If "
"consultation is intended to influence decisions, it must be with the "
"employer who makes the decision at the relevant level "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ for example, either the contractual employer or the "
"employer in a parent company. The Directive refers not to the relevant "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛemployerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, but to ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe "
"relevant level of management.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>As to the "
"relevant level of employee (collective) representation, there is no "
"reason to confine the obligation to one level of "
"employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representatives. The impact of the "
"decision may be felt at many levels, and practical arrangements should "
"require information and consultation at these relevant levels. In any "
"event, the relevant level of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛrepresentationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά does at least "
"presuppose representation. This puts to rest any doubts about whether "
"the Directive allows for consultation of individual employees.</p> "
"<h3>Timing</h3> <p>The timing of consultation in the enterprise is "
"critical. Studies have confirmed the importance for employee "
"representatives of early access to the decision-making process and a "
"predetermined decision-making procedure. <a "

"Moreover, the ECJ held that the Directive obliges the employer to "
"complete consultations before the decision is made. Again, by "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛdecisionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is meant the date of the "

"<br /> <p>Coordination of collective bargaining at European level is "
"the consequence of a political rationale resulting from the European "
"Monetary Union and aims to counter downward pressure on wage costs. In "
"particular, the objective of cross-border bargaining coordination "
"consists in avoiding competitive bargaining strategies of national "
"trade unions. According to the report <a "

"at European level parallels the coordinated national bargaining "

"bargaining coordination can take place at inter-regional as well as at "
"sectoral level. In 1997, the European MetalworkersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"Federation (EMF) was the first <a "
"href=\\europeanindustryfederations.htm\\>European industry "
"federation</a> to develop a policy of <a "
"href=\\sectoralcoordinationofcollectivebargaining.htm\\>sectoral "
"coordination of collective bargaining</a>. The EMFΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"initiative provided a template for developments in other sectors of "
"the economy and also for initiatives of the European Trade Union "
"Confederation (<a href=\\etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>).</p> <p>In 1999, ETUC "
"set up a ΓΆβ‚¬Λcommittee for the coordination of collective "
"bargainingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in order to draw up guidelines on the "
"coordination of collective bargaining, with three main objectives:</p> "
"<ol> <li>To allow trade unions at European level to provide a general "
"indication of wage bargaining developments in response to the European "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs broad economic policy guidelines and the "
"European Central Bank (<a "
"href=\\http://www.ecb.int/home/html/index.en.html\\>ECB</a>) "
"guidelines, and generally to influence the <a "
"href=\\macroeconomicdialogue.htm\\>macroeconomic dialogue</a> at "
"European level;</li> <li>To avoid situations which may lead to social "
"and ΓΆβ‚¬Λwage dumpingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and wage divergence "
"in Europe;</li> <li>To coordinate wage claims in Europe, and "
"especially in countries that form part of the eurozone, and to "
"encourage an ΓΆβ‚¬Λupward convergenceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of "
"living standards in Europe.</li> </ol> <p>The guidelines contain a "
"formula for pay claims:</p> <ul> <li>nominal wage increases should at "
"least exceed inflation, while maximising the proportion of "
"productivity allocated to the rise in gross wages in order to secure a "
"better balance between profits and wages;</li> <li>any remaining part "
"of productivity should be used to fund other aspects in collective "
"agreements, such as ΓΆβ‚¬Λqualitative aspects of work, where "
"these are quantifiable and calculable in terms of "
"costΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</li> </ul> <p>ETUC has continued to be active "
"in the area of collective bargaining coordination over the past "
"decade. In December 2009, for example, it issued a <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/IMG/pdf_01-02-2009Resolution-EN-No-to-wages-freezes-and-wage-cuts.pdf\\>resolution "
"(85Kb PDF)</a> on the coordination of collective bargaining for 2010, "
"in the context of the crisis. In this resolution, it urges trade "
"unions in Europe to resist wage freezes and wage cuts, maintaining "
"that this will kill a fragile recovery. It also urges trade unions to "
"resist wage cuts in line with falls in productivity, arguing that this "
"is a temporary and cyclical phenomenon. It argues for wage bargaining "
"that reflects productivity trends and medium-term inflation.</p> "
"<p>With regard to bargaining coordination at inter-regional level, the "
"best known example is probably the <a href=\\doorngroup.htm\\>Doorn "
"group</a>. This represents a cross-sectoral initiative bringing "
"together trade union confederations and major sectoral trade unions "
"from the Benelux countries and Germany. Data collection into a "
"database enabled progress to be monitored in all involved countries. "
"This is widely seen as a pioneer in terms of European collective "
"bargaining coordination. The Doorn initiative was also influential in "
"stimulating the ETUC in building cross-border bargaining coordination "
"across the wider EU. For this purpose, the ETUC supports the "
"establishment of inter-regional trade union councils (IRTUC) in areas "
"where economic, territorial, monetary and social conditions are "
"similar.</p> <p>There are also a number of examples of sectoral "
"cross-border trade union cooperation, resulting in texts and "
"agreements. These are mostly to be found in the metalworking and "
"construction sectors. For example, the European Metalworkers "
"Federation (EMF, now part of <a "
"href=\\industrialleurope.htm\\>IndustriAll Europe</a>) first agreed on "
"a ΓΆβ‚¬Λwage normΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά for the metalworking "
"industry in 1998 at its collective bargaining conference in Frankfurt "
"(<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/1998/12/feature/de9812283f.htm\\>DE9812283F</a>). "
"The aim was to strengthen collective bargaining coordination between "
"trade unions in different European countries and to prevent a downward "
"wage spiral in the context of increased globalisation and the "
"introduction of the euro single currency, which was a particular "
"preoccupation at that time.</p> <p>This formed the basis for the "
"development of a collective bargaining network involving four European "
"trade union industry federations ΓΆβ‚¬β€ <a "
"href=\\http://www.eucoban.eu/\\>Eucoban</a> ΓΆβ‚¬β€ which "
"provides unions in the metalworking, chemicals, textiles, and food, "
"agriculture and tourism sectors with information on bargaining in "
"individual European countries. A joint website for the relevant "
"European industry federations aims to strengthen the visibility and "
"impact of trade union collective bargaining at European level.However, "
"a major problem with the European trade unionsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"policy of coordination of collective bargaining is that, so far, this "
"is a wholly unilateral initiative, based on <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/crossbordertradeunioncooperation.htm\\>cross-border "
"trade union cooperation</a>. There is no evidence of an <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/employer.htm\\>employer</a> "
"response to engage with such an exercise in wages, or any other form "
"of coordination. As with the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeansocialdialogue.htm\\>European "
"social dialogue</a>, the question for trade unions is how they can "
"stimulate an employer response that will help them to achieve the goal "
"of developing an operational EU industrial relations system of "
"coordinated collective bargaining.</p> <p>Difficulties also arise from "
"the different <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/collectivebargaining.htm\\>collective "
"bargaining</a> systems found across Europe. One particular challenge, "
"for example, is that of applying policies of sectoral coordination of "
"collective bargaining in countries with single employer-based "
"bargaining systems. In general, trade union strategies to coordinate "
"bargaining at the sectoral level have to face the growing importance "
"of company level bargaining in most EU Member States. As a "
"consequence, the implementation of the objectives of bargaining "
"coordination at EU level becomes more complicated.</p> <p>Another "
"problem with cross-border bargaining coordination is enforceability. "
"As the coordination initiatives are essentially voluntary, compliance "
"is largely dependent on trade unionsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά voluntary "
"commitment to adhere to agreed positions.</p> <p><b>See also:</b> <a "

"of 25 October 2011, <i>A renewed EU strategy 2011-14 for Corporate "

"the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p> <p>On its <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=331&amp;langId=en\\>website</a>, "
"the European Commission states further that CSR ΓΆβ‚¬Λrefers "
"to companies voluntarily going beyond what the law requires to achieve "
"social and environmental objectives during the course of their daily "
"business activities. It covers a range of areas: Europe 2020 "
"(especially new skills and jobs, youth, local development); business "
"and human rights; CSR Reporting; and socially responsible public "
"procurementΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Overall, the term CSR is used to "
"describe various kinds and degrees of obligation undertaken by "
"enterprises. The CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 2011 Communication "
"states, for example, that CSR should include human rights, labour and "
"employment practices (such as training, diversity, <a "
"href=\\genderequality.htm\\>gender equality</a> and employee health "
"and well-being), environmental issues, and combating bribery and "
"corruption.</p> <p>There has been some debate in recent years "
"concerning the degree of obligation that CSR imposes on employers. The "
"2006 Communication launched the <a "
"href=\\http://www.csreurope.org/pages/en/alliance.html\\>European "
"Alliance for Corporate Social Responsibility</a>, which is designed to "
"encourage enterprises to voluntarily commit to the principles of CSR. "
"The alliance has set itself three targets: raising awareness and "
"knowledge of CSR, mainstreaming and developing coalitions and "
"cooperation as well as creating a supportive environment for CSR.</p> "
"<p>However, reacting to the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 2006 "
"Communication, the European Parliament issued a <a "
"href=\\http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A6-2006-0471+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN\\>report</a> "
"on CSR in March 2007, which questions the validity of only supporting "
"a voluntary approach towards CSR, arguing that companies should be "
"encouraged to produce an annual CSR report.</p> <p>The "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 2011 Communication does not introduce "
"mandatory reporting, but does make a commitment to monitor the "
"commitments made by European enterprises with more than 1,000 "
"employees to take account of internationally recognised CSR principles "
"and guidelines.</p> <p>The <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/accession.htm\\>accession</a> "
"of many new Member States, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, "
"has involved the development of new policy initiatives. One such "
"initiative is an EU-funded project, <a "
"href=\\http://www.acceleratingcsr.eu/en/\\>Accelerating CSR in New "
"Europe</a>, which is based on the premise that the social aspects of "
"change have not always been prominent in Central and Eastern Europe as "
"countries move towards a free market economy. Central to the project "
"is the notion that ΓΆβ‚¬Λcross-sectoral cooperation and "
"social dialogue between various stakeholdersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά can "
"help to demonstrate the importance of CSR.</p> <p>A report from the "
"European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working "
"Conditions (Eurofound), <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2008/102/en/2/EF08102EN.pdf\\>European "
"and international framework agreements: Practical experiences and "
"strategic approaches</a> (2009) provides evidence to indicate that the "
"increasing emergence of European Framework and International Framework "
"Agreements (EF/IFAs) are helping to promote CSR. The report claims "
"that such agreements are viewed by management as an integral part of "
"good CSR practices:</p> <p>According to the report, in addition to "
"promoting positive publicity as well as representing a platform for "
"entering into social dialogue with employees, CSR and EF/IFAs serve "
"companies in another important way, that of ΓΆβ‚¬Λrisk "
"managementΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. This third factor involves an awareness "
"that the internationalisation of business brings with it certain "
"dangers, particularly a potential lack of transparency. While "
"multinationals are keen to advocate a degree of decentralisation, the "
"need to ensure that local management decisions do not undermine the "
"companyΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs CSR objectives nevertheless prevails.</p> "
"<p>The most recent overview of national public CSR policies in the EU "
"is contained in a Commission <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=6716&amp;langId=en\\>report</a> "
"issued in April 2011.</p> <p>The EU-level social partners have also "

"sectoral agreements on CSR having been concluded in recent years in "
"sectors such as the electricity sector, the postal sector, the "
"commerce sector, the banking sector, the hospitality sector and the "
"sugar industry.</p> <p>In terms of the future, the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 2011 Communication contains a range of "
"actions that the Commission intends to carry out between 2011 and 2014 "
"in order to promote CSR. This is based on the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs view that, despite progress made in "
"recent years, a number of challenges remain. For example, many EU "
"companies have not yet fully integrated social and environmental "
"concerns into their operations and core strategy, there are "
"accusations that a small minority of European enterprises harm human "
"rights and fail to respect core labour standards, and only 15 out of "
"the 27 EU Member States have national policy frameworks to promote "
"CSR.</p><br /> <div style=\\font-size: 10px; font-family:Verdana, "

"        <p>The Council of the European Union (the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛCouncil of MinistersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά or the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛCouncilΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά) is the Union\\'s main "
"decision-making institution. It is composed of\\n"
"        the ministers of the Member States and thus constitutes the EU "
"institution in which the governments of the Member States are "
"represented. The Council,\\n"
"        together with the <a href=\\europeanparliament.htm\\>European "
"Parliament</a>, acts in a legislative and budgetary capacity. It is "
"also the lead\\n"
"        institution for decision-making on the common foreign and "
"security policy (CFSP), and on the coordination of economic policies "
"(intergovernmental\\n"
"        approach). The Council\\'s headquarters are in Brussels, where "
"it meets several times a month (in certain months, the meetings are "
"held in\\n"
"        Luxembourg).</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Articles 202-210 EC set out the various roles and functions "
"of the Council. About 20 different Councils of Ministers bring "
"together ministers from\\n"
"        the Member States depending on the area of activity "
"(transport, energy, etc). The General Affairs Council deals with "
"external relations plus general\\n"
"        policy, while Ecofin deals with economic and financial "
"matters. Employment and industrial relations are dealt with in the "
"Labour and Social Affairs\\n"
"        Council.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Each Member State in turn presides over the Council for six "
"months. Decisions are prepared by the Committee of Permanent "
"Representatives of the\\n"
"        Member States (<a href=\\coreper.htm\\>Coreper</a>), assisted "
"by working parties of national government officials. The Presidency, "
"which rotates among\\n"
"        Member States every six months, is responsible for arranging "
"meetings, setting the agenda, developing initiatives, and liaising "
"with the Commission and\\n"
"        the Parliament, international bodies and governments around "
"the world. The Presidency of the Council, therefore, has an important "
"role in determining\\n"
"        the priority to be given to employment and industrial "
"relations matters by the Council, and in achieving progress, or lack "
"of it, of the EU in this\\n"
"        policy area.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>In most cases, the Council, acting on a proposal from the "
"<a href=\\europeancommission.htm\\>European Commission</a>, decides "
"jointly with the\\n"
"        European Parliament under the co-decision procedure. Depending "
"on the subject, the Council takes decisions by simple majority, "
"qualified majority or\\n"
"        unanimously. In most cases, however, it acts by a qualified "
"majority (agriculture, single market, environment, transport, "
"employment, health, etc).</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The CouncilΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs legislative role is most "
"important, though it shares this role with the European Parliament. "
"The Council adopts legislative proposals\\n"
"        put forward by the Commission. It can also request that the "
"Commission prepare legislative proposals (it is estimated that 25% of "
"Commission proposals\\n"
"        originate in such requests) and delegate legislative power to "
"the Commission in areas where specific detailed rules are needed "
"(subject to approval by\\n"

"process known as <a href=\\comitology.htm\\>comitology</a>.</p>\\n"

"Member States. Each State will hold the Presidency for a period of six "
"months, assisted\\n"

"addition, the General Affairs Council will be chaired by the Minister "

"<br /> <p>In executing its various powers and roles, the <a "
"href=\\counciloftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Council of the European "
"Union</a> has three different voting systems: majority, qualified "
"majority and unanimity. The choice of the voting procedure in the "
"Council often determines the evolution of EU policy in the fields of "
"employment and industrial relations.</p> <p>Unanimity requires all "
"Member States to agree in order for a proposal to be adopted. This "
"requirement was, for many matters, governed by the intergovernmental "
"second (foreign and security policy) and third (police and judicial "
"cooperation) pillars of the Treaty on European Union. Abstention does "
"not prevent adoption of an act by unanimity (Article 238(4) TFEU).</p> "
"<p>The <a href=\\singleeuropeanact.htm\\>Single European Act</a> "
"limited the application of the unanimity requirement and voting by "

"href=\\qualifiedmajorityvoting.htm\\>qualified majority voting</a> "
"(QMV) to other areas, as this was deemed necessary to enable proposals "
"to be adopted in an enlarged European Union of 25 Member States. "
"Although 27 new provisions were to move in whole or in part from "
"unanimity to QMV, these did not include all social policy issues. "
"Unanimity is still required for the Council to adopt proposals "

"<li>social security and social protection of workers;</li> "
"<li>protection of workers where their employment contract is "

"interests of workers and employers, including co-determination;</li> "
"<li>conditions of employment for third country nationals legally "
"residing in Community territory.</li> </ul> <p>However, the Treaty of "
"Nice did provide that the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal "
"from the Commission, may decide to apply the QMV procedure to the last "
"three items above (Article 137(2) EC/now 153 (2)TFEU ).</p> <p>In a "
"decision under QMV, votes in the Council are weighted in accordance "

"<br /> <p>Data protection refers to limits on the processing and use "
"of personal data. This includes data about employees, such as personal "
"health records, and data created or used by employees in emails or "
"internet use. Two Directives provide the framework for general EU "
"regulation in this area, though they are not specifically concerned "
"with the workplace: <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"95/46/EC</a> concerning the protection of individuals with regard to "

"97/66/EC</a> concerning the processing of personal data and the "
"protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector. The Commission "
"has also initiated consultations with the social partners on the topic "
"of data protection at the workplace, for various reasons. First, the "
"principle of consent, which applies to data processing as regulated in "
"the two general Directives, may not be adequate in the individual "
"employment context as between employer and employee. Second, the "
"processing of specific medical data in the employment context carries "
"with it the need for elaborate protection both as to the quantity to "
"be made available and the uses to which it may be put. A case is the "
"use of drug and genetic testing, authorised by legislation in many "
"Member States when related to employee assessments of fitness for "
"work, the results of which are collected and processed. Third, "
"monitoring of employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά email and their use of the "
"internet use is regulated in some Member States, but there is not a "
"consistent EU-wide practice: the Commission proposes an EU level "
"framework to meet the need.</p> <p>The Commission has proposed in 2012 "
"a new text which will in term replace Directive 95/46/EC and will be "
"applicable within the 27 member states (28 in July 2013). The proposed "
"Regulation is being debated within the European Parliament and the "

"<br /> <p>Decent work is a term originally coined by the <a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm\\>International "
"Labour Organisation</a> (ILO) in a <a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/dgo/speeches/somavia/1999/seattle.htm\\>report</a> "
"published in June 1999, when it described the goal of <a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/ilc/ilc87/rep-i.htm\\>decent "
"work</a> as ΓΆβ‚¬Λnot just the creation of jobs, but also the "
"creation of jobs of acceptable qualityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. It made it "
"clear that the level of employment (quantity) cannot be divorced from "
"its quality. The ILO report recognised that all societies had a notion "
"of decent work, but that the quality of employment could mean many "
"things. It could relate to different forms of work, and also to "
"different conditions of work, as well as feelings of value and "
"satisfaction. The ILO saw the need to devise social and economic "
"systems that ensured basic security and employment while remaining "
"capable of adaptation to rapidly changing circumstances in a highly "
"competitive global market. For the ILO, decent work lies at the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λheart of social progressΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and has thus "
"become one of its major strategic policy concepts.</p> <p>The decent "
"work agenda is defined as being based on an integrated and "
"gender-mainstreamed approach consisting of four pillars, which "
"are:</p> <ul> <li>productive and freely chosen work;</li> <li>rights "
"at work;</li> <li>social protection;</li> <li>social dialogue.</li> "
"</ul> <p>In 2007, the ILO, in response to the adoption by the United "
"Nations of a Ministerial declaration on <a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/decent-work/lang--en/index.htm\\>full "
"and productive employment and decent work</a>, stated that this would "
"help strengthen efforts by the UN and the multilateral system aimed at "
"creating jobs, cutting poverty and providing new hope for the "
"worldΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 1.4 billion working poor during the next "
"decade. A UN Summit in September 2006 had affirmed that fair "
"globalisation and decent work for all were fundamental objectives in "
"both national and international policies, as well as development "
"strategies.</p> <p>In 2008, the ILO adopted its <a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---cabinet/documents/publication/wcms_099766.pdf\\>Declaration "
"on social justice for a fair globalisation</a>, in which it stresses "
"its key role in helping to achieve progress and social justice in the "
"context of globalisation, through the decent work agenda. This is the "
"third major statement of principles and policies adopted by the "
"International Labour Conference since the ILOΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"Constitution of 1919.</p> <p>The European Commission, in a 2006 "
"Communication, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2006/com2006_0249en01.pdf\\>Promoting "
"decent work in the world</a>, noted that half the "
"worldΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs workers earn less than two US dollars a day "
"and that the concept of decent work for all is a way of tackling these "
"inequalities. The Communication thus aimed to go beyond just ensuring "
"minimum labour rights, and gave a clear indication as to how promoting "
"decent work could be achieved: through the promotion of job creation; "
"through improved governance and social dialogue; by identifying and "
"addressing decent work deficits; by better cooperation between the "
"main stakeholders; and by reducing corruption. The Communication also "
"stated that there was a business case for decent work as it had been "
"proven to contribute to improved economic performance. On 1 December "
"2006, the European Council endorsed the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"proposals to strengthen EU policies, actions and programmes aimed at "
"promoting decent work, both inside and outside the EU.</p> <p>Decent "
"work can be measured through statistical indicators which the "
"Commission recommends could include intrinsic job quality, skills and "
"<a href=\\lifelonglearning.htm\\>lifelong learning</a>, <a "
"href=\\genderequality.htm\\>gender equality</a>, <a "

"performance. The Commission is also committed to emphasising the need "
"for decent work in its agreements and cooperation with countries "
"outside the EU, including candidate, neighbouring, developing and "
"developed countries. Most recently, in October 2011, the European "
"Commission issued a Communication entitled <a "

"<br /> <p>Direct effect is a principle of EU law. It applies to those "
"aspects of EU law that are enforceable directly by Union citizens in "
"their own Member State, regardless of whether the Member State has "
"introduced specific national laws to implement the provisions. It can "
"apply in relation to regulations, directives, Treaty provisions and "
"decisions. The term ΓΆβ‚¬Λdirect effectΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά was "
"first used by the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European "
"Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) when it attributed to specific Treaty "
"articles the legal quality of ΓΆβ‚¬Λdirect "
"effectΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in the case of <i>NV Algemene Transporten "
"Expeditie Onderneming van Gend en Loos v. Nederlandse Administratie "
"der Belastingen</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML\\>Case "
"26/62</a> [1963]. In this case, the ECJ identified three situations "
"necessary to establish direct effect of primary EU law. These are:</p> "
"<ul> <li>the provision must be sufficiently clear and precisely "
"stated;</li> <li>it must be unconditional and not dependent on any "
"other legal provision;</li> <li>it must confer a specific right upon "
"which a citizen can base a claim.</li> </ul> <p>If these conditions "
"are met, provisions of the Treaties can be given the same legal effect "
"as Regulations under <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E249:EN:HTML\\>Article "
"288</a> TFEU. However, there is little legislation on employment and "
"industrial relations to be found other than in the primary law and in "
"the Regulations concerning the free movement of workers.</p> <p>By "
"virtue of the doctrine of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/supremacyofeclaw.htm\\>supremacy "
"of EU law</a>, provisions of Community law with ΓΆβ‚¬Λdirect "
"effectΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά take precedence over domestic laws "
"(<i>Flaminio Costa v. ENEL</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61964J0006:EN:HTML\\>Case "
"6/64</a>, [1964]). EU labour law rules take precedence over national "
"labour law rules.</p> <p>Taken together, the principles of direct "
"effect and supremacy mean that Treaty provisions may be used to make "
"claims before domestic courts and override domestic law. Probably the "
"best-known example is <i>Defrenne v. Sabena</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61975J0043:EN:HTML\\>Case "
"43/75</a>, [1976], where the European Court decided that: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe principle that women and men should receive equal "
"pay, which is laid down by Article [141 EC now 157 TFEU], may be "
"relied on before the national courts. These courts have a duty to "
"ensure the protection of the rights, which that provision vests in "
"individualsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. In the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/vikingcase.htm\\>Viking "
"case</a> (Case C-43805), <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002M043:EN:HTML\\>Article "
"43</a> EC (now Article 49 TFEU) is interpreted as capable of "
"conferring rights on a private undertaking that may be relied on "
"against a trade union or an association of trade unions. In <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:051:0009:0010:EN:PDF\\>the "
"Laval Case</a> (Case C-341/05), <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E049:EN:HTML\\>Article "
"49</a> EC (now Article 56 TFEU) was held to have direct effect, so "
"that Member States must modify national laws that restrict any freedom "
"incompatible with the TreatyΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs principles.</p> "
"<p>Most EU law on employment and industrial relations takes the form "
"of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/directives.htm\\>directives</a>. "
"According to <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E249:EN:HTML\\>Article "
"288 TFEU</a>: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛA directive shall be binding, as to the "
"result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is "
"addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of "
"form and methods,ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά The decision of the European Court "
"to extend the principle of direct effect to directives, therefore, was "
"of crucial importance.</p> <p>The rationale for attributing direct "
"effect to directives was to secure the ΓΆβ‚¬Λuseful "
"effectΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (<i>effet utile</i>) of EU legislation. Since "
"EU law was a new transnational legal order capable of conferring "
"rights on individuals, an interpretation of <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E249:EN:HTML\\>Article "
"249</a> EC(now Article 288 TFEU) was developed, which emphasised the "
"binding result to be achieved by Directives, rather than, as stated by "
"Article 288TFEU, leaving ΓΆβ‚¬Λto the national authorities "
"the choice of form and methodsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Direct effect "
"can apply both horizontally and vertically, with the distinction based "
"on who the right is being enforced against and the nature of the right "
"itself. Where rights conferred by a Directive are being violated by "

"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/verticaldirecteffect.htm\\>vertical "
"direct effect</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Vertical direct effect concerns "
"the relationship between EU law and national law and the "
"stateΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs obligation to ensure its legislation is "

"<br /> <p>Directives are a form of legal measure enacted by the EU "
"institutions, and are widely used in various areas. Article 288 TFEU "
"provides: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛA directive shall be binding, as to the "
"result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is "
"addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of "
"form and methods.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>Most of the EU law on "
"employment and industrial relations is contained in EU directives. "
"Member States are obliged to achieve the aims contained within a "
"directive by a stipulated date. Failure to implement a directive or "
"implementation in part only or incorrect implementation often leads to "
"a complaint by the Commission to the European Court of Justice "
"(Article 258 TFEU).</p> <p>Additionally, invoking the need to achieve "
"effectiveness of EU law (<i>effet utile</i>), the European Court has "
"decided that individuals may make claims in national courts for rights "
"provided in directives under certain conditions: where the individual "
"rights specified in the directive are clear, precise and "
"unconditional, and the right is being violated by the state or an "
"emanation of the state (<a href=\\verticaldirecteffect.htm\\>vertical "
"direct effect</a>). Directives in the field of employment and "
"industrial relations, therefore, may confer directly enforceable "
"rights on employees of the State. However, the Court has refused to "
"extend the <a href=\\directeffect.htm\\>direct effect</a> of "
"directives to allow for claims by individuals against other private "
"individuals, including private employers (<a "
"href=\\horizontaldirecteffect.htm\\>horizontal direct effect</a>).</p> "
"<p>Public employees in EU labour law thus retain the considerable "
"advantage of being able to rely directly on provisions in EU "
"directives as well as on national legislation. The scope of the "
"definition of the state has the result that a considerable proportion "
"of the national workforce is in this fortunate position. The potential "
"scope of the definition of ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a "
"href=\\emanationsofthestate.htm\\>emanations of the "
"state</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in EU law may include privatised "
"industries or services. The legal form of the body is irrelevant, so "
"long as it is responsible for providing a public service under the "
"control of the state and has, for that purpose, special powers.</p> "
"<p>Despite this, the legal force of directives conferring rights on "
"individuals remains limited by the exclusion of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λhorizontal direct effectΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, and the "
"insistence of the European Court on the exclusively "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛverticalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά responsibility of the state "
"for implementation of EU directives, even where EU law imposes "
"responsibilities on private employers. The <i>effet utile</i> "
"rationale for direct effect may support a legal remedy also where "
"private employers fail to respect provisions of EU directives, which "
"should be effective.</p> <p>The discrepancy between employees of the "
"state and employees of private employers in terms of their ability to "
"claim rights under directives according to the doctrine of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛverticalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά direct effect has been "
"partly remedied by other legal doctrines developed by the European "
"Court of Justice.</p> <p>The European CourtΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"doctrine of <a href=\\indirecteffect.htm\\>indirect effect</a> "
"achieves indirectly, through the technique of judicial interpretation "
"of domestic law, the result obtainable through the doctrine of direct "
"effect: national courts are required to interpret their national law "
"so far as possible, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the "
"directive in order to achieve the result required by the directive "
"(<i>Von Colson and Kamann v. Land Nordhein-Westfalen</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;numdoc=61983J0014&amp;lg=en\\>Case "
"14/83</a>, (1984) ECR 1891). However, this result is obtainable as far "
"as the national law is not wholly inconsistent with Community law.</p> "
"<p>The principle of state responsibility has potentially far-reaching "
"implications for the enforcement of EU labour law. If an individual "
"has a definable interest protected by the directive, failure by the "
"state to act to protect that interest may lead to state liability, "
"where the individual suffers damage, provided causation can be "
"demonstrated. The Directives on health and safety at work, on equal "
"treatment of women and men, and an increasing number of Directives "
"regulating individual and collective interests of workers are cases "
"where non-compliance with EU law may lead to state liability.</p> "
"<p>Collective agreements are a mechanism for implementing EU "
"Directives in the field of employment and industrial relations. "
"Compared to administrative officials or judges, the social partners "
"are much less remote from the site of enforcement of labour law. Their "
"proximity means that they have the potential to be effective "
"guarantors of the application of the rules. Recognition of the role of "
"collective agreements in implementing directives was established in "

"\\n"
"        <p>By using the concept of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛdisabilityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in Article 1 of the "
"directive, the legislature deliberately chose a term that differs from "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛsicknessΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The\\n"
"        implication is that the two concepts cannot be treated as "
"being the same.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>According to Article 5 of Directive 2000/78/EC, reasonable "
"accommodation for disabled persons shall be provided in order to "

"\\n"

"\\n"
"        <p>The ECJ ruling in the <i>ChacΓƒΒ³n</i> case interprets "
"that the importance attached to measures to adapt the workplace to the "

"        that the Community legislation envisaged situations in which "
"participation in professional life is hindered over a long period of "
"time. However, the\\n"
"        directive does not indicate that workers are protected against "
"discrimination on grounds of disability in cases of sickness and based "
"on these\\n"
"        considerations, the ECJ decided that a person that has been "
"dismissed by her/his employer solely on the grounds of sickness did "
"not fall within the\\n"
"        general framework laid down for combating discrimination on "
"grounds of disability by Directive 2000/78/EC<i>.</i></p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Rights to protection against discrimination on the grounds "
"of disability were further strengthened through the signing, on 30 "
"March 2007, of a UN\\n"
"        treaty on disability rights by the European Community. The <a "
"href=\\http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/rights/convtexte.htm\\>Convention "
"on the rights\\n"
"        of persons with disabilities</a> recognises, at an "
"international level, that disability is a human rights issue. The text "
"of the Convention recognises\\n"
"        the obligation to make ΓΆβ‚¬Λreasonable "
"accommodationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά a principle also established under <a "
"href=\\n"
"        "
"\\http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/news/2001/jul/directive78ec_en.pdf\\>Directive "
"2000/78/EC</a> and furthermore acknowledges that women with\\n"
"        disabilities, in particular, are more likely to suffer from "
"multiple forms of discrimination. It accordingly calls for measures "
"combining the\\n"
"        mainstreaming of gender issues and specific gender-sensitive "
"measures in the disability field. In the light of the new convention, "
"the European\\n"
"        Commission is examining whether it needs to adopt measures of "
"its own to prevent and combat discrimination beyond the area of the "
"labour market. In\\n"
"        December 2007, it will present a Communication putting forward "
"the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs next action plan on disabilities, "
"aimed at implementing the UN\\n"
"        Convention. Member States must also sign the convention "
"individually as signature constitutes the first step of becoming "
"formally a party to the\\n"
"        convention.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>It should be noted that under EU law the obligation of the "
"employer to provide ΓΆβ‚¬Λreasonable "

"the\\n"
"        recruitment, promotion and maintenance in employment of an "
"individual who is not competent, capable and available to perform the "
"essential functions of\\n"
"        the post concerned. The ECJ outlined that "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛsicknessΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά as such cannot be regarded "
"as a ground in addition to those in relation to which the directive\\n"
"        2000/78/EC prohibits discrimination. In contrast, the Spanish "
"court, which referred the questions on the interpretation of the "

"Directive 97/80/EC</a> of 15 December 1997 on the burden of proof in "
"cases of sex discrimination. The translation of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λmanagement prerogativesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά into "
"different treatment of workers is increasingly challenged by the "
"expanding body of law that focuses on discrimination at work.</p> "
"<p>Council Decision 2000/750/EC of 27 November 2000 established a "
"<i>Community Action Programme</i> to combat discrimination "
"(2001-2006). The purpose of the Action Programme is to extend EU "
"action beyond legislation, for example, by developing the capabilities "
"of those in the field such as local authorities, independent "
"specialist bodies and the social partners via exchanges of "
"information, dissemination of good practice and the creation of "
"networks. A separate action programme covering sex discrimination is "
"provided for in Commission Decision 2001/51/EC which establishes a "
"Community framework strategy for <a href=\\genderequality.htm\\>gender "
"equality</a> (2001-2005), the latest in a series of action programmes "
"beginning in 1982 (Gender Equality Action Programme). An earlier "
"Communication (COM (99) 564 final) led to two Directives that extend "
"the <a href=\\n"
"ondiscriminationprinciple.htm\\>non-discrimination principle</a> to "
"these new areas. Council Directive 2000/43 implements the principle of "
"<a href=\\equaltreatment.htm\\>equal treatment</a> between persons "
"irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. Council Directive 2000/78 "
"establishes a general framework for equal treatment in employment and "
"occupation.</p> <h3>Objective justification for different "
"treatment</h3> <p>Objective justification for different treatment "
"refers to an admissible or lawful basis for treating an individual or "
"group differently to others in the workplace or beyond. EU law "
"prohibits discrimination on an increasing number of grounds, meaning "
"that it is difficult for employers to treat people differently without "
"encountering a charge of discrimination and needing to establish an "
"objective justification for doing so.</p> <p>However, there exists a "
"range of substantive objective justifications for discrimination in "
"both legislation and European Court of Justice (ECJ) case law. For "
"example, Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on the "
"implementation of the principle of equal treatment for women and men "
"with respect to <a href=\\accesstoemployment.htm\\>access to "
"employment</a>, <a href=\\vocationaltraining.htm\\>vocational "
"training</a> and <a href=\\promotion.htm\\>promotion</a>, and <a "
"href=\\workingconditions.htm\\>working conditions</a> justifies "
"different treatment based on genuine occupational qualifications, for "
"the protection of women (particularly during <a "
"href=\\pregnancyandmaternity.htm\\>pregnancy and maternity</a>), and "
"for promoting appropriate <a href=\\positiveaction.htm\\>positive "
"action</a>.</p> <p>The ECJ has also upheld justifications for indirect "
"discrimination based on characteristics that relate to specific jobs "
"or enterprise types. For example, where part-time workers are treated "
"differently and this affects a greater proportion of women than men, "
"the employer must show that the different treatment is based on "
"objectively justified factors unrelated to sex discrimination. The ECJ "
"upheld different treatment as objectively justifiable on the basis of "
"organisational business need in the case of <i>Bilka-Kaufhaus GmbH v. "
"Karin Weber von Hartz</i> (<a "

"<br /> <p>Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is the process by which "
"the economic and monetary policies of the EU Member States are "
"harmonised, culminating in the introduction of a single currency, the "
"euro. The convergence required for Economic and Monetary Union was "
"prescribed by the EC Treaty setting criteria to be met by a Member "
"State before it can take part (Article 140 TFEU, Articles 1-4 of the "
"Protocol on Convergence Criteria). Compliance with the criteria is to "
"be examined by the Commission and the European Central Bank. The "
"criteria are:</p> <ul> <li>the ratio of government deficit to gross "
"domestic product must not exceed 3%;</li> <li>the ratio of government "
"debt to gross domestic product must not exceed 60%;</li> <li>there "
"must be a sustainable degree of price stability and an average "
"inflation rate, observed over a period of one year before the "
"examination, which does not exceed by more than 1.5% that of the three "
"best performing Member States in terms of price stability;</li> "
"<li>there must be a long-term nominal interest rate, which does not "
"exceed by more than 2% that of the three best performing Member States "
"in terms of price stability;</li> <li>the normal fluctuation margins "
"provided for by the exchange rate mechanism on the European monetary "
"system must have been respected without severe tensions for at least "
"the last two years before the examination.</li> </ul> <p>Eleven Member "
"States met these criteria by the deadline of the third stage of EMU (1 "
"January 1999), and Greece also did so two years later, before the euro "
"was introduced on 1 January 2003, replacing the national currencies "
"for more than 300 million EU citizens. The other Member States remain "
"outside the euro.</p> <p>With the objective of maintaining monetary "
"stability, the convergence criteria relating to government deficit and "
"government debt were to continue after the introduction of the euro. "
"To that end, the Member States adopted a ΓΆβ‚¬ΛStability and "
"growth pactΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά embodied in a European Council "
"resolution adopted at Amsterdam on 17 June 1997 and two Council "
"regulations of 7 July 1997. This allowed for the Council to impose "
"financial penalties on participating Member States that failed to "
"comply. It remains unclear whether failure by some Member States to "
"comply will in practice trigger the sanctions envisaged.</p> <p>The "
"implications of Europeanisation of economic policymaking following EMU "
"for employment and industrial relations in the EU are potentially "
"vast. The focus on monetary stability presents challenges for policies "
"aimed at growth, with consequences for employment levels. In "
"particular, the rigid convergence criteria for public debts and "
"deficits pose difficulties for public finances at a time of economic "
"downturns and retrenchment, again with implications for employment and "
"social policy in general. The elimination of national currencies means "
"devaluation will no longer be available to enable national adjustment "
"to competitive pressures. One possible consequence could be that <a "
"href=\\labourcosts.htm\\>labour costs</a> become a focus of "
"competitive pressure, with consequences for collective bargaining and "
"industrial relations. On the other hand, the European Commission "
"argues that macroeconomic pressures would also increase the need for "
"the development of a European social agenda.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"of ΓΆβ‚¬Λservice contractΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά with the "
"employer. Second, they depend on one single employer for\\n"
"        all or much of their income. They are often similar to "
"employees in a number of ways. They may lack a clear organisational "
"separation, working on the\\n"
"        employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs premises and/or using the "
"employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs equipment. There may be no clear "
"distinction of tasks: they may perform similar tasks to existing\\n"
"        employees, or of those formerly undertaken by employees, "
"before the work was outsourced. Finally, their "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛservicesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά fall outside the "

"repairing power lines. The Directive was adopted together with other "
"measures intended to protect workers from the health effects of other "

"when corporate decision-making processes are outside the establishment "

"and consulting with employee representatives becomes more complex and "
"difficult. This is particularly so when the corporate employer taking "
"a dismissal decision is outside the Member State in which the "
"dismissals are being implemented. The transnational dimension of "
"decision-making on collective dismissals was addressed by a 1992 "
"amendment to the Collective Dismissals Directive of 1975: "

"Directive 98/59/EC</a> of 20 July 1998). The employer remains the "
"subject of the obligation. It is also recognised that the legal "
"structure of the employer may be articulated with other undertakings "
"nationally and transnationally, so that dismissals in one undertaking "
"may be decided, or be the consequence of decisions, by other "
"undertakings.</p> <p>Due to the problems posed by complex corporate "

"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛemployerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, but instead has sought to "
"identify the appropriate ΓΆβ‚¬Λlevel of "
"decision-makingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in the undertaking, which is "
"concerned with the relevant employment or industrial relations matter. "
"For example, in <a "

"Directive 2002/14</a> establishing a framework for informing and "

"to ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe relevant level of management and "
"representationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά being involved, depending on the "

"ΓΆβ‚¬Λappropriate levelΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is now reflected in "
"the <a "
"href=\\charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter of "
"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>.</p> <p>The complex and "

"Directive 94/45/EC</a> of 22 September 1994 on the establishment of <a "
"href=\\europeanworkscouncils.htm\\>European Works Councils</a> (EWCs) "
"or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale "
"groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing employees and "
"consulting with them. By definition, the EWC has to deal with an "
"employer established in more than one Member State. The Directive, "
"therefore, imposes obligations not on the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛemployerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, but on the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λcentral management of the Community-scale undertaking, "
"or, in the case of a Community-scale group of undertakings, of the "
"controlling undertakingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 2(1)(e)). The "
"definition of ΓΆβ‚¬Λcontrolling undertakingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"refers to ΓΆβ‚¬Λan undertaking, which can exercise a dominant "
"influence over another undertaking (ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe controlled "
"undertakingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά) by virtue, for example, of ownership, "
"financial participation or the rules, which govern "
"itΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 3(1)). Even the central management of a "
"multinational undertaking may not be the effective repository of the "
"responsibility of the ΓΆβ‚¬ΛemployerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. This "
"is so where the central management is situated outside the EU. Hence, "
"Article 4(2) provides: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛWhere the central management is "
"not situated in a Member State, the central "
"managementΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs representative agent in a Member State, "
"to be designated if necessary, shall take on the "

"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛemployerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά emerges in the first "
"decisions of the European Court of Justice on the European Works "
"Councils Directive. The European Court has held that an undertaking "
"which is part of a group of undertakings is required to supply "
"information to the internal workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representative "
"bodies, even where it has not yet been established that the management "
"to which the workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά request is addressed is the "
"management of a controlling undertaking within a group of undertakings "

"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980L0987:EN:HTML\\>Directive "

"claims arising from contracts of employment or employment "
"relationshipsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 1(1)) (repeated in Articles "
"3(1), 3(2), and 4(2)).</p> <p>However, the initiative most clearly "
"directed to the problem of the limited concept of the contract of "
"employment was <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0533:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 91/533/EEC</a> of 14 October 1991 on an "
"employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs obligation to inform employees of the "
"conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship. "
"Article 1(1) of the Directive defines its scope as follows: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThis Directive shall apply to every paid employee "
"having a contract or employment relationship defined by the law in "
"force in a Member State and/or governed by the law in force in a "
"Member StateΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>The Directive makes a clear "
"distinction between contractual and other employment relationships, "
"i.e. workers who do not have a contract of employment, but nonetheless "
"are in a relationship of employment. Both forms of relationship are "
"included within the scope of the Directive. By including within its "
"scope workers who do not have a contract of employment, and thus do "
"not fall within the definition of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛemployeeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, it raises a question of "
"what criteria constitute an employment relationship, which is not also "
"a contract of employment.</p> <p>An obvious category is that of "
"independent contractors/self-employed workers, who are normally "
"considered in national law as having not a contract of employment, but "
"a contract for services. These are paid workers and they have a "
"relationship of employment. This relationship, contrary to the title "
"of self-employment, is with the paying client or customer. However, "
"there are obviously other types. This emerges with clarity from "
"Article 1(2)(b), which states that the Directive applies to casual "
"and/or specific workers, unless its non-application is justified. The "
"problem of classifying such workers as employees has been encountered "
"in domestic law.</p> <p>First, they must be "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛpaidΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. That is not the same as saying "
"there is a contract, although being paid makes it likely. The "
"Directive clearly envisages paid employment relationships, which are "
"not contractual. Moreover, the Directive does not specify from whom "
"the payment comes. The definition of ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a "
"href=\\pay.htm\\>pay</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in Article 157(2) TFEU "
"(equal pay) specifies pay ΓΆβ‚¬Λwhich the worker receives... "
"from his employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. In contracts of employment, "
"payment will normally be received from the employer. However, "
"employment relationships may not be as direct as employment contracts, "
"and the modalities of remuneration are more diverse. There is an "
"extremely wide definition given in Article 157(2) TFEU: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λ...ΓΆβ‚¬ΛpayΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά means the "
"ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other consideration, "
"whether in cash or in kind, which the worker receives, directly or "
"indirectly, in respect of his "
"employmentΓΆβ‚¬Β¦.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>Second, the "
"information required by <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0533:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"91/533</a> is of the ΓΆβ‚¬Λessential aspects of the contract "
"or employment relationship (Article 2(1)).ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά There is "
"no formal checklist. What is an essential aspect of the employment "
"relationship will depend on the nature of the relationship. The "
"information provided ΓΆβ‚¬Λshall cover at "
"leastΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά certain items listed in Article 2(2). The "
"degree of specification required is variable. For example, the place "
"of work need not be fixed (Article 2(2)(b)); there need be no work "
"title - a brief description of the work will suffice (Article 2(2)(c); "
"leave and notice entitlements may be indicated through a procedure or "
"method of determining them (Article 2(2)(f,g)); and relevant "
"collective agreements only where appropriate (Article 2(2)(j)). "
"However, there is required information on the date of commencement of "
"the relationship (Article 2(2)(d)); if a temporary relationship, the "
"expected duration Article 2(2)(e)); remuneration entitlement (Article "
"2(2)(h)), within the broad sense of rewards described above, and "
"normal working time (Article 2(2)(i)).</p> <p>Third, employment "
"relationships ΓΆβ‚¬Λof a casual and/or specific "
"natureΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά may be excluded, but only if this is "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λjustified by objective considerationsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"(Article 1(2)(b)). The casual and/or specific nature of work does not "
"preclude it being an employment relationship (or even a contract). The "

"that Member States shall coordinate their economic and employment "

"employment title of the TFEU (specifically Article 148) sets out the "
"specific process for implementing the EES. The Council and Commission "
"formulate an annual joint report that is put to the European Council. "
"On the basis of the conclusions of the European Council, the "

"guidelines</a> to be adopted by the Council and which the Member "
"States ΓΆβ‚¬Λshall take into account in their employment "

"annual report (national employment report) on ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe "
"principal measures taken to implement its employment policy in the "

msgid ""
"<br /> <p>Enforcement of <a href=\\eulaw.htm\\>EU law</a> is the "
"prerogative of the European Commission. Community legal measures on "
"employment and industrial relations take the legal form mainly of "
"Directives. EU Directives, once implemented into Member State laws, "
"are enforced through the national administrative mechanisms applicable "
"to the relevant national law on employment and industrial "
"relations.</p> <p>In the EU Member States, the administrations "
"responsible for enforcing laws on employment and industrial relations "
"include both general bodies, in the form of labour ministries, and "
"specialist bodies ΓΆβ‚¬β€ for example, health and safety "
"inspectorates and equal opportunity commissions. Historically, "
"administrative processes of enforcement were established in national "
"labour laws, where workers were unable in practice to enforce their "
"rights through judicial processes, and lacked the organisational "
"strength to be able to rely on industrial relations practices. This "
"historical experience is reflected only in part in the enforcement of "
"EU legal measures.</p> <p>Administrative enforcement of EU law is, "
"therefore, achieved through national administrative mechanisms. "
"However, these national administrative mechanisms responsible for "
"enforcing EU law must satisfy EU standards of enforcement. The "
"effectiveness of national administrative enforcement mechanisms in "
"enforcing EU law is subject to review. There have emerged three "
"principles: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛequivalenceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of "
"enforcement of EU and national law, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛeffectivenessΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of enforcement of EU "
"law (regardless of national law standards of enforcement) and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛproportionalityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of methods of "
"enforcement to the norms being enforced. Together, this "
"Europeanisation of administrative enforcement is said to produce a "
"general ΓΆβ‚¬Λprinciple of effective "
"enforcementΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά applied to administrative processes of "
"enforcement of EU labour standards.</p> <p>Enforcement of the EU law "
"regulating employment and industrial relations has specific qualities, "
"which distinguish it from enforcement of domestic labour laws. In "
"addition, EU labour law has special features, which distinguish it "
"from other branches of EU law.</p> <p>The enforcement of EU law has "
"its own general principles, but in each Member State it will be "
"influenced by the national system in which it operates. Enforcement "
"mechanisms of Unnion labour law cannot be a wholly autonomous product. "
"National traditions of labour law enforcement will not easily give way "
"to purely Union legal techniques. Rather, the EU has experimented with "
"a number of traditional techniques, some of which have had more "
"success than others. The success of enforcement of Union labour law "
"has perhaps been greatest where the EU legal technique meshes with the "
"national traditions of administrative enforcement, implemented through "
"the social partners and through the courts.</p> <p>Although the <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"cannot itself adjudicate on complaints by individuals that their "
"rights under Union law have been violated, the ECJ has developed "
"procedures and minimum standards for the enforcement of EU law in "
"national courts through their requests for preliminary rulings under "
"Article 267 TFEU.</p> <p>Where the social partners are the instruments "
"of implementation and enforcement of national labour law, this "
"mechanism has been accepted as a channel for EU labour law "
"implementation. For instance, Article 153 (3) TFEU allows the social "
"partners to take upon themselves the role of implementing and "
"enforcing Union Directives on employment and industrial relations.</p> "
"<p>Development of judicial liability for breaches of EU law is "
"particularly important in systems where litigation plays an important "
"role in labour law enforcement. This method of enforcement of EU law "
"on employment and industrial relations is relatively straightforward, "
"where it grants clear rights to individuals or organisations and "
"national law has implemented these rights through legal measures "
"capable of enforcement through the domestic courts.</p> <p>Enforcement "
"is not so straightforward where implementation by national authorities "
"of EU legislation is unsatisfactory. In such cases, enforcement may "
"proceed through the domestic courts using doctrines of <a "
"href=\\directeffect.htm\\>direct effect</a> and <a "
"href=\\indirecteffect.htm\\>indirect effect</a>, or invoking the "
"doctrine of State responsibility.</p> <p>In general, the European "
"Court has made a sustained effort to scrutinise the remedies, <a "
"href=\\sanctions.htm\\>sanctions</a> and procedures available at "
"national level for the enforcement of EU law on employment and "
"industrial relations.</p> <p>Finally, EU law also offers possible "
"strategies to use the courts to challenge national law, which "
"contradicts EU law: <a "

"and the unemployment gap had fallen from 12% to 9%. However, the "

"governments are expected to meet targets for childcare facilities by "
"2010.</p> <p>Although gender formed its primary focus, the equal "

"appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or "
"ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual "
"orientationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Following earlier initiatives, the 1998 "
"Employment Guideline 19 promoted the integration of people with "
"disabilities into working life. The 1999 <a "
"href=\\employmentguidelines.htm\\>employment guidelines</a> requested "
"that Member States give ΓΆβ‚¬Λspecial attention to the needs "
"of the disabled, ethnic minorities and other groups and individuals "
"who may be disadvantaged, and develop appropriate forms of preventive "
"and active policies to promote their integration into the labour "
"marketΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Council Resolution on the 1999 employment "
"guidelines, [1999]). Furthermore, the 2002 guidelines included "
"provisions for developing policies for ΓΆβ‚¬Λactive "
"ageingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Guideline 3) and for promoting social "
"inclusion by enhancing <a href=\\accesstoemployment.htm\\>access to "
"employment</a> (Guideline 7).</p> <h3>Formal equality</h3> <p>Formal "
"equality embodies liberal notions of equal opportunity that emphasise "
"procedural equality. Every person is to be helped to compete equally "
"on the basis of their individual talents. Sources of <a "
"href=\\discrimination.htm\\>discrimination</a> are to be removed and "
"positive action is limited to compensation for disadvantage.</p> "
"<p>The concept assumes that individuals may act autonomously to make "
"independent choices, and that open and free competition guarantees a "
"fair outcome. However, concern with equality of opportunity at the "
"outset does not necessarily lead to equality of outcome, and the "
"process of competition itself is not necessarily neutral. People "
"treated differently in the past may thus remain in dissimilar "
"positions and discrimination may be perpetuated. Indeed, this has "
"traditionally been regarded as problematic for women, the construction "
"of whose roles in the ΓΆβ‚¬ΛprivateΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά sphere "
"have helped to determine the nature of their participation in the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛpublicΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά sphere of the labour market. "
"Formal equality is often criticised for its inadequacy in a world "
"where access to material and symbolic rewards is structured along "
"gender lines, a clear indication of which is persistent occupational "
"sex segregation of the labour force.</p> <h3>Substantive equality</h3> "
"<p>Substantive equality concerns an equitable distribution or result "
"(an equality of outcome), as opposed to equality of opportunity or "
"treatment.</p> <p>This approach calls for direct intervention in "
"workplace practices to achieve a fair (representative/proportional) "
"distribution of outcomes. It adopts a group, as opposed to individual "
"or liberal, model of justice. In the workplace, it is associated with "
"such measures as quotas and preferential hiring. It has sometimes been "
"regarded as an approach that compensates for the limited or "
"disproportionate impacts of formal or liberal approaches.</p> "
"<p>European equality law adopts elements of both formal and "
"substantive equality approaches while some national applications of "
"European law have favoured an individualised, liberal "
"conceptualisation of equality. Increasingly, however, intervention "
"aimed at redistribution has gained currency, as indicated by the "
"collectivisation of individualistic processes in the labour "
"market.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>The law of the European Union (EU law) emerged with the "
"creation of the EU in the Treaty on European Union, which came into "
"force in 1993. Before then, European Community law (EC law) was the "
"law of the three Communities established in the 1950s: the European "
"Coal and Steel Community (ECSC, expired in 2002), the European "
"Economic Community (EEC) and the Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). "
"After the Treaty on European Union, the EEC became the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEuropean CommunityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and this term was "
"used to refer to all three Communities. From 1993 to 2009 , the "
"European Community was one of the three "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛpillarsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of the EU, but it ceased to "
"exist with the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.</p> <p>EU law is "
"supranational law: that is, it is not determined or confined by "
"national law. National rules on employment and industrial relations "
"have been transformed by the infusion of rules having supranational "
"origin: EU law. Understanding this requires a mental leap, from seeing "
"the laws of the Member States as national and autonomous systems of "
"rules and institutions to seeing the Member State laws, including "
"their labour laws, as part of a transnational system of rule-making "
"and enforcement machinery, comprising the institutions of the EU "
"established by the Member States.</p> <p>The distinctive quality of "
"the EEC Treaty (now TFEU) was defined by the European Court of Justice "
"in the most significant passage of its most notable decision: <i>Van "
"Gend en Loos</i> (<i>N.V. Algemene Transport- en Expeditie Onderneming "
"van Gend &amp; Loos and Nederlandse administratie der belastingen "
"(Netherlands Inland Revenue Administration)</i>, <a "

"26/62 [1963]</a>:</p> <p><i>The objective of the EEC Treaty, which is "
"to establish a Common Market, the functioning of which is of direct "
"concern to interested parties in the Community, implies that this "
"Treaty is more than an agreement, which merely creates mutual "
"obligations between the contracting states. This view is confirmed by "
"the preamble to the Treaty, which refers not only to governments but "
"also to peoples. It is also confirmed more specifically by the "
"establishment of institutions endowed with sovereign rights, the "
"exercise of which affects Member States and their "
"citizensΓΆβ‚¬Β¦</i></p> <p>In addition, the task assigned to "
"the <a href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of "
"Justice</a> under Article 267 TFEU, the object of which is to secure "
"uniform interpretation of the Treaty by national courts and tribunals, "
"confirms that the states have acknowledged that Community law has an "
"authority, which can be invoked by their nationals before those courts "
"and tribunals.</p> <p>However, the significance of the ruling that EU "
"law could create enforceable legal rights for individuals in national "
"courts was greatly magnified by the European Court ruling that "
"precedence was to be accorded to EU law over domestic law. The Court "
"not only characterised EU law as part of domestic law, it declared the "
"supremacy of EU law over other domestic law:</p> <p><i>The precedence "
"of Community law is confirmed by Article [249 EC], whereby a "
"regulation ΓΆβ‚¬Λshall be bindingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λdirectly applicable in all Member "
"StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. This provision which is subject to no "
"reservation, would be quite meaningless if a state could unilaterally "
"nullify by means of a legislative measure which could prevail over "
"Community law.</i></p> <p>This goes beyond the incorporation into "
"domestic law of EU law. It means that the EU institutions may create "
"law, even where the Member State opposes the adoption of that law by "
"those EU institutions, provided that a voting procedure based on a "
"majority rule applies to that specific field. EU law must be enforced "
"in national courts even where this involves overriding the national "
"law produced by domestic law-making institutions.</p> <p>In the course "
"of time, national constitutional courts have accepted the principles "
"of supremacy of the EU law affirmed by the European Court of Justice, "
"but some continue to express reservations as to whether it overrides "
"fundamental principles of each national constitution.</p> <p>See also: "

"(a general cross-industry organisation), Eurocadres focuses on "
"representing the growing number of professional and managerial staff "
"in Europe, a group which accounted for around 15% of all employees in "
"the EU Member States in 2010.</p> <p>Eurocadres was created in "
"November 1993 from inside the ETUC. The impetus came from the the "
"perception that managers and executives ΓΆβ‚¬β€ despite "
"having the formal status of employees ΓΆβ‚¬β€ have specific "
"needs and that their interests are best served by special "
"organisations. Nevertheless, Eurocadres has continued its associated "
"with ETUC.</p> <p>Eurocadres has a membership of more than 5 million, "
"represents all branches of industry, both public and private, and is "
"directly or indirectly present in all the Member States of the "
"European Union, though not to the same extent. Eurocadres is composed "
"of 47 national member organisations and 12 European members. Some "
"members of Eurocadres are in fact unions or other organisations of "
"salaried employees affiliated to their countryΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs main "
"trade union confederation, which in turn is affiliated to ETUC. These "
"unions or organisations do not always have a proper organisation or "
"specific section for professional and managerial staff, but instead "
"tend to have ΓΆβ‚¬Λcoordination unitsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά or "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛsecretariatsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>The "
"constitutional bodies of Eurocadres are the Congress and the Executive "
"Committee. The Congress meets every four years and is responsible for "
"determining the policy guidelines within the framework of "
"EurocadresΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά general objectives. The Congress also "
"elects the members of the Executive Committee which has "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ in accordance with the Congress decisions "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the overall responsibility for activities and "
"policies between the Congresses. A Presidium, composed of the "
"President, Vice-president, Treasurer, Executive Officer and the other "
"officers, is responsible for taking decisions between Executive "
"Committee meetings. A General Assembly is held every year when there "
"is no Congress.</p> <p>As a recognised social partner, Eurocadres is "
"consulted by the European Commission on all social policy and "
"industrial relations initiatives. Such consultation is required under "
"articles 154 and 155 TFEU relating to European social dialogue. The "

"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF\\>Treaty "
"on the Functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU). The European "
"Commission acts as an executive of the European Union. The body is "
"responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, "
"upholding the Union\\'s treaties and the general day-to-day running of "
"the Union. The Commission is appointed for a five-year term by the "
"Council acting by qualified majority in agreement with the Member "
"States. It is subject to a vote of appointment by the European "
"Parliament, to which it is answerable. The Commissioners are assisted "
"by an administration made up of Directorates-General and specialised "
"departments whose staff are divided mainly between Brussels and "
"Luxembourg.</p> <p>The term "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛCommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά can mean either the 27 "
"Commissioners themselves (known as the College of Commissioners), or "
"the larger institution that also includes the administrative body of "
"about 25,000 European civil servants who are split into departments "
"called Directorates-General and Services.</p> <p>The Commission "
"embodies the supranational interests of the European Community. For "
"this reason, members of the Commission ΓΆβ‚¬Λshall neither "
"seek nor take instructions from any Government or other institution, "
"body, office or entity. They shall refrain from any action "
"incompatible with their duties or the performance of their "
"tasksΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (TEU, Article 17(3)). As ΓΆβ‚¬Λengine "
"of the TreatiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, one of the principal sources of the "
"Commission\\'s authority within the EU polity lies in its monopoly to "
"issue legislative proposals. All legislative acts must begin with an "
"initiative by the Commission. Legislative proposals in each policy "
"area are usually formulated within the relevant unit of a "
"Directorates-General (DG) before being processed upwards to the "
"Cabinets first, and finally, to the College of Commissioners. If "
"approved by the College, the initiative is channelled through the "
"relevant legislative or other regulatory procedures. Decisions in the "
"College of Commissioners are put to a simple majority vote, but once "
"adopted, they are supported by all Commissioners. In drawing up and "
"submitting policy proposals, though, Article 154 TFEU requires the "
"Commission to ΓΆβ‚¬Λconsult management and labour on the "
"possible direction of Union actionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Once the "
"Commission concludes that action is required, it again consults the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeansocialpartners.htm\\>European "
"social partners</a> on the content of any eventual proposal.</p> <p>In "
"promoting European policy, the Commission calls on the expertise of "
"some 40 DGs and services, which are sub-divided in turn into "
"directorates, and then into units. Each DG is allocated a specific "
"administrative responsibility for a policy area and under the "
"political responsibility of a Commissioner. In the area of European "
"employment and social policy, the responsible organ is the <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=656\\>Employment, "
"Social Affairs and Inclusion DG</a> (DG-EMPL). The <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/directorategeneralforemploymentsocialaffairsandequalopportunities.htm\\> "
"DG-EMPL</a> is also the department of the European Commission "
"responsible for industrial relations in Europe.DG-EMPL is organised "
"into directorates. Directorate B (composed of 4 units: Social "
"Dialogue/Industrial Relations (B/1), Labour Law (B/2), Health, Safety "
"and Hygiene at Work (B/3) and Free Movement of Workers Coordination of "
"Social Security Schemes (B/4)) is responsible for accompanying the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeansocialdialogueandimplementationofagreements.htm\\>European "
"social dialogue</a> both at intersectoral and sectoral levels.</p> "
"<p>In the social policy domain, as well as in other policy fields, the "
"European Commission operates in a close relationship and dynamic "
"institutional equilibrium with the other Community institutions, in "
"particular the Council, <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeanparliament.htm\\>European "
"Parliament</a> and <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European "

"will depend to a large extent on the good cooperation with these other "
"Community institutions, with the Member States and, in the social "
"dialogue process, with the social partners.</p> <p>Another important "
"function of the Commission is its role as guardian of the Treaties. As "
"such, the Commission firmly supervises, controls and, if need be, "
"files complaints to the ECJ in order to ensure that the other Union "

"tries to resolve the problem through informal dialogue with the EU "
"Member State accused of breaching Community law. Should this chosen "
"strategy prove unsuccessful, a formal letter is despatched outlining "
"the breach and requesting the EU Member State to respond accordingly. "
"If the allegation remains unresolved, however, the Commission, under "
"Article 258 TFEU, delivers a ΓΆβ‚¬Λreasoned "

"Member State that it considers\\n"
"        ΓΆβ‚¬Λhas failed to fulfil an obligation under this "
"Treaty.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Both the acts and omissions of EU Member "

"\\n"
"        <p>In accordance with Article 226 EC, the Commission may "
"initiate an investigation of its own volition or following on from "
"receipt of a complaint. In\\n"
"        practice, complaints from individuals are important in the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs ability to detect <a "
"href=\\infringementsofeclaw.htm\\>infringements of EC\\n"
"        law</a> and there is a complaint form for use by individuals. "
"The CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs action is in two stages: an "
"administrative stage and a judicial stage. A\\n"
"        majority of actions are resolved through informal dialogue "
"with the EU Member State that is alleged to have breached Community "
"law. If the alleged\\n"
"        breaches are not rectified at the informal stage, then a "
"formal letter is despatched outlining the breach and requesting the EU "
"Member State to\\n"
"        respond. An example is failure by a Member State to implement "
"directives within the time limit specified in the directive. In 1989, "
"the Commission\\n"
"        stated that Member States would be notified that immediate "
"infringement proceedings would be brought against a defaulting state "
"as soon the time limit\\n"

"\\n"
"        <p>If the allegation remains unresolved, the Commission "
"delivers a ΓΆβ‚¬Λreasoned opinionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά to the "

"        weeks for compliance. If within eight weeks the breach is not "
"remedied, the Commission may bring the matter before the European "

"<br /> <p>The European Company Statute enables companies to operate "
"their businesses on a transnational basis within the European Union "
"under the same corporate regime. A particular feature of this legal "
"form consists of obligatory negotiations on the right to worker "
"involvement in European companies, which includes the question of "
"employee representation at board level.</p> <p>A European company "
"(<i>Societas Europaea</i> (SE)) operates on a Europe-wide basis and is "
"governed by EC law directly applicable in the Member States, rather "
"than by national law. This was established by the European Company "
"Statute (ECS) Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 2157/2001 on the "

"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/informationandconsultation.htm\\>information "
"and consultation</a> of employees and, in some cases, board-level "
"participation. Both the regulation and the directive were adopted on 8 "
"October 2001 and were required to be implemented in the Member States "
"by 8 October 2004.</p> <p>EU-based companies may become SEs in four "
"ways (the first three involve more than one company): merger; creation "
"of a joint holding company; creation of a subsidiary; or when a single "
"EU-based company is transformed into an SE, provided it has had a "
"subsidiary governed by the law of another Member State for at least "
"two years. A company based outside the EU may (if individual Member "
"States so decide) participate in the creation of an SE on condition "
"that it is created under the law of a Member State, has its registered "
"office in that Member State and has ΓΆβ‚¬Λa real and "
"continuousΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά link with a Member "
"StateΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs economy.</p> <p>Council Regulation "
"2157/2001/EC on the ECS is linked with <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0086:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"2001/86/EC</a> on the involvement of employees in the SE: they "

"Regulation 2157/2001/EC</a>). Consequently, in accordance with Article "
"12(2) of the regulation, an SE may only be registered if an agreement "
"for employee involvement pursuant to Article 4 of Directive 2001/86/EC "
"has been concluded. Arrangements for employee involvement differ "
"according to the way the SE is created. Companies that decide to "
"establish an SE must negotiate with a <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/specialnegotiatingbody.htm\\>special "
"negotiating body</a> (SNB), comprising employee representatives "
"elected or appointed in proportion to the number of employees employed "
"in each Member State.</p> <p>There are three possible scenarios with "
"regard to employee involvement in an SE:</p> <ol> <li>The SNB may "
"decide, with a two-thirds majority, not to open negotiations or to "
"terminate negotiations that are already ongoing. In this case, "
"national rules on information and consultation of employees enter into "
"force and only a <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeanworkscouncils.htm\\>European "
"Works Council</a> is constituted.</li> <li>The SNB and the competent "
"bodies of the participating companies conclude an agreement on the "
"involvement of employees according to Article 4 of the directive.</li> "
"<li>The SNB and the competent bodies of the participating companies "
"fail to reach an agreement or agree voluntarily to apply the "
"obligatory standard rules according to Article 7 of the "
"directive.</li> </ol> <p>As required by Article 15 of the directive, "
"on 30 September 2008 the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeancommission.htm\\>European "
"Commission</a> published a <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52008DC0591:EN:HTML\\>Communication</a> "
"reviewing the application of the directive with a view to proposing "
"any necessary amendments. Due to the lack of practical experience in "
"applying the directive, the European Commission decided to defer the "
"revision process. However, a particular concern is caused by the lack "
"of provisions to deal with changes taking place within the SE after "
"its establishment. According to the Communication, this shortcoming "
"might include the risk of losing or reducing employee participation "
"rights.</p> <p>In June 2010, some 588 SEs were established. Only "
"around a quarter (145) are carrying out "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Ε“realΓΆβ‚¬Β economic activities with employees "
"(ΓΆβ‚¬Ε“normal SEsΓΆβ‚¬Β). This implies that to date "
"the vast majority of SEs is not actively doing business and employing "
"people. Many of the SEs (78) are so-called "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Ε“shelfΓΆβ‚¬Β companies which are for sale with "
"most of them in the Czech Republic (43), "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Ε“emptyΓΆβ‚¬Β SEs (82) without any employees "
"yet and a rather large number of SEs (around 283) on which no "
"information is available at all (ΓΆβ‚¬Ε“UFOsΓΆβ‚¬Β). "
"This diverse picture of different types of SEs is also replicated with "
"regard to the geographical coverage: In eight Member States (BG, EL, "
"FI, IT, LT, MT, RO, SI) no SE has been registered. The diffusion of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Ε“normalΓΆβ‚¬Β SEs is also very unequal with "
"Germany being the most important country for "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Ε“normalΓΆβ‚¬Β SEs (73) and 20 SEs are present "
"in the Czech Republic. Around 45% of normal SEs have been established "
"by the conversion of an already existing company, while around 25% "
"resulted from mergers. Only a comparatively small number have been "
"established as holding companies or as subsidiaries. Half of all "
"normal SEs have fewer than 500 employees.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights "

"href=\\councilofeurope.htm\\>Council of Europe</a> in 1950, hence "
"pre-dating the establishment of the European Union. However, all EU "
"Member States are Members of the Council of Europe and have ratified "
"the ECHR.</p> <p>The Convention establishes the European Court of "
"Human Rights. Any person who feels their rights have been violated "
"under the Convention by a state party can take a case to the Court; "
"the decisions of the Court are legally binding, and the Court has the "
"power to award damages. State parties can also take cases against "
"other state parties to the Court, although this power is rarely "
"used.</p> <p>The ECHR includes a number of rights relevant to the "
"fields of employment and industrial relations. For example, in the "
"decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>Wilson and "
"Palmer</i> cases, a trade union successfully complained under Article "
"11 of the European Convention for a violation of freedom of "
"association (<i>Wilson and the National Union of Journalists; Palmer, "
"Wyeth and the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers; "
"Doolan and others v. United Kingdom</i>, [2002] Industrial Relations "
"Law Reports 128, decided 2 July 2002, ECHR).</p> <p>The European Court "

"<br /> <p>The Court of Justice of the European Communities (often "
"referred to simply as ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe CourtΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά) was "
"set up under the ECSC Treaty in 1952. It is based in Luxembourg. "
"Article 19 TEU provides that the role of the European Court of Justice "
"(ECJ) is ΓΆβ‚¬Λ(ΓΆβ‚¬Β¦) to ensure that in the "
"interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is "
"observed.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά It makes sure that EU legislation is "
"interpreted and applied in the same way in all EU countries, so that "
"the law is equal for everyone. It ensures, for example, that national "
"courts do not give different rulings on the same issue. The Court also "
"ensures that EU Member States and institutions do what the law "
"requires. The Court has the power to settle legal disputes between EU "
"Member States, EU institutions, businesses and individuals.</p> <p>The "
"Court is composed of one judge per Member State, so that all 27 of the "
"EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs national legal systems are represented. The "
"Court is assisted by eight "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λadvocates-generalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά whose role is to "
"present reasoned opinions on the cases brought before the Court. They "
"must do so publicly and impartially. The Court may meet in plenary "
"session, or create chambers of three or five judges. Only a single "
"judgement is delivered in each case, signed by all judges, without any "
"dissenting opinions. Hence, all decisions are both unanimous and "
"anonymous, preventing any attempt to attribute the result to the "
"nationality of the judges deciding the case.</p> <p>Most matters "
"brought before the Court are either references from national courts "
"for preliminary rulings or direct actions. Preliminary rulings by the "
"Court result from requests by Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά national "
"courts for the ECJ ΓΆβ‚¬Λto give preliminary rulings "
"concerningΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά either (a) ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe "
"interpretation of [the] TreatyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά; or "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λ(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the "
"institutions of the CommunityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 267 TFEU). In "
"other words, the ECJΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs role is to provide uniform and "
"authoritative interpretations of primary and secondary Community law. "
"Direct actions are those usually brought by the Commission against "
"various Member States that have failed to fulfil their obligations "
"under Community law (Article 258 TFEU), or by individuals seeking to "
"challenge the validity of EU legislation that affects them (Article "
"263TFEU).</p> <p>To help the Court of Justice cope with the large "
"number of cases brought before it, and to offer citizens better legal "
"protection, a ΓΆβ‚¬ΛCourt of First InstanceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"was created in 1989. This Court (which is attached to the Court of "
"Justice) is responsible for giving rulings on certain kinds of case, "
"particularly actions brought by private individuals, companies and "
"some organisations, and cases relating to competition law. In a "
"Protocol annexed to the <a href=\\treatyofnice.htm\\>Treaty of "
"Nice</a>, the Statute of the ECJ and the CFI was revised, and a number "
"of reforms were introduced. These included a redistribution of "
"responsibilities between the ECJ and the CFI whereby the CFI becomes "
"the ordinary court for all direct actions.</p> <p>A new judicial body, "
"the ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEuropean Civil Service TribunalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, "
"has been set up to adjudicate in disputes between the European Union "
"and its civil service. This tribunal is composed of seven judges and "
"is attached to the Court of First Instance.</p> <p>One of the major "
"changes in the judicial structure of the European courts envisaged by "
"the Treaty of Nice is the creation of specialised judicial panels to "
"hear cases in specific areas. Along these lines, the Treaty of Nice "
"enabled the Court to be granted jurisdiction in disputes relating to "
"Community industrial property rights (Article 262 TFEU). Allowing for "
"the creation of specialised tribunals means it is now possible, "
"following a practice in the Member States, that a specialised EU "
"tribunal could be created to deal with disputes in the field of "
"employment and industrial relations. It may be that a specialised "
"Labour Panel would be appropriate for cases raising issues of EU law "
"in the fields of employment and industrial relations. One such "
"specialised tribunal has been created to deal with cases involving "
"staff employed by the EU institutions.</p> <p>The ECJ is acknowledged "
"to have been the driving force in the emergence of a distinctive "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEuropean Union lawΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, separate from "
"both national laws and traditional international law. The Court "
"notably proclaimed this to be ΓΆβ‚¬Λa new legal "
"orderΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in <i>NV Algemene Transporten Expeditie "

"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/index_en.htm\\>European "
"economic governance</a> is defined by the <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/economy_finance/index_en.htm\\>Economic "
"and Financial Affairs Directorate General</a> of the European "
"Commission as a series of decisions aimed at strengthening economic "
"and budgetary coordination for the EU as a whole and for the euro area "
"in particular.</p> <p>Economic and fiscal governance measures have "
"been tightened in response to the continuing economic and financial "
"crisis in Europe which began in 2008. The aim is to enable economies "
"across the EU to be better placed to chart a path to growth and job "
"creation.</p> <p>The cornerstone of the EU response is a new set of "
"rules on enhanced <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/index_en.htm\\>EU "
"economic governance</a> which came into force on 13 December 2011. It "
"has four main components:</p> <ul> <li>stronger preventive action "
"through a reinforced Stability and Growth Pact (<a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/index_en.htm\\>SGP</a>) "
"and deeper fiscal coordination;</li> <li>stronger corrective action "
"through the reinforced SGP;</li> <li>minimum requirements for national "
"budgetary frameworks;</li> <li>preventing and correcting macroeconomic "
"and competitiveness imbalances.</li> </ul> <p>These four components "
"mean that Member States are now required to make significant progress "
"towards medium-term budgetary objectives (MTO) for their budgetary "
"balances.</p> <p>Part of the reinforced SGP is the launch of an "
"Excessive Deficit Procedure (<a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/deficit/index_en.htm\\>EDP</a>), "
"which can be put in place after taking account of government debt "
"developments as well as the government deficit. Member States with a "
"debt in excess of 60% of GDP should reduce their debt in line with a "
"numerical benchmark. Progressive financial sanctions now kick in at an "
"earlier stage of the EDP.</p> <p>Member States will be required to "
"ensure that their national budgetary frameworks are in line with "
"minimum quality standards and cover all administrative levels. "
"National fiscal planning should adopt a multi-annual perspective, so "
"as to attain the MTO.</p> <p>The Commission has stated that over the "
"past decade Member States have made economic choices which have led to "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λcompetitiveness divergencesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λmacroeconomic imbalancesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά within the "
"EU. In future, new surveillance mechanisms will aim to prevent and "
"correct such divergences. The Commission will rely on an alert system "
"that uses a scoreboard of indicators and in-depth country studies, "
"strict rules in the form of a new Excessive Imbalance Procedure (EIP) "
"and better enforcement in the form of financial sanctions for Member "
"States which do not follow up on recommendations.</p> <p>Individual "
"elements of European economic governance include:</p> <ul> <li>the <a "
"href=\\http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/119810.pdf\\>Euro "
"Plus Pact (148Kb PDF)</a>;</li> <li>the so-called ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/articles/governance/2012-03-14_six_pack_en.htm\\>six "
"pack</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά;</li> <li><a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/assistance_eu_ms/index_en.htm\\>specific "
"financial assistance</a> for individual EU Member States that are in "
"difficulties and request help from the EU;</li> <li>the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/treatyonstabilitycoordinationandgovernance.htm\\>Treaty "
"on Stability, Coordination and Governance</a>, known as the Fiscal "
"Treaty, which is an intergovernmental agreement signed by 25 EU Member "
"States on 2 March 2012.</li> </ul> <p>The Euro Plus Pact was signed in "
"March 2011 by 23 Member States to give further impetus to governance "
"reforms. The signatories included six countries from outside the euro "
"area: Bulgaria, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. The "
"Pact commits countries to stronger economic coordination for "
"competitiveness and convergence. Concrete goals are agreed and "
"reviewed on an annual basis by heads of state or governments. The Pact "
"is integrated into the <a href=\\europeansemester.htm\\>European "
"semester</a> cycle of policy governance, and the Commission monitors "
"the implementation of commitments.</p> <p>The ΓΆβ‚¬Λsix "
"packΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, which came into force in December 2011, "
"comprises five Regulations and one Directive. It covers fiscal and "
"macroeconomic surveillance under the new Macroeconomic Imbalance "
"Procedure (<a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/index_en.htm\\>MIP</a>) "
"and strengthens the EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Stability and Growth "
"Pact.</p> <p>Special financial assistance has so far gone to Greece, "
"Ireland, Latvia, Portugal, Romania and Spain. Such financial "
"assistance is accompanied by fiscal and economic measures that must be "
"implemented by the Member State. These arrangements are set out in "
"Troika Memoranda to the relevant Member State. The Troika comprises "
"the International Monetary Fund (<a "
"href=\\http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm\\>IMF</a>), European "
"Union (<a href=\\http://europa.eu/index_en.htm\\>EU</a>) and European "
"Central Bank (<a "
"href=\\http://www.ecb.int/home/html/index.en.html\\>ECB</a>).</p> "
"<p>The intergovernmental Fiscal Treaty demonstrates the willingness of "
"the Member States to enshrine the culture of financial stability in "
"their legislation, mirroring the EU fiscal rules at national level. "
"This means that if a country does not properly implement the new EU "
"budget rules in national law and fails to comply with a <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"(ECJ) ruling that requires it to do so, the ECJ can impose financial "
"sanctions. On 21 December 2012, Finland was the twelfth eurozone "
"Member State to ratify the Fiscal Treaty, meaning the Treaty entered "
"into force on 1 January 2013.</p> <p>These measures are likely to have "
"an impact on industrial relations in EU Member States. The tighter "
"macro-economic surveillance measures have become a factor in national "
"initiatives in the area of pay, wage indexation and employment, "
"triggering pay pauses, pay freezes and pay cuts, particularly in the "
"public sector.</p> <p>Cuts in employment in the public sector are also "
"being made in order to cut spending and reduce government debt, in "
"line with EU targets. They are also likely to accelerate existing "
"industrial relations trends in EU Member States, such as the "
"decentralisation of collective bargaining, deregulation of the labour "
"market and decreases in trade union density.</p> <p>There has also "
"been an impact on the process of collective bargaining. The need to "
"cut costs has driven an increase in flexibility, and this can been "
"seen in the decentralisation of bargaining in many countries. "
"Bargaining has moved from national to sectoral level, or from sectoral "
"to company level.</p> <p>The effects of these measures are also being "
"felt in terms of cuts in unemployment benefit and other welfare "
"benefits, and the development of more active labour market policies, "
"often targeting vulnerable groups.</p> <p>In some EU Member States, "
"the influence of the EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs new economic governance "
"measures is negligible, but in others ΓΆβ‚¬β€ particularly "
"those that have received targeted financial assistance from the EU "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the impact is severe.</p> <p>For more details on "
"the impact of European economic governance measures on industrial "
"relations in EU Member States, see the Eurofound report at <a "

"<br /> <p>The European Employment Strategy (EES) is a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛsoftΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά law mechanism designed to "
"coordinate the employment policies of the EU Member States. While the "
"objectives, priorities and targets are agreed at EU level, the "
"national governments are fully responsible for formulating and "
"implementing the necessary policies.</p> <h3>Historical "
"background</h3> <p>The Delors White Paper of 1993 on "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛGrowth, competitiveness, employment: the challenges and "
"ways forward into the 21st centuryΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά declared that "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λemployment was one of the most important areas of "
"concern of the ECΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and proposed ΓΆβ‚¬Λa "
"thorough-going reform of the labour marketΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The "
"European Council of 9ΓΆβ‚¬β€10 December 1994 in Essen "
"confirmed the EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs commitment to the promotion of "
"employment and agreed on five key objectives:</p> <ul> <li>the "
"development of resources through vocational training;</li> <li>the "
"promotion of productive investment through moderate wage "
"policies;</li> <li>the improvement of the efficiency of labour market "
"institutions;</li> <li>the identification of new sources of jobs "
"through local initiatives;</li> <li>the promotion of access to the "
"world of work for specific target groups (young people, long-term "
"unemployed, women).</li> </ul> <p>These objectives became known as the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEssen StrategyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά ΓΆβ‚¬β€ a "
"strategy of coordination of national employment policies aimed at "
"achieving the specified objectives. The insertion of a new <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/employmenttitle.htm\\>employment "
"title</a> into the EC Treaty (Articles 125ΓΆβ‚¬β€130 EC/now "
"Articles 145-150 TFEU), by the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/treatyofamsterdam.htm\\>Treaty "
"of Amsterdam</a>, institutionalised the EES. This step enshrined in "
"the Treaty the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/luxembourgprocess.htm\\>Luxembourg "
"process</a> (called after the Luxembourg ΓΆβ‚¬ΛJobs "
"summitΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of 1997). Article 148 TFEU provides for the "
"Council and Commission to draw up annual guidelines, which the Member "
"States ΓΆβ‚¬Λshall take into account in their employment "
"policiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, on the basis of which they are to make an "
"annual report. The Council and Commission may make (non-binding) "
"recommendations to Member States concerning their employment policies. "
"In 2000, the mid-term review of the Luxembourg process concluded that "
"a common, integrated framework for structural change was helping to "
"promote a mutually supportive synergy effect between different actors "
"at European and national levels.</p> <p>The implementation of the EES "
"through the Luxembourg process of the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/openmethodofcoordination.htm\\>open "
"method of coordination</a> (OMC) has various strengths: it is an "
"iterative process, carried out in a pluri-annual perspective, with a "
"set of guidelines including targets and deadlines, as well as a review "
"and evaluation procedure, which impacts on national administrations. "
"It is underpinned by five key factors: subsidiarity, convergence, "
"mutual learning, integrated approach and management by objectives.</p> "
"<p>In 2000, the Lisbon Presidency Conclusions called on the social "
"partners to play a role in the implementation of the EES. This was "
"reinforced at the Feira Council in 2000, which invited the social "
"partners ΓΆβ‚¬Λto play a more prominent role in implementing "
"and monitoring the guidelinesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Guidelines could "
"emerge from an EU-level social dialogue between the European social "
"partners with mandates from affiliated social partners drawing on "
"experience of national employment pacts or following on from proposals "
"by the Commission. Affiliated social partners at Member State level "
"could produce <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/nationalactionplans.htm\\>National "
"Action Plans</a> to implement the guidelines embodied in EU framework "
"agreements.</p> <p>The Commission has invested a large amount of both "
"time and resources in the development of the EES (including a major "
"impact evaluation in 2002). The EES has resulted in annual sets of "
"employment guidelines, the Member States have undertaken <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/nationalreformprogrammes.htm\\>National "
"Reform Programmes</a> (previously National Action Plans) on an annual "
"basis, annual joint employment reports have been produced, and "
"recommendations have emerged following the coming into force of the "
"Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May 1999. The annual employment guidelines "
"consistently posited four pillars: <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/adaptability.htm\\>adaptability</a>, "
"<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/entrepreneurship.htm\\>entrepreneurship</a>, "
"<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/equalopportunities.htm\\>equal "
"opportunities</a> and <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/employability.htm\\>employability</a>. "
"Since the 2003 guidelines, the four pillars have been replaced by "
"three main objectives: full employment, improving quality and "
"productivity at work, and strengthening social cohesion and inclusion "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ in the face of increased regional disparities after "
"the enlargement of the EU, the last item was changed into "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λstrengthening social and territorial cohesion\\' in the "
"2005ΓΆβ‚¬β€2008 employment guidelines. The National Reform "
"Programmes were based on a new set of 24 <a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/employment_and_social_policy/community_employment_policies/c11323_en.htm\\>Integrated "
"Guidelines for Growth and Jobs Policy 2005ΓΆβ‚¬β€2008</a> "
"and aimed to show how the guidelines were put into practice at the "
"national level. They had to set out the policy responses to the key "
"macroeconomic, microeconomic and employment policy priorities in one "
"document. The NRPs also drew on a number of OMC processes. The "
"involvement of the social partners was seen as essential to achieving "
"the objectives.</p> <h3>Recent EES developments</h3> <p>The "
"enlargement process of the EU to 25 Member States in 2004 (and to 27 "
"in 2007) has proved one of the major challenges for the EES during the "
"last few years. The preparation for full membership of the EES via "
"Joint Action Plans proved to be a helpful instrument to ensure a "
"smooth integration of the new Member States. Candidate countries had "
"the opportunity to adjust their institutions and policies to the "
"European Employment Strategy, thus allowing the full implementation of "
"the Employment Title of the Treaty from accession.</p> <p>The EES has "
"also proved to be an important policy instrument as an integral part "
"of the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/lisbonstrategy.htm\\>Lisbon "
"strategy</a>. Following Wim KokΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs sombre review of "
"the Lisbon strategy in 2005, the Commission was further forced to "
"reconfirm its support for the EES and announce the need to implement "
"measures to improve the synergy effect between EU and the national "
"action plans. The re-launching of the Lisbon strategy saw the European "
"Council approve changes to EU guidelines which would affect the EES. "
"In particular, this concerned the integration of macro-economic, "
"micro-economic and employment policies for growth and jobs "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ producing one set of guidelines to cover all three "
"areas. A further step undertaken to reinvigorate the EES involved the "
"unveiling of the 2007ΓΆβ‚¬β€2013 cohesion policy in 2006. "
"The main feature of this new <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docoffic/official/reports/pdf/interim4/4inter_en.pdf#search=the "
"growth jobs strategy\\>policy</a> involves the importance placed on "
"encouraging Member States to submit National Strategic Reference "
"Frameworks that promote growth and better jobs. These new developments "
"address previous concerns that the EES was being undermined by its "
"uncertain relation to macroeconomic policy and the scarcity of "
"financial support for innovative developments.</p> <p>In 2005, the "
"Commission launched a new <a "
"href=\\http://www.mutual-learning-employment.net/\\>programme of "
"Mutual Learning</a> centred on the exchange of good practice and the "
"dissemination of the experiences with the EES. In parallel, the "
"Commission adopted a Community Lisbon Programme with around 100 "
"EU-level measures in July 2005. In January 2006, the Commission "
"presented the first <a "
"href=\\http://www.central2013.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Downloads/Tools_Resources/Lisbon_MEMO-06-23_EN_1_.pdf\\>annual "
"progress report</a> in line with the revised Lisbon Strategy.</p> "

"the 2009 Eurofound report, EFAs are also more diverse than IFAs, both "
"in terms of content and procedure. EWCs play an important role in the "
"negotiation and signature of these agreements, and have signed a large "

"<br /> <p>The European Globalisation adjustment Fund (EGF), unlike the "
"<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeansocialfund.htm\\>European "
"Social Fund</a> (ESF), comes under Article 175 TFEU. While "
"complementing other existing policies and financial instruments to "
"address problems associated with globalisation (such as structural "
"funds), the objective of the EGF <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_406/l_40620061230en00010006.pdf\\>Regulation "
"(EC) No 1927/2006</a> (73 Kb PDF) is quite different. In contrast to "
"the ESF, for example, the EGF is not designed as an annual programme "
"to ensure the anticipation, adaptation and positive management of "
"change in a global economic environment. The EGF regulation states "
"that this new funding channel represents a one-off specific funding "
"opportunity to assist individual employees adversely affected by "
"globalisation due to economic delocalisation, a high increase in "
"imports and a decline in EU exports. The Commission was aware that the "
"negative effects sometimes associated with globalisation could put "
"into question what is commonly referred to as the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeansocialmodel.htm\\>European "
"Social Model</a>, a system that promotes sustainable economic growth, "
"<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/socialdialogue.htm\\>social "
"dialogue</a>, <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/equalopportunities.htm\\>equal "
"opportunities</a> and good employment terms and conditions.</p> <p>The "
"EGF is designed to address what the European Union refers to as the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛasymmetryΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά between the benefits (job "
"growth and competitiveness) and adverse effects (redundancy and "
"decline employment terms and conditions). This new funding channel "
"owes its existence to a Commission Communication published in October "
"2005, <a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/employment_and_social_policy/social_agenda/c10150_en.htm\\>European "
"values in a globalised world</a> (COM (2005) 525 final; 285 Kb PDF). "
"Arguing that ΓΆβ‚¬ΛfairnessΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/solidarityprinciple.htm\\>solidarity</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"were intrinsic values of the European Union, the head of the European "
"Commission, President Barroso, endorsed the need to provide financial "
"assistance to employees negatively affected by trade liberalisation. "
"This involved the Commission sending a letter to the Presidents of the "
"EU Council and the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeanparliament.htm\\>European "
"Parliament</a> outlining the benefits of the EGF. In addition, the "
"Commission consulted the social dialogue committee. At a subsequent "
"European Council meeting in December 2005, Heads of State agreed to "
"the establishment of the EGF.</p> <p>In operation since January 2007, "
"the EGF has a budget of ΓΆβ€Β¬500 million a year. To benefit "
"from the EGF, certain conditions have to be fulfilled. For example, "
"Article 2 (a) of the regulation states that a minimum of at least "
"1,000 employees have to have been made redundant in a company or "
"Member State (including employees in suppliers or downstream "
"producers) over a period of four months. The period of redundancy "
"increases to nine months under Article 2 (b) where this involves <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/smallandmediumsizedenterprise.htm\\>small "
"and medium-sized enterprises</a> (SMEs) in a NACE 2 sector or in one "
"or two regions at NUTS II level. In addition, where the above criteria "
"are not fulfilled, Article 2 (c) will consider funding programmes in "
"the case of small markets and exceptional circumstances. When applying "
"for funding, the Member State has to: demonstrate the link between "
"planned redundancies and economic global structural changes; identify "
"the affected enterprise and <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/worker.htm\\>worker</a>; "
"identify the territory affected and the impact redundancies will have "
"on local and regional employment; and discuss the procedures used to "
"consult the social partners.</p> <p>The application has also to show "
"that an accredited authority has designed a relevant programme to "
"support the re-entry of workers into the labour market. After "
"positively assessing the validity of an application, the budgeting "
"authorities can agree to finance up to 50% of a "
"programmeΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs overall costs.</p> <p>Although the "
"Commission originally estimated that the current EGF budget could "
"support between 35,000 and 50,000 workers a year, a key finding of the "
"2007 <a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/464&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en\\>annual "
"report</a>, published on 2 July 2008, demonstrates that the fund has "
"had a modest impact. To date, EGF has helped a mere 15,000 workers "
"back into the labour market. These include workers from Finland, "
"France, Germany, Malta and Portugal. In response, the European "
"Commission plans to look at ways of raising the "
"fundΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs profile within Member States and to highlight "
"how such a policy initiative can benefit workers who are affected by "
"the negative consequences of globalisation.</p> <p>The type of action "
"that the EGF can fund involves:</p> <ul> <li>job-search assistance, "
"occupational guidance, tailor-made training and re-training including "
"ICT skills and certification of acquired experience, outplacement "
"assistance and entrepreneurship promotion or aid for "
"self-employment;</li> <li>special time-limited measures, such as "
"job-search allowances, <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/mobilityofworkers.htm\\>mobility</a> "
"allowances or allowances to individuals participating in <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/lifelonglearning.htm\\>lifelong "
"learning</a> and training activities;</li> <li>measures to stimulate "
"in particular disadvantaged or older workers, to remain in or return "
"to the labour market.</li> </ul> <p>The EGF provides a potential role "
"for trade unions in the management of EGF programmes and this could a "
"crucial factor in successful implementation. Findings of a <a "
"href=\\http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/expert/eStudies/download.do?file=17215\\>study</a> "
"conducted for the European Parliament suggest that trade unions have a "
"critical role to play in helping employees re-enter the labour market "
"after being made redundant.</p><br /> <div style=\\font-size: 10px; "

"\\n"
"        <p>The project of creating a European labour market is quite "
"different from the objectives associated with national labour market "
"regulation, where\\n"
"        employment protection and industrial relations are the chief "
"concerns. The aim to establish a free movement of workers provided the "
"major context of\\n"
"        regulation of the European labour market since the foundation "
"of the European Economic Community in 1957.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The demographic profile of the European labour market has "
"changed significantly in recent years. The proportion of the labour "
"force that is female\\n"
"        has increased over the last decade, with the gender gap "
"between men and women falling from 17.1 percentage points in 2000 to "
"14.2 percentage points in\\n"
"        2007. Migration now shapes the European labour market, and the "
"accession of the new Member States in 2004 and in 2007 has utilised "
"the right to free\\n"
"        movement of workers to encourage changes in the national and "
"ethnic profile of the European labour market. Demographic changes "
"associated with an aging\\n"
"        labour force have also necessitated new labour market "
"incentives to encourage older workers to remain in the labour force "
"for longer.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>In relation to the nature of labour market regulation in "
"the EU, this too has been the subject of change. In its original form "
"it may best be\\n"
"        understood by contrasting it with another form of "
"transnational labour regulation: the <a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/\\>International Labour\\n"
"        Organization</a> (ILO). Established in 1919, the ILO declared "
"as one of its principles that ΓΆβ‚¬Λlabour should not be "
"regarded merely as a commodity or\\n"
"        article of commerceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 427 of the "
"Treaty of Versailles, 1919, which contained the first ILO "
"Constitution). In contrast, labour ΓΆβ‚¬β€ and even more\\n"
"        so, social matters ΓΆβ‚¬β€ were relatively marginal "
"to the original objectives of the European Economic Community. In "
"terms of their content, the development\\n"
"        of labour market regulation during almost five decades of "
"existence of the EU has been spasmodic, episodic and unsystematic, "
"ranging from norms\\n"
"        guaranteeing free movement of workers in a Community-wide "
"labour market, to norms providing rights and protection far beyond "
"existing Member State\\n"
"        provisions (as in equality between women and men). However, "
"the mechanisms of enforcement through EC law extend far beyond the "
"possibilities available\\n"
"        to the ILO. These qualities of content and procedures of "
"adoption and enforcement of norms are important to an understanding of "
"the specificity of EC\\n"
"        labour market regulation.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Despite the limitations of its original common labour "
"market objective, EU regulation of the labour market did develop "
"beyond the confines of free\\n"
"        movement of workers. A major driving force was the interaction "

"The Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) represent all of the "

"ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs legislative role, there are different "
"legislative procedures depending on the subject being proposed. "
"Originally, the Parliament had only a consultative role. However, "
"under the ΓΆβ‚¬Λconsultation procedureΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, "
"failure to consult the Parliament made the proposed legislation void "

"C-138/79</a> [1980]). Following the coming into force of the <a "
"href=\\singleeuropeanact.htm\\>Single European Act</a> 1986, the "
"Parliament was given the power to reject proposals. Where it did so, "
"under the ΓΆβ‚¬Λcooperation procedureΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, the "
"Council could thereafter only approve the previously rejected proposal "
"by a unanimous vote rather than by a qualified majority.</p> <p>In "
"addition, the Parliament received the right to veto on the accession "
"of new Member States and assent to international agreements alongside "
"the Council. Under the <a href=\\treatyofmaastricht.htm\\>Treaty of "
"Maastricht</a>, ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs legislative powers were "
"extended under the <a href=\\codecisionprocedure.htm\\>co-decision "
"procedure</a>. The Parliament now has the right to veto legislation by "
"absolute majority. Such power prevents the Council from enacting "
"legislation without the ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs consent. The <a "
"href=\\treatyofamsterdam.htm\\>Treaty of Amsterdam</a> reduced the "
"scope of application of the cooperation procedure and extended the "
"co-decision procedure, which was further extended by the <a "
"href=\\treatyofnice.htm\\>Treaty of Nice</a>. However, the Parliament "
"still does not have the power to enact legislation by itself.</p> "
"<p>The <a href=\\treatyoflisbon.htm\\>Treaty of Lisbon</a>, which "
"entered into force on 1 December 2009, again strengthened the rights "
"of the European Parliament. In legislation the \\'co-decision "
"procedure\\' (now \\'ordinary legislative procedure\\') was extended "
"to new fields. This implies that Parliament now has similar "
"legislative powers as the Council in some areas where it used to be "
"merely consulted or not involved at all. These areas include legal "
"immigration, penal judicial cooperation (Eurojust, crime prevention, "
"alignment of prison standards, offences and penalties), police "
"cooperation (Europol) and some aspects of trade policy and "
"agriculture. With regard to its budgetary powers the Lisbon Treaty "
"confirmed the established practice of working with a multiannual "
"financial framework, which Parliament must approve. It also abolished "
"the former distinction between \\'compulsory\\' expenditure (like "
"direct income support to farmers) and \\'non-compulsory\\' "
"expenditure, with the result that Parliament and the Council determine "
"all expenditure together. With regard to international agreements the "
"European Parliament\\'s assent is required for all international "
"agreements in fields governed by the ordinary legislative "
"procedure.The social dialogue process introduced under the <a "
"href=\\agreementonsocialpolicy.htm\\>Agreement on Social Policy</a>, "
"currently in Articles 154-155 TFEU, initially provided for the "
"adoption of legislation on social policy without the formal "
"involvement of the Parliament. The Lisbon Treaty introduced the "
"novelty that the European Parliament shall be informed (Article 155(2) "
"TFEU) of the outcomes of the European social dialogue, a procedure "
"which was already followed in practice in recent years.</p> <p>The "
"ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs supervisory role should be seen in the "
"context of the doctrine of separation of powers within the EU. The "
"Treaty seeks to establish a system of checks and balances by way of "
"supervision. Parliament has the right, by two-thirds majority, to pass "
"a motion of censure against the Commission. It can question both the "
"Commission and the Council, through question time with Commissioners "
"and officials. It can establish committees of inquiry, normally "
"through its Ombudsman, to investigate cases of poor administration. "
"The Treaty of Nice granted Parliament the right to institute "
"proceedings before the European Court seeking to review acts of the "
"institutions (Article 263 TFEU).</p> <p>Much of the "
"ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs work is done through committees. While "

"<br /> <p>A European private company is a legal form for limited "

"facilitate their cross-border activities. Like the European company "
"statute, it is expected to contain provisions to protect the "
"involvement of employees. It is referred to as SPE, after its Latin "
"name, <i>Societas Privata Europaea</i>. According to the proposed "
"regulation, entrepreneurs should be able to set up their business in "
"the form of an SPE following the same company law rules throughout the "

"Commission</a> launched its proposal for a Council Regulation on the "

"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/docs/epc/proposal_en.pdf\\>document "
"COM(2008) 396/3</a>). On 10 March 2009, the European Parliament "
"adopted a <a "
"href=\\http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2009-0094+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN\\>report</a> "
"on the European Private Company to complement the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs proposal.</p> <p>According to the "
"Commission proposal, the SPE statute is suitable for any company "
"having a legal persona and limited liability share capital&nbsp;which "
"does not offer its shares to the public. An SPE company would be able "
"to have its offices in any Member State and transfer it to any other "
"Member State without having to move its central headquarters.</p> "
"<p>The report by the European Parliament, adopted in 2009, proposes a "
"set of amendments to the Commission proposal, aimed at avoiding a "
"situation whereby firms use the SPE statute to circumvent pre-existing "
"<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/worker.htm\\>workers</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"rights. The text proposed by the European Parliament states that each "
"SPE should apply the rules on employee <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/participation.htm\\>participation</a> "
"applicable in the Member State in which it has its registered office. "
"In the event of a company transfer, the rules of the country of "
"registration would continue to apply, unless one-fourth of the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/employee.htm\\>employees</a> "
"(for firms with more than 1,000 employees) habitually work in a Member "
"State (or Member States) which provides a greater level of employee "
"participation. For companies with fewer than 1,000 workers, this "
"threshold is set at one-third. In this case, the European Parliament "
"envisages negotiations between the management of the firm and "
"employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representatives aimed at reaching an "
"agreement on employee involvement. At this point, the report "
"explicitly refers to the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeancompany.htm\\>European "
"Company</a> Directive.</p> <p>In order to avoid misuse, in particular "
"with regard to workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά participation, the European "
"ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs report includes an obligation for the "
"SPE to demonstrate a cross-border component. This could mean, for "
"example,&nbsp;having a business objective covering more than one "
"Member State or subsidiaries established in several EU countries. "
"Within two years of registration, the Commission and Member States "
"should conduct ex-post monitoring in order to examine whether the EPC "
"has the required cross-border component. Further amendments aimed at "
"avoiding misuse concern minimum capital requirements and checks on "
"registration.</p> <p>Despite these amendments proposed by the European "
"Parliament, <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/tradeunions.htm\\>trade "
"unions</a> still see the need for a more precise regulation of "
"employee participation in order to avoid the risk of creating a "
"European reference model for company law, which might put pressure on "
"national company law regimes. In this context, the core points to be "
"addressed relate to the need for clear provisions regarding the "
"cross-border component, the corporate governance structure, the duty "
"of directors to take into consideration the interests of all "
"stakeholders, as well as the duty to conduct negotiations on employee "
"participation when founding an SPE.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) acts as a "
"translation device to make national qualifications more readable "
"across Europe, promoting workers\\' and learners\\' mobility between "
"countries and facilitating their <a "
"href=\\lifelonglearning.htm\\>lifelong learning</a>.</p> <p>The <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/education/pub/pdf/general/eqf/broch_en.pdf\\>European "
"Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning (EQF)</a> was adopted "
"on the basis of a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the "
"Council on 23 April 2008. The recommendation is non-binding and "
"conforms to the principle of <a "
"href=\\subsidiarity.htm\\>subsidiarity</a> by supporting and "
"supplementing Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά activities and by "
"facilitating further co-operation between them to increase "
"transparency and to promote <a href=\\mobilityofworkers.htm\\>mobility "
"of workers</a> and lifelong learning. The EQF encourages countries to "
"relate their qualifications systems or frameworks to the EQF and to "
"ensure that all new qualifications issued from 2012 carry a reference "
"to the appropriate EQF level.</p> <p>At the core of the EQF are eight "
"reference levels describing what a learner knows, understands and is "
"able to do ΓΆβ‚¬β€ \\'learning outcomes\\'. National "
"qualifications will be placed at one of the central reference levels, "
"ranging from basic (Level 1) to advanced (Level 8). The recommendation "
"states that this will make it easier to compare national "
"qualifications and should also mean that people will not have to "
"repeat learning should they move to another country. The EQF applies "
"to all types of education, training and qualifications, from school "
"education to academic, professional and vocational.</p> <p>The context "
"for the recommendation can be found in the <a "
"href=\\lisbonstrategy.htm\\>Lisbon Strategy</a> calling for increased "
"transparency of qualifications. Furthermore <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002G0709(01):EN:NOT\\>Council "
"Resolution of 27 June 2002 on Lifelong Learning</a> called for a "
"framework for the recognition of both education and training "
"qualifications and this was again stressed in the joint reports of the "
"Council and the Commission <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/2010/doc/compendium05_en.pdf\\>Education "
"and Training 2010 (96Kb PDF)</a>.</p> <p>The object of the "
"recommendation is to create a common reference framework to serve as a "
"translation device between different qualifications systems and their "
"levels. The aim is to improve the transparency, comparability and "
"portability of citizensΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά qualifications as well as to "
"enable international sectoral organisations to relate their "
"qualification systems to a common European reference point. The "
"recommendation does not replace or define national qualifications.</p> "

"<br /> <p>The sectoral organisation of employers at EU level is much "

"cross-industry organisations of employers dominate, there are sectoral "

"recognised as sectoral social partners 62 organisations representing "

"European Construction Industry Federation (<a "

"dialogue with the European Federation of Building and Wood Workers, "
"the EU-level sectoral organisation of workers in the construction "
"industry. FIEC is recognised as representative by the Commission, "
"although it does not represent small and medium firms in every Member "

"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/treatyofmaastricht.htm\\>Treaty "
"on European Union</a> (TEU) as one of the sources inspiring the social "
"objectives of the EU. The Preamble to the TEU also speaks of the "
"Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά wish to confirm ΓΆβ‚¬Λtheir "
"attachment to fundamental social rights as defined in the European "
"Social Charter signed at Turin on 18 October "
"1961ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>The Council of Europe ΓΆβ‚¬β€ "
"established in 1949 and having as one of its objectives the promotion "
"of human rights ΓΆβ‚¬β€ adopted the European Social Charter "
"in 1961; it was revised in 1996. All EU Member States are Members of "
"the Council of Europe and have ratified the European Social Charter. "
"The Charter includes <a href=\\fundamentalrights.htm\\>fundamental "
"rights</a> in the field of social policy generally (health, social "
"security, welfare), and specifically in the fields of employment and "
"industrial relations, including the rights to work, to just conditions "
"of work, to a fair remuneration and to organise and bargain "
"collectively. It was the first international treaty expressly "
"recognising the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/righttostrike.htm\\>right "
"to strike</a>.</p> <p>States who ratify the Charter accept at least "
"five of the seven core Articles of the Charter: the rights to work, "
"organise, bargain collectively, social security, social and medical "
"assistance, rights of the family to social, legal and medical "
"protection and the protection of migrant workers. In addition, they "
"undertake to be bound by at least 10 of the 19 articles in Part II or "
"by 45 of the 72 numbered paragraphs.</p> <p>The enforcement machinery "
"of the Charter is very different from that of the parallel instrument "
"of the Council of Europe in the field of human rights, namely the "
"European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). While the ECHR allows for "
"individual complaints to the European Court of Human Rights, the "
"European Social Charter relies instead on supervision of practices "
"through scrutiny of the regular reports submitted by the states to a "
"committee of independent experts, the European Committee of Social "
"Rights. On the basis of the assessment by the European Committee of "
"Social Rights, a government committee proposes to the Committee of "
"Ministers to issue recommendations requesting (particular) States to "
"bring national law and practice into conformity with the Charter. "
"Moreover, in November 1995, an additional protocol was added to the "
"Charter providing, when ratified, for a system of collective "
"complaints by international and national organisations of employers "
"and trade unions and international non-governmental organisations.</p> "
"<p>This enforcement system does not depend on the willingness or "
"availability of resources of an individual complainant and it is "
"policy-oriented and might thus provide a broader perspective than a "
"case-based procedure. However, it remains to be seen to what extent "
"states are willing to respect the recommendations, which have not the "
"same sanctioned legal force as a decision of the European Court of "
"Human Rights.</p> <p>To mark the 50th anniversary of the Charter, the "
"European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) adopted in October 2011 a <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/IMG/pdf/EN-Declaration_50_Anniversary_ESC_adopted_resolution.pdf\\>Resolution</a> "
"taking stock of the protection afforded to fundamental workers\\' "
"rights by the Charter, particularly in the light of the economic "
"crisis that began in 2008. The Resolution reviews progress and "
"highlights areas where improvements could be made. Overall, the ETUC "
"believes that the current economic and financial crisis has led to "
"fundamental rights being undermined, and that there are issues "
"relating to the effectiveness of fundamental social rights, "
"particularly in areas such as the right to collective action. It also "
"believes that the supervisory system of the Charter is not functioning "
"as well it should: the number of individual recommendations (which are "
"the most severe consequences in cases of non-conformity with the "
"CharterΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs provisions) has fallen almost to zero in "
"recent years (see also <a "

"<br /> <p>The term social dialogue is mentioned in primary <a "
"href=\\eulaw.htm\\>EU law</a> in the <a "
"href=\\treatyonthefunctioningoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Treaty on the "
"Functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU). Article 152 TFEU states: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe Union recognises and promotes the role of the "
"social partners at its level, taking into account the diversity of "
"national systems. It shall facilitate dialogue between the social "
"partners, respecting their autonomy.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Articles 154 "
"and 155 TFEU further provide a procedure that combines the "
"consultation of the social partners by the Commission with the option "
"to leave social regulation to bipartite agreement between <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/managementandlabour.htm\\>management "
"and labour</a> organised at European level. Article 154(2) states that "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λbefore submitting proposals in the social policy field, "
"the Commission shall consult management and labour on the possible "
"direction of Union action.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Article 154(3) states "
"that ΓΆβ‚¬Λif, after such consultation, the Commission "
"considers Union action advisable, it shall consult management and "
"labour on the content of the envisaged proposal. Management and labour "
"shall forward to the Commission an opinion or, where appropriate, a "
"recommendation.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>Article 155(1) provides the "
"procedure for EU-level social partner agreements, stating that "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λshould management and labour so desire, the dialogue "
"between them at Union level may lead to contractual relations, "
"including agreements.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά In the course of the "
"consultation, the social partners also address the question posed by "
"Article 154 (4) TFEU: whether they wish to initiate the process "
"provided for in Article 155 TFEU ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the bipartite "
"social dialogue ΓΆβ‚¬β€ which may lead to contractual "
"relations, including agreements. Article 155(2) states that "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λagreements concluded at Union level shall be "
"implemented either in accordance with the procedures and practices "
"specific to management and labour and the Member States or, in matters "
"covered by Article 153, at the joint request of the signatory parties, "
"by a Council decision on a proposal from the "
"Commission.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>The forms and content of the "
"responses of the social partners in this consultation phase may be "
"very different. The Commission suggests that the ΓΆβ‚¬Λformal "
"consultation of the social partners provided for in Article 154(3) "
"TFEU may lead to the adoption of opinions, recommendations or "
"agreement-based relations (including agreements) within the social "
"partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά sphere of competenceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. If "
"the social partners ask to deal with the issue by bipartite social "
"dialogue, known as the autonomous route, the Commission will suspend "
"its legislative initiative. An <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/autonomousagreement.htm\\>autonomous "
"agreement</a> is guided by the principle of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/subsidiarity.htm\\>subsidiarity</a>, "
"empowering national affiliates with the task of implementing such an "
"agreement in line with national procedures and practices. "
"Alternatively, Article 155(2) TFEU allows social partners to request "
"that the Commission take a proposal to the Council, which leads in "
"practice to implementation by Council directive, including all legal "
"consequences specific to the instrument of a directive. However, "
"should the social partners fail to reach an agreement, a fall back "
"position exists which allows the Commission to address the issue via "
"the normal legislative procedure, as famously occurred in the case of "
"the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeanworkscouncils.htm\\>European "
"Works Council Directive</a> in 1994.</p> <h3>Notions of European "
"social dialogue</h3> <p>The European social partners use a very narrow "
"definition, since they reserve the notion of social dialogue for their "
"bipartite, autonomous work. Whenever European public authorities are "
"involved, the social partners prefer to speak of tripartite "
"concertation.</p> <p>The European Commission sees social dialogue as "
"encompassing both the bipartite and the tripartite processes between "
"the European social partners themselves and between the two sides of "
"industry and the Commission. These processes are rooted in Articles "
"154 and 155 TFEU and may lead to legally or contractually binding "
"agreements. At European level, social dialogue takes two main forms: a "
"bipartite dialogue between the European employers and trade union "
"organisations, and a tripartite dialogue involving interaction between "
"the social partners and the public authorities.</p> <table "

"and globalisationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (COM (2002) 341 final of 26 June "
"2002). For this reason, the Commission is committed to establishing "
"more committees in order to ensure that all the main sectors are "

"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=480&amp;langId=en\\>sectoral "
"social dialogue committees</a>, which have produced a variety of joint "
"texts and agreements, covering over 6 million companies and 145 "
"million workers in a range of sectors. The most recent social dialogue "

"indication of the social partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά increasing "
"interest in European sectoral social dialogue. In terms of outcomes, "
"the number of texts adopted in the committees is extremely stable. "
"With regard to the topics covered, an analysis of the texts shows the "

"<br /> <p>Article 155 (2) TFEU provides two ways to implement EU <a "
"href=\\socialdialogue.htm\\>social dialogue</a> agreements: either by "
"implementation via Council Directive, or ΓΆβ‚¬Λin accordance "
"with the procedures and practices specific to management and labour "
"and the Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, the so-called "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λvoluntary routeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>This dual "
"process of implementation of European social dialogue agreements "
"signals emphatically the European social dialogueΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"industrial relations origins. The first and second mechanisms of "
"Article 155(2) TFEU may be seen as functionally equivalent: the first "
"uses constitutional mechanisms of EU legislation to require Member "
"States to implement agreements and the second uses industrial "
"relations mechanisms to articulate the EU social dialogue with "
"national collective bargaining systems to achieve <i>erga omnes</i> "
"effects. Yet, both are essentially extension mechanisms for EU level "
"social dialogue agreements: that is their function. The genius of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEuropeanΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά labour law was creatively to "
"develop a synthesis of the different conceptual apparatuses of "
"industrial relations and constitutional law appropriate to achieve "
"this function in the evolving European social dialogue.</p> <h3>By "
"Council Directive</h3> <p>The implementation of agreements resulting "
"from <a href=\\europeansocialdialogue.htm\\>European social "
"dialogue</a> is laid down in Article 155(2) TFEU: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛAgreements concluded at Community level shall be "
"implemented either in accordance with the procedures and practices "
"specific to management and labour and the Member States or, in matters "
"covered by Article 153, at the joint request of the signatory parties, "
"by a Council decision on a proposal from the Commission. The European "
"Parliament shall be informed.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά The very last sentence "
"regarding the involvement of the European Parliament was introduced by "
"the Treaty of Lisbon.</p> <p>The second option leads in practice to "
"implementation of the European collective agreement by Council "
"Directive. This option is only open ΓΆβ‚¬Λin matters covered "
"by Article 153ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, i.e. in social matters for which the "
"EU has regulatory competence.</p> <p>The <a "
"href=\\europeansocialpartners.htm\\>European social partners</a> who "
"signed the agreement will ask the Commission to propose to the Council "
"the implementation of the agreement. The Commission provides an "
"explanatory memorandum on any proposal presented to the Council, "
"giving its comments and assessment of the agreement concluded by the "

"href=\\frameworkagreements.htm\\>framework agreements</a> by Council "
"Directive with the normal legislative process. This vision has "
"important constitutional implications. According to the CFI, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe principle of democracy on which the Union is "
"founded requires ΓΆβ‚¬β€ in the absence of the "
"participation of the European Parliament in the legislative process "
"[as is the case when implementing collective agreements by Council "
"Directive on the basis of Article 155 (2) TFEU] ΓΆβ‚¬β€ "
"that the participation of the people be otherwise assured, in this "
"instance through the parties representative of management and labour "
"who concluded the agreementΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. In order to make sure "
"that that requirement is complied with, the Commission and the Council "
"are ΓΆβ‚¬Λunder a duty to verify that the signatories to the "
"agreement are truly representative.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά While the CFI "
"identifies the social partners as bearing the representative value "
"ensuring respect of the democratic principle, it also stresses the "
"importance of the EU institutions in scrutinising the European social "
"partners and the legitimacy of agreements in order to be implemented "
"by Council Directive.</p> <p>This view on the social dialogue has been "
"criticised as not respecting the autonomy of the social partners and "
"ignoring the fact that Article 155 TFEU has its conceptual roots not "
"exclusively in the political legal traditions of constitutional "
"arrangements but also in those of industrial relations.</p> <p>Thus, "
"it has been argued that, rather than equating implementation of "
"collective agreements by Council Directive with the normal legislative "
"process, the social dialogue procedure of Article 155 TFEU (with both "
"its ΓΆβ‚¬Λvoluntary routeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λimplementation by Council decisionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά) "
"should be considered as distinctive from the normal legislative "
"procedure (Article 153 TFEU) due to its particular conceptual roots in "
"industrial relations.</p> <h3>By the ΓΆβ‚¬Λvoluntary "
"routeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</h3> <p>The Commission has set out its view on "
"this voluntary route in its first Communication on the European social "
"dialogue (COM (93) 600 final, Brussels, 14 December 1993). The "
"Commission appeared to regard the obligatory implementation of social "
"dialogue agreements required by Article 155(2) TFEU as consisting of "
"the fact only that, ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe terms of this agreement will "
"bind their members and will affect only them and only in accordance "
"with the practices and procedures specific to them in their respective "
"Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>This recognition by the "
"Commission of the legally binding articulation of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λagreements concluded at Community "
"levelΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά with ΓΆβ‚¬Λprocedures and practices "
"specific to management and labourΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is important. "
"However, it appears to limit coverage to those who are party to the "
"collective agreements, a view articulated by the Member States in a "
"Declaration they attached to Article 139 (2) EC) (now 155(2) "
"TFEU):</p> <p><i>The [Member States declare] that the first of the "
"arrangements for application of the agreements between management and "
"labour at Community level ΓΆβ‚¬β€ referred to in Article "
"[139(2) EC] ΓΆβ‚¬β€ will consist in developing, by "
"collective bargaining according to the rules of each Member State, the "
"content of the agreements, and that consequently this arrangement "
"implies no obligation on the Member States to apply the agreements "
"directly or to work out rules for their transposition, nor any "
"obligation to amend national legislation in force to facilitate their "
"implementation.</i></p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>As part of the policy of promoting the engagement of the "
"European social partners in the formulation of EU social policy, "
"Articles 154-155 TFEU (previously 138-139 of the EC Treaty) provide a "
"procedure that combines the consultation of the social partners by the "
"Commission with the option to leave social regulation to bipartite "
"agreement between <a href=\\managementandlabour.htm\\>management and "
"labour</a> organised at European level. According to Article 154 TFEU, "
"the Commission, before submitting proposals in the social policy "
"field, has to consult management and labour on the possible direction "
"of that Community action. Moreover, if, after such consultation, the "
"Commission considers Community action advisable, it is obliged to "
"consult management and labour on the content of the envisaged "
"proposal.</p> <p>The Commission, in its <i>Communication concerning "
"the application of the Agreement on Social Policy</i> (COM (93) 600 "
"final, Brussels, 14 December 1993), indicated that "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λmanagement and labourΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά are to be "
"understood as the European social partner organisations, organised "
"cross-industry or by sector. It defined criteria of representativeness "
"and drew up a list (subject to regular revision) of organisations to "
"be consulted under Article 154 TFEU, which currently consists of 57 "
"organisations. In the course of the consultation, the social partners "
"also address the question posed by Article 154 (4) TFEU: whether they "
"wish to initiate the process provided for in Article 155 TFEU "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the bipartite social dialogue, which may lead to "
"contractual relations, including agreements.</p> <p>The forms and "
"contents of the responses of the social partners in this consultation "
"phase may be very different. The Commission suggests that, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe formal consultation of the social partners provided "
"for in Article [154 (3) TFEU] may lead to the adoption of opinions, "
"recommendations or agreement-based relations (including agreements) "
"within the social partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά sphere of "
"competenceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>If the social partners ask to "
"deal with the issue by bipartite social dialogue, the Commission will "
"suspend its legislative initiative. The bipartite dialogue may lead to "
"contractual relations, including agreements (Article 155 (1) TFEU). If "
"the social partners do not reach an agreement, the Commission can "
"still decide to tackle the issue via the normal legislative procedure. "
"If the social partners do reach an agreement, Article 155 (2) provides "
"two ways to ensure its implementation: the ΓΆβ‚¬Λvoluntary "
"routeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά relying on national procedures and practices "
"specific to management and labour and the Member States; or the route "
"via ΓΆβ‚¬Λimplementation by Council "
"decisionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, which leads in practice to implementation "
"by Council Directive including all legal consequences specific to the "
"instrument of a directive. The procedures of Article 154-155 TFEU can "
"be used to arrive at both intersectoral and sectoral agreements. For "
"both types of agreements, implementation by Council decision or "
"implementation via the voluntary route is possible.</p> <p>The "
"European social dialogue has led to both intersectoral and sectoral "
"European collective agreements. Its outcomes are modest if compared to "
"national systems of collective bargaining and social dialogue. Yet, "
"the European social dialogue is a process that stipulates a "
"relationship between collective bargaining and law specific to the EU "
"that cannot simply be equated with such systems at the national level. "
"First, it implies a flexible relationship between social dialogue at "
"all levels and is contingent upon national traditions of social "
"dialogue within the Member States. Second, collective bargaining and "
"social dialogue within Member States is regarded as reflecting a "
"balance of power between labour and capital, exercised traditionally "
"through industrial conflict. The Treaty does not address even the "
"possibility of industrial conflict at EU level. Indeed, Article 153 "
"(5) TFEU seems explicitly to exclude regulatory competences on the "
"right to strike, which would be most relevant.</p> <p>The present "
"prospect of the EU social dialogue implies rather a tripartite "
"process: involving the social partners and the Commission/Community as "
"a dynamic factor. An important role is played here by the procedure "
"provided in Article 154 (2)ΓΆβ‚¬β€(4) TFEU, which links "
"Commission initiative for potential legislative action to the "
"possibility for adopting regulatory action by European collective "
"agreements. In the absence of industrial conflict at EU level, the "
"consultation of the social partners as part of the legislative process "
"has important consequences for the dynamics of the European social "
"dialogue. It creates a dynamic of ΓΆβ‚¬Λbargaining in the "
"shadow of the law.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>The prospects of and "
"incentives for negotiation and agreement depend on the social policy "
"standard espoused by the Commission in its legislative proposals. "
"Given the lack at the European level of the classic industrial weapons "
"of strikes or lockouts to break any deadlock in bargaining, the "
"stimulus provided by the Commission is very important. This imposes a "
"heavy burden of responsibility on the Commission to promote the "
"process of European social dialogue.</p> <p>Since its creation in the "
"Social Agreement, the social dialogue procedure (Articles 154-155 "
"TFEU) has produced seven agreements at intersectoral level. Three have "
"been transformed into directives relating to <a "

"concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP.</li> </ul> <p>The European social "
"dialogue via Article 154-155 TFEU may also result in autonomous "
"agreements. An autonomous agreement is an agreement signed by the "
"European social partners. Although not incorporated into a directive, "
"it creates a contractual obligation for the affiliated organisations "
"of the signatory parties to implement the agreement at each "
"appropriate level of the national system of industrial relations:</p> "
"<ul> <li>The fourth is the <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/dsw/public/actRetrieveText.do?id=10418\\>European "
"Framework Agreement on Telework</a> signed on 16 July 2002. It was the "

"partners in the Member States</li> <li>The fifth is the <a "

"Framework Agreement on inclusive labour markets</a> concluded by ETUC, "
"BusinessEurope, UEAPME and CEEP on 25 March 2010.</li> </ul> <p>The "
"intersectoral European social dialogue may also result in a failure to "
"reach agreement. In the case of the <a "
"href=\\socialdialogue.htm\\>social dialogue</a> on European works "
"councils, the failure to reach an agreement among the social partners "
"resulted in a directive at the initiative of the Commission. "
"Similarly, in the case of the failure of social dialogue on <a "
"href=\\temporaryagencywork.htm\\>temporary agency work</a>, the "
"directive was finally enacted by the normal legislative route on 5 "
"December 2008.</p> <p>The European social dialogue procedure has also "
"produced results at sectoral level. The most striking development of "
"European sectoral social dialogue agreements emerged in a number of "
"transport sectors as a result of negotiations following their initial "
"exclusion from the Working Time Directive. In <a "

"2000/34/EC</a> of 22 June 2000), Article 1(3) initially excluded most "
"transport sectors from the scope of the directive. The intention was "
"never that this should be a permanent exclusion, but that these "
"sectors should reach <a href=\\socialdialogue.htm\\>social "
"dialogue</a> agreements at EU level adopting working time arrangements "
"tailored to their exigencies. For example, this was accomplished by an "

"2000/79/EC</a>.</p> <p>In the rail sector, a sectoral social dialogue "
"agreement was reached also on 30 September 1998. However, its "
"translation into a directive was delayed because the EU social "
"partners in the rail sector were unwilling to proceed unless and until "
"a similar arrangement was made in the road transport sector. They "
"feared competition, should lower standards in road transport give that "
"sector an unfair competitive advantage. However, EU social dialogue in "
"the road transport sector remained deadlocked, mainly over the issue "
"of whether it should cover self-employed drivers. The deadlock was "

"<br /> <p>One of four EU structural funds, the European Social Fund "
"(ESF) is governed by Article 162 TFEU and its origins date back to the "
"beginning of the European Community. The 1951 <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/treatyofparis.htm\\>Treaty "
"of Paris</a> which established the European Coal and Steel Community "
"(ECSC) envisaged cash aids to workers whose firms were closed or "
"restructured in order to maintain the income of such workers at a "
"reasonable level and assist them to retrain and find new jobs, if "
"necessary, in different areas and thereby soften the impact of the "
"massive restructuring of the steel industry. This is often cited as "
"the promotion of economic social cohesion. The EC Treaty copied and "
"extended the activities of the ECSC in this area by the creation of a "
"social fund to compensate certain groups of people for the "
"difficulties caused by the economic changes resulting from the "
"creation of a common market. Between 1960 and 1973, more than 1.5 "
"million workers were helped in this way.</p> <p>The ESF began "
"activities in its new form on 1 May 1972, increasing the types of "
"activities funded and, instead of simply refunding Member States for "
"their own efforts, supporting policies identified as priorities at "
"Community level. There was a massive increase in its budget in the "
"early 1980s: the 1983 Social Fund budget represented a 42.4% increase "
"on 1981 and a 270% increase on 1978. In the period 2000-2006, the ESF "
"had 70 billion EUR at its disposal, accounting for 36% of the total EU "
"structural funds The regulations of 1999 cover the period 2000-2006 "
"and focus on three main <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.eu.int/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/TREATYOFPARIS.htm\\>Objectives</a>: "
"1) the development and structural adjustment of regions lagging "
"behind, 2) the economic and social conversion of areas faced by "
"structural problems and 3) support for the adaptation and "
"modernisation of education, training and employment policies in "
"regions not covered by Objective 1.</p> <p>A main aim of the ESF "
"concerns advancing the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeanemploymentstrategy.htm\\>European "
"Employment Strategy</a> (EES). To this end, Article 2 of the ESF "
"Regulation (1262/1999) outlines five key policy areas:</p> <ul> <li>to "
"develop policies to combat unemployment;</li> <li>to promote social "
"inclusion and equality;</li> <li>to develop education and "
"training;</li> <li>to promote a skilled, highly trained and adaptable "
"workforce;</li> <li>to improve womenΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs access to the "
"labour market.</li> <li>In July 2006, a new ESF programme for the "
"period 2007-2013 was adopted by the Parliament and Council. The "
"regulations relating to the ESF focus now on two objectives: "
"convergence and regional competitiveness and employment. The "
"Commission contends that this new regulation differs from the "
"2000-2006 situation in that it is more focused, concentrating "
"particularly on supporting the management and anticipation of economic "
"and social change. As a means of fulfilling its two objectives, "
"attention is paid to the following four areas.</li> <li>increasing "
"adaptability of workers and enterprises;</li> <li>enhancing access to "
"employment and participation in the labour market;</li> "
"<li>reinforcing social inclusion by combating discrimination and "
"facilitating access to the labour market by disadvantaged people;</li> "
"<li>promoting partnerships for reform in the fields of employment and "
"inclusion.</li> </ul> <p>As in the past, these new regulations "
"underline the importance of involving the social partners and "
"stakeholders in the drafting, implementation, monitoring and revising "
"ESF strategy.</p> <p>As of 1 January 2007, Objective 3 (adaptation and "
"modernisation of education) will cease to be covered by the ESF. This "
"new legal base allows the Commission to use the ESF to be more active "
"in the area of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/gendermainstreaming.htm\\>gender "
"mainstreaming</a>. Discrimination represents a major concern of the "
"ESF. Since 2001, the ESF has financed the <a "

"<p>In its strategy ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEurope 2020ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, "

"Employment Strategy</a> encourages measures to meet three headline "
"targets by 2020:</p> <p>75% of people aged 20-64 in work; school "
"drop-out rates below 10% at least 40% of "
"30-34ΓΆβ‚¬β€year-olds completing third level education; at "

"Agenda for new skills and jobs</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά are essential to "
"meet these targets.</p> <p>The European social model is considered to "
"be unique in its dual focus on economic and social principles. For "
"example, in a Communication on ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEmployment and social "
"policies: A framework for investing in qualityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52001DC0313:EN:HTML\\>COM "
"(2001) 313</a>), the Commission contrasts the ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEuropean "
"social modelΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of public social spending with the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛUS modelΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, which relies on private "
"expenditure, highlighting the fact that 40% of the US population lacks "
"access to primary health care, although per capita expenditure as a "
"proportion of GDP is higher in the US than in Europe. The Commission "
"goes on to emphasise that it is not only the existence of jobs but "
"also the characteristics of employment that are important to the "
"European social model. The EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs commitment to "
"inclusion is reiterated in the <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52010DC0758:EN:NOT\\>European "
"Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion</a>, which forms part of "
"the Europe 2020 Strategy, stating that combating social exclusion, "
"promoting social justice and fundamental rights have long been core "
"objectives of the European Union, which is founded on the values of "
"respect for human dignity and solidarity.</p> <p>The European "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=6566&amp;langId=en\\>Industrial "
"Relations in 2010 Report</a> highlights the fact that industrial "
"relations at European, national, cross-industry, sectoral and company "
"level, is crucial to the success and stability of the European social "
"model. It also states that one of the key challenges for the European "
"social at present is the search for the right balance between, on the "
"one hand, efficiency and, on the other hand, equity and solidarity "
".</p> <p>A further defining feature of the European social model, when "
"contrasted with that of the US, is the important role attributed to "
"organisations of workers (<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/tradeunions.htm\\>trade "
"unions</a>) and employers in Europe. Although a <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/studies/tn0804058s/tn0804058s_1.htm\\>report</a> "
"from Eurofound in 2008 points to a steady decline in union membership "
"across the European Union, it shows that the weighted average union "
"density in EU Member States remains comparatively high, at just under "
"24%, according to figures contained in the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Industrial Relations in Europe 2010 "
"report, which states that over the past few years, earlier trends "
"towards declining union density, decentralisation of collective "
"bargaining and greater employee participation have continued, and the "
"company level has become more prominent in terms of bargaining.</p> "
"<p>This contrasts with trade union density of 12% in the US and of "
"18,2% in Japan, according to the Eurofound 2008 report. The US figure "
"is lower than any EU country with the exception of France.</p> <p>The "
"European social model is also characterised by a high coverage rate of "
"collective agreements. The CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Industrial "
"Relations in Europe 2010 Report notes that voluntary collective "
"bargaining plays a key role in industrial relations and is a defining "
"element in social partnership within and beyond the EU.Although, "
"according to the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs report, there are large "
"differences in the role, coverage and effectiveness of collective "
"bargaining around the EU.</p> <p>Overall, according to the report, an "
"estimated 121.5 million of the 184 million employees in employment in "
"the EU were covered by a collective agreement in 2008, which "
"translates into an adjusted bargaining coverage rate of 66 %, or "
"two-thirds of all EU employees. Over the past decade, the number of "
"employees covered increased by more than eight million, but since "
"employment increased much faster, the coverage has rate slipped by two "
"percentage points. There are wide variations in coverage rates, "
"however, ranging from virtually 100 % in Austria to less than 20 % in "
"Lithuania.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>ΓΆβ‚¬ΛSocial partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is a term "
"generally used in Europe to refer to representatives of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/managementandlabour.htm\\>management "
"and labour</a> (employersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά organisations and trade "
"unions). The term ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEuropean social "
"partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά specifically refers to those organisations "
"at EU level which are engaged in the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeansocialdialogue.htm\\>European "
"social dialogue</a>, as provided for under Article 154 and 155 of the "
"<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:EN:PDF\\>Treaty "
"on the functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU). Primary Union law "
"for the first time refers to the notion of ΓΆβ‚¬Λsocial "
"partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in Article152 TFEU:</p> "
"<p>ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe Union recognises and promotes the role of the "
"social partners at its level, taking into account the diversity of "
"national systems. It shall facilitate dialogue between the social "
"partners, respecting their autonomy.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>The "
"identification of organisations to be included in the category of "
"European social partner raises potential difficulties. Although the "
"current TFEU Treaty never uses the word ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/representativeness.htm\\>representativeness</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, "
"the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeancommission.htm\\>European "
"Commission</a> has clearly been drawn to this criterion for "
"identifying the relevant organisations of management and labour. The "
"question of the representativeness of the social partner organisations "
"at European level is fundamental as it constitutes the basis of their "
"right to be consulted by the Commission under the article 154 of the "
"Treaty.</p> <p>In its ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a "
"href=\\http://aei.pitt.edu/5194/01/001653_1.pdf\\>Communication "
"concerning the application of the Agreement on Social "
"Policy</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (COM (93) 600 final, Brussels, 14 "
"December 1993), the Commission set out criteria for the "
"representativeness of organisations and these are still valid today. "
"According to the Commission, organisations should:</p> <ul> <li>be "
"cross-industry or relate to specific sectors or categories and be "
"organised at European level;</li> <li>consist of organisations, which "
"are themselves an integral and recognised part of Member State social "
"partner structures and with the capacity to negotiate agreements, and "
"which are representative of all Member states, as far as "
"possible;</li> <li>have adequate structures to ensure their effective "
"participation in the consultation process.</li> </ul> <p>The "
"Commission regularly publishes a ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=522&amp;langId=en\\>list "
"of European social partner organisations</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά which, "
"in the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs view, comply with these criteria "
"and, therefore, are consulted by the Commission under Article 154 of "
"the TFEU treaty. At present, according to the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 2010 <a "
"href=\\ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=6008&amp;langId=en\\>report</a> "
"on the European sectoral social dialogue, the list includes 86 "
"organisations (of which 79 are sectoral organisations) and is divided "

"Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions</a> is "

"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/representativeness.htm\\>sectoral "

"are either engaged in <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/social_dialogue/sectoral_en.htm\\>sectoral "
"social dialogue</a> or in <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/social_dialogue/interprof_en.htm\\>cross-industry "
"social dialogue</a>. In these cases, representativeness is not based "
"on the criteria mentioned, but in the ΓΆβ‚¬Ε“mutual "
"recognitionΓΆβ‚¬Β between the social partners on their "
"capacity to engage in collective bargaining.</p> <h3>Prerogatives of "
"the European social partners</h3> <p>At present, the prerogatives of "
"the European social partners within the policy processes at European "
"level are defined by Article 154 and 155 TFEU. Basically, the "
"competences of the social partners in the social policy field are "
"defined quite extensively, as follows:</p> <ul> <li>social partners "
"are procedurally involved in the genesis of any Commission initiative "
"in the social policy field (Art. 154.2 and 154.3 TFEU), both in the "
"direction and the content of a proposal;</li> <li>they may decide on "
"how they wish to implement their agreements ΓΆβ‚¬β€ "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λeither in accordance with the procedures and practices "
"specific to management and labour and the Member States or, in matters "
"covered by Article 153, at the joint request of the signatory parties, "
"by a Council decision on a proposal from the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Art. 155.2 TFEU);</li> <li>they may "
"decide on autonomous agreements in all social policy fields "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ even those not falling under the competences of EU "
"institutions as defined in Art 154 EC (Art. 155.1 EC).</li> </ul> "
"<p>In practice, the European social partners have not used their "
"rights very extensively. This is mainly due to the difficulties in "
"reconciling different interests when it comes to formulating joint "
"agreements. However, there are some cases of successful agreements (on "

"This has been willingly picked up by the social partners "
"themselves.</p> <p>In its Communication of 26 June 2002, the "
"Commission called on the European social partners to develop their "
"autonomous dialogue further and to establish joint work programmes. In "
"their second joint multi-annual work programme, the European social "

"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/lisbonstrategy.htm\\>Lisbon "
"Strategy</a>, sharpening the focus of European social dialogue and "
"enhancing their autonomy. They highlighted the main achievements of "
"the first programme: the framework agreements on telework and "
"work-related stress, the framework of actions for the lifelong "
"development of competencies and qualifications, and action on gender "
"equality.</p> <p>The second <a "

"programme (2006ΓΆβ‚¬β€2008)</a> aimed to further develop "

"agreements and frameworks of actions and to ΓΆβ‚¬Λfurther "
"develop their common understanding of these instruments and how they "
"impact at the various levels of social dialogueΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. "
"They also negotiated a ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a "

"<br /> <p>European Works Councils (EWCs) are standing bodies providing "
"for the <a href=\\informationandconsultation.htm\\>information and "
"consultation</a> of employees in <a "
"href=\\communityscaleundertakings.htm\\>Community-scale "
"undertakings</a> and Community-scale groups of undertakings as "
"required by the 1994 European Works Council Directive (<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31994L0045:EN:HTML\\>Directive94/45/EC</a>, "
"now updated by the recast Directive<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0038:EN:NOT\\>2009/38/EC</a>). "
"EWCs are highly significant in terms of European industrial relations "
"since they represent the first genuinely European institution of "
"interest representation at enterprise level. They reflect a growing "
"recognition of the need to respond to the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEuropeanisationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of business emerging "
"from the <a href=\\singleeuropeanmarket.htm\\>Single European "
"Market</a> by supplementing existing national channels of information "
"and consultation, a goal which was expressed in the Social Charter of "
"1989 and the accompanying<a href=\\socialactionprogramme.htm\\>Social "
"Action Programme</a>.</p> <p>The thresholds required for an enterprise "
"to be covered by the Directive are, for a Community-scale undertaking, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λat least 1,000 employees within the Member States and "
"at least 150 employees in each of at least two Member "
"StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 2(1)(a)). It is left to Member "
"States to decide on the mechanism for determining the selection of "
"employee representatives, ΓΆβ‚¬Λin accordance with the "
"principle of subsidiarityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Essentially, the "
"aim of the Directive is to promote voluntary agreements on the "
"constitution and operation of EWCs. This operated in two ways. First, "
"the original 1994 Directive allowed multinational companies (MNCs) and "
"groups covered by the Directive to reach voluntary agreements with "
"employee representatives on the establishment of EWCs before the "
"Directive actually came into force on 22 September 1996. These "
"so-called ΓΆβ‚¬ΛArticle 13 agreementsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά were "
"exempt from the provisions specified in the Directive, for the "
"lifespan of the agreement, as long as they covered the entire "
"workforce of the group within the scope of the Directive.</p> "
"<p>Second, since 22 September 1996, negotiations to establish EWCs "
"have been governed by the procedures under Article 6 of the Directive, "
"which requires the formation of a <a "
"href=\\specialnegotiatingbody.htm\\>special negotiating body</a> "
"(SNB). Crucially, it is up to the undertakingΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"central management and the SNB to agree on the precise form and "
"function of their EWC. This includes, for example, the signatory "
"parties; coverage, composition, numbers and seat allocation; the terms "
"of office; functions and procedure; venue, frequency and duration of "
"meetings; financial and material resources; duration of the agreement "
"and the procedure for its renegotiation; issues for information and "
"consultation; experts; confidentiality; select committee operations; "
"employee-side pre-meetings; rules on deputies to employee "
"representatives; languages policy and interpretation provided; "
"procedure for agreeing the agenda; procedure for drawing up minutes or "
"other records; and communication to employees generally. Only if there "
"is a failure to agree between the parties, or if they so choose, is "
"the ΓΆβ‚¬Λfall back positionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά triggered of "
"the provisions detailed in the Annex to the Directive.</p> "
"<h3>Revision of the Directive</h3> <p>A mechanism for revision was "
"included under Article 15 of the 1994 Directive. In April 2004, the "
"Commission began consultations with the EU-level social partner bodies "
"on measures to enhance the effectiveness of EWCs, including a possible "
"revision of the Directive. At the time, the positions of the social "
"partners on this matter were divided: the European Trade Union "
"Confederation (<a href=\\etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>) was pressing the "
"Commission for numerous revisions, while <a "
"href=\\businesseurope.htm\\>BusinessEurope</a> (previously known as "
"the Union of Industrial and EmployersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Confederations "
"of Europe, UNICE) contested the case for overhauling the Directive.In "
"April 2005, the EU-level employer and trade union bodies "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ UNICE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€published a joint text, <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/IMG/pdf/7c-EWCs_lessons_learned_010305-EN.pdf\\>Lessons "
"learned on European Works Councils (142 Kb PDF)</a>, which assessed "
"the operation of EWCs and highlighted lessons for the future. Overall, "
"the joint text reported the positive role that EWCs can play in "
"improving the information flow between workers and management, "
"allowing for consultation of workers on relevant cross-border issues "
"affecting the group, developing a corporate culture in transnational "
"groups and gaining acceptance for necessary change.</p> <p>In July "
"2005, ETUC and BusinessEurope responded formally to the European "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs April 2005 Communication on "
"restructuring and employment<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2005:0120:FIN:EN:PDF\\>(COM(2005) "
"120 final (263 Kb PDF))</a>. The Communication outlines measures aimed "
"at improving the EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs capacity for anticipating and "
"managing restructuring. The Communication was also intended to "
"initiate the second phase of consultation on the revision of the EWC "
"Directive. However, the reaction of the social partners was generally "
"critical. While the ETUC executive committee criticised the Commission "
"for launching a joint consultation on two separate issues: company "
"restructuring and the Directive on EWCs, BusinessEurope affirmed its "
"opposition to the beginning of a second-phase consultation on the "
"revision of the EWCs Directive.</p> <p>The European Commission "
"declared the revision of the EWC Directive to be one of its "
"legislative priorities for 2008. In February of that year, a "
"Commission document formally launched the second-phase consultation. "
"This time, the employer side agreed to negotiate about a revision. "
"ETUC, however, rejected negotiations on the grounds that they feared "
"that these could not be finished early enough to complete the revision "
"process before the next European elections. On 2 July 2008, the "
"Commission publishedthe proposal for a recast Directive. By choosing "
"the instrument of a recast instead of a complete revision, the "
"Commission aimed to finalise negotiations with the European Parliament "
"and the Council of Ministers during the French EU presidency in the "
"second half of 2008.</p> <p>The main objectives of the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs proposal were to enhance the "
"effectiveness of EWCs (particularly by improving the definition of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛinformationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛconsultationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά), to resolve legal "
"uncertainties and problems (e.g. in cases of restructuring) and to "
"harmonise the EWC Directive with more recent Directives on employee "
"representation.</p> <p>In August 2008, the European social partners "
"indicated that they accepted the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"proposal as a basis for a recast of the 1994 EWC Directive and "
"proposed a number of changes to this proposal. Based on this common "
"position of the social partners, the political institutions reached an "
"informal agreement on the recast Directive in a meeting on 4 December "
"2008. On 16 December 2008, the European Parliament adopted the "
"compromise text.</p> <p>The new, recast Directivestrengthens the role "
"and rights of EWCs in a number of areas. Notably, it:</p> <ul> "
"<li>reinforces and more clearly defines the information and "
"consultation rights of EWCs;</li> <li>links and more clearly "
"differentiates the information and consultation of EWCs and of "
"national bodies, providing a new definition of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λtransnational mattersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά covered by "
"EWCs;</li> <li>gives a greater role to <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/TRADEUNIONS.htm\\>trade "
"unions</a>;</li> <li>entitles EWC members to training without loss of "
"pay; and</li> <li>contains rules on adapting EWCs to structural change "
"in the multinational concerned.</li> </ul> <p>On 6 June 2011, the 30 "
"EEA member states were due to implement the recast Directive.According "
"to <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=707&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=211#Implementation\\>data</a> "
"from the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/EUROPEANCOMMISSION.htm\\>European "
"Commission</a>, as at 12 January 2012, 26 EU and EEA countries had "
"implemented the Directive, the majority by legislative means. The "
"Commission did not have any information from Greece, Luxembourg, "
"Iceland or Liechtenstein.</p> <p>After the original Directive took "
"effect in 1996, around 70 new EWCs were set up each year from 1997 to "
"2001 and the rate declined to around 30 a year during most of the "
"2000s. However, after the recast Directive was adopted in May 2009, "
"the conclusion of new EWC agreements declined to very low levels (only "
"15 were signed in 2010).</p> <p>The slowdown in activity in setting up "
"EWCs in the two years between the adoption and the implementation of "
"the recast Directive may reflect, at least in part, legal uncertainty "
"over the status of agreements signed in this period. It also stems "
"from a desire on the part of unions and employee representatives to "
"await implementation so that they could benefit from the recast "
"DirectiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs more advantageous provisions.</p> <p>Now "
"that the new Directive has taken effect, an upswing in the conclusion "
"of new agreements may be anticipated.</p> <p>According to figures from "
"the European Trade Union Institute (<a "
"href=\\http://www.etui.org\\>ETUI</a>) around 2,400 multinationals are "
"potentially covered by the EWCs Directive. The latest data from the "
"ETUI database show that, as at 2012, a total of 1,214 EWCs had been "
"created. However, it should be noted that some multinational companies "
"have installed EWCs at a division level. Therefore, the total number "
"of EWCs is larger than the number of MNCs that have a EWC. Currently, "
"931 multinational companies have an active EWC. However, not all "
"eligible MNCs have established EWCs. This is due to the fact that the "
"introduction of EWCs is not automatic but requires either the "
"initiative of central management or ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe written request "
"of at least 100 employees or their representatives in at least two "
"undertakings or establishments in at least two different Member "
"StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 5(1)).</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>A fitness check is defined by the European Commission as a "
"comprehensive policy evaluation assessing whether the regulatory "
"framework for a policy sector is fit for purpose. Its aim is to "
"identify excessive administrative burdens, overlaps, gaps, "
"inconsistencies and/or obsolete measures which may have appeared over "
"time, and to help to identify the cumulative impact of the "
"legislation. The findings of fitness checks will serve as a basis for "
"drawing policy conclusions on the future of the relevant regulatory "
"framework. Fitness checks will not replace more traditional "
"evaluations of individual instruments ΓΆβ‚¬β€ these two "
"instruments are meant to be mutually reinforcing, with fitness checks "
"providing a more strategic and global view.</p> <p>Pilot fitness check "
"initiatives began in four policy areas in 2010, of which employment "
"and social policy was one. The other policy areas are environment, "
"transport, and industrial policy. In the employment and social policy "
"area, the focus of the fitness check currently rests on the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/informationandconsultation.htm\\>information "
"and consultation of workers</a> . The Commission notes that "
"legislation in this area dates back to the 1970s and led in 2002 to "
"the adoption of a general, permanent and statutory system of "
"information and consultation at EU level, in the form of <a "

"2002/14/EC</a> establishing a general framework for informing and "
"consulting employees in the European Community.</p> <p>The Commission "
"states that given the importance of information and consultation, "
"further increased by the number of company closures and restructurings "
"prompted by the financial and economic crisis, a fitness check of the "
"current regulatory framework in the area of information and "
"consultation is necessary. It will help identify gaps and overlaps in "
"order to ensure that the regulation is effective, without unnecessary "
"administrative burdens and up to date. It will build upon an extensive "

"<br /> <p>In Council <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0070:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"1999/70/EC</a> of 28 June 1999 concerning the Framework Agreement on "
"fixed-term work concluded by <a href=\\etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>, <a "
"href=\\unice.htm\\>UNICE</a> and <a href=\\ceep.htm\\>CEEP</a>, the "
"definition of ΓΆβ‚¬Λfixed-term workerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λa person having a <a "
"href=\\contractofemployment.htm\\>contract of employment</a> or "
"relationship entered into directly between an employer and a worker, "
"where the end of the employment contract or relationship is determined "
"by objective conditions such as reaching a specific date, completing a "
"specific task, or the occurrence of a specific eventΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"(Clause 3(1)).</p> <p>Fixed-term employment has increased continually "
"during the past 20 years in the EU. In 1983, 8.1% of the labour force "
"was employed on a fixed-term contract whereas the figure for 2005 was "
"14.5%. Women are in most countries more likely than men to work on the "
"basis of a fixed-term contract (on average, the female fixed-term "
"employment rate is15%, while the male fixed-term employment rate is "
"14%). Gender differences are more evident in Malta, Cyprus and "
"Finland. Between 2000 and 2006 the share of fixed-term employment "
"increased by 2.4% on a EU25 average. However, the proportion of the "
"workforce engaged on a fixed-term contract varies greatly among Member "
"States generally depending on the employment protection legislation in "
"force for regular contracts. Over this period of time, the fixed-term "
"employment increased strongly in Luxembourg, Italy, Cyprus, the "
"Netherlands, Sweden, Slovenia and Poland. There are still significant "
"gaps in fixed-term employment rates among EU25, with rates ranging "
"from below 5% (Estonia, Malta, Ireland, Lithuania and Slovakia) to "
"more than 15% (in the Netherlands, Sweden, Slovenia, Finland, "
"Portugal, Poland). In Spain, the rate is higher than 30%. The trend "
"towards a greater use of non-permanent employment is particularly "
"evident in the expanding service sector. On overage, people with low "
"or medium educational levels are more likely to hold a fixed-term "
"contract. Along with segmentation by education, the Eurostat data "
"(2006) show a segmentation by age: in EU25, the fixed-term employment "
"rate of workers between the ages of 15-24 is 42%.</p> <h3>Framework "
"Agreement</h3> <p>The Framework Agreement on fixed-term work concluded "
"by the European social partners on 18 March 1999 led to a second "
"directive specifically concerned with fixed-term work (<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0070:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 1999/70/EC</a> of 28 June 1999 concerning the Framework "
"Agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP). The "
"first was <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0383:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 91/383</a>/EC of 25 June 1991 supplementing the measures to "
"encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers with a "
"fixed-duration employment relationship or a temporary employment "
"relationship.</p> <p>The stated aims of the fixed-term work directive "
"are to improve the quality of fixed-term work by ensuring the "
"application of the principle of non-discrimination, and establish a "
"framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive "
"fixed-term employment contracts or relationships.</p> <p>The "
"fixed-term work agreement underlines ΓΆβ‚¬Λachieving a better "
"balance between flexibility in working time and security for "
"workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Flexibility is to be balanced with security "
"for workers. Clause 5 of the Agreement is entitled: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛMeasures to prevent abuseΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, and "
"obliges Member States and/or the social partners ΓΆβ‚¬Λwhere "
"there are no equivalent legal measures to prevent "
"abuseΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, to take measures to prevent abuse. In "
"particular, the General Considerations highlight: ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe "
"use of fixed-term employment contracts based on objective reasons is a "
"way to prevent abuse.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά The implication is that the "
"use of fixed-term work not based on objective reasons may be an abuse. "
"Fixed-term contracts require justification. Hence the aim of the "
"framework agreement is to place limits on successive recourse to "
"fixed-term employment contracts. Their use, solely on the basis that "
"Member State legislation provides for them, is not consistent with the "
"framework agreementΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs objective of conferring "
"protection. Those employed on two or more successive fixed-term "
"contracts, for a period of four years or more, are deemed to be "
"permanent employees, unless the employer can objectively justify the "
"continued use of the fixed-term contract by the presence of specific "
"factors relating to the particular activity in question and the "
"conditions under which it is carried out.</p> <p>Member State "
"legislation may not introduce a requirement for the framework "
"agreement only to apply where successive contracts are separated by a "
"very short period of time, if the consequences are to compromise the "
"framework agreementΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs objectives or its practical "
"effects (<a "

"Adeneler and others v Ellinikos Organismos Galaktos Case "
"C-212/04</a>). The directive applies equally to public sector bodies "
"as to the private sector; however, it may permit the preclusion of "
"successive contracts being converted into indeterminate contracts in "
"cases of public sector employment where there is another effective "
"measure to prevent or punish such abuse (<a "

"<br /> <p>Flexibility is a term frequently used in the context of EU "
"employment and industrial relations but its meaning is contested. This "
"is because it includes three dimensions.</p> <ol> <li>It can refer to "
"employersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά desire for variable (flexible) labour "
"inputs, in terms of numbers employed or hours worked, to match changes "
"in demand for products or services. It can also refer to changing the "
"tasks and skills of employees to increase productivity. The first type "
"is sometimes described as ΓΆβ‚¬ΛexternalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛquantitativeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά or "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛnumericalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά flexibility; the second as "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛinternalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β„ΆqualitativeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά; or "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛfunctionalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά flexibility.</li> <li>It "
"can also refer to employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά desire for variable "
"(flexible) contractual arrangements and working conditions to match "
"changing private and domestic needs. Flexibility may concern different "
"forms of contractual arrangement (including ΓΆβ‚¬Λatypical "
"workΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά), particularly as regards working time, to suit "
"better <a href=\\worklifebalance.htm\\>work-life balance</a>.</li> "
"<li>Flexibility is also often presented in the EU context as a policy "
"response to ΓΆβ‚¬Λlabour market rigiditiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, "
"which some economists regard as contributing to unemployment. "
"Strategies on employment have been influenced by studies, such as that "
"of the OECD Jobs Study in 1994, which favourably compare the US labour "
"market with the ΓΆβ‚¬ΛrigiditiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of those "
"of the EU Member States. However, policies of deregulation aimed at "
"increasing flexibility (e.g. easier hiring and firing of labour) may "
"be seen as threatening employment security and quality of work. For "
"example, when the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Social Policy Agenda "
"2000-2005 (COM (2000) 379 final, Brussels, 28 June 2000) refers to "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛflexibilityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, it consistently refers "

"<br /> <p>Flexicurity is such a new concept in the academic and policy "

"Commission (<a href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/\\>EC</a>), in its 2007 "
"communication <a "
"href=\\http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fsocial%2FBlobServlet%3FdocId%3D2756%26langId%3Den&amp;ei=DQ7kUOvBDK2W0QWrw4CgBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQJ9Sl2z-SCtYDhhS77GC7sfH2ag&amp;sig2=Pg1R3I9Vgh43toTs2s8LGA&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.d2k\\> "
"Towards Common Principles of Flexicurity (1016Kb PDF)</a>, said "
"flexicurity could be defined as an integrated strategy to enhance, at "
"the same time, flexibility and security in the labour market.</p> "
"<p>In 2004 Ton Wilthagen and Frank Tros published their seminal work "
"on the idea, <a "
"href=\\http://trs.sagepub.com/content/10/2/166.abstract\\>The concept "
"of ΓΆβ‚¬ΛflexicurityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά: A new approach to "
"regulating employment and labour markets</a>, in Transfer: European "
"Review of Labour and Research. In the article they defined flexicurity "
"as:</p> <p><i>...(1) a degree of job, employment, income and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛcombinationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά security that facilitates "
"the labour market careers and biographies of workers with a relatively "
"weak position and allows for enduring and high quality labour market "
"participation and social inclusion, while at the same time providing "
"(2) a degree of numerical (both external and internal), functional and "
"wage flexibility that allows for labour marketsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (and "
"individual companiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά) timely and adequate adjustment "
"to changing conditions in order to enhance competitiveness and "
"productivity.</i></p> <p>The flexicurity model, first implemented in "
"Denmark in the 1990s, is a combination of easy hiring and firing "
"providing flexibility for employers, and high benefits for the "
"unemployed providing security for the employees. This must be combined "
"with training to increase job mobility. Perceived as a new way of "
"viewing flexibility, flexicurity aims to provide employees and "
"companies with the ability to better adapt to insecurities associated "
"with global markets.</p> <p>The European Commission <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm\\>(EC)</a> has been promoting "
"the concept of flexicurity for a number of years. In its 1997 Green "
"Paper, <a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu/documents/comm/green_papers/pdf/com97_128_en.pdf\\>Partnership "
"for a new organization of work (2.8Mb PDF)</a>, it stressed the "
"importance of both flexibility and security for competitiveness and "
"the modernisation of work organisation. The idea also featured "
"prominently in the ΓΆβ‚¬Λadaptability "
"pillarΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of the EU <a "
"href=\\employmentguidelines.htm\\>employment guidelines</a>, where "
"social partners were invited to:</p> <p><i>...negotiate at all "
"appropriate levels agreements to modernise the organisation of work, "
"including flexible working arrangements, with the aim of making "
"undertakings productive and competitive and achieving the required "
"balance between flexibility and security.</i></p> <p>The need for "
"security of employment to balance flexibility in the labour market is "
"also reflected in <a href=\\europeansocialdialogue.htm\\>European "
"social dialogue</a>. For example, the <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997L0081:EN:HTML\\>Framework "
"Agreement on part-time work</a>, concluded 6 June 1997, and the <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0070:EN:HTML\\>Framework "
"Agreement on fixed-term work</a>, concluded on 18 March 1999, both "
"refer to ΓΆβ‚¬Λflexibility in/of working time and security "
"for workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Employment security is a "
"particular concern in relation to <a "
"href=\\fixedtermwork.htm\\>fixed-term work</a>. In the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Explanatory Memorandum to the proposed "
"draft directive implementing the Agreement, the Commission emphasised "
"that:</p> <p><i>ΓΆβ‚¬Β¦the social partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"contribution is positive in itself in that it guarantees that "
"consideration is given both to business competitiveness and to the "
"interests of workers.</i></p> <p>In recent years there have been "
"different interpretations of the term flexicurity. The European Trade "
"Union Confederation (<a href=\\etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>) in particular "
"rejected the claim that job security needed to be replaced by "
"employment security. However, recent developments suggest that social "
"partners, along with the Commission, were moving towards an "
"interpretation which was acceptable to all parties.</p> <p>The key "
"breakthrough came towards the end of 2007, when the European "
"Parliament endorsed a resolution called the <a "
"href=\\http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/file.jsp?id=5531922\\>Common "
"Principles of Flexicurity</a> on 29 November. The "
"ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs position was a response to the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 2007 communication, Towards Common "
"Principles of Flexicurity. In December 2007, the Council adopted eight "
"common principles of flexicurity:</p> <ol> <li>Flexicurity is designed "
"to implement the main principles of the Lisbon Strategy;</li> "
"<li>Flexicurity, in addition to being committed to life-long learning, "
"active labour market policies and a modern social welfare system, sees "
"the need for flexible contractual arrangements;</li> <li>Flexicurity "
"needs to adapt to the different circumstances in each Member "
"State;</li> <li>Flexicurity needs to support open and inclusive labour "
"markets which help to reintroduce inactive employees back into "
"employment;</li> <li>Flexicurity needs to involve the smooth "
"transition between jobs by constantly up-grading "
"employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά skills and providing the necessary social "
"protection in transition periods;</li> <li>Flexicurity should promote "
"both gender equality as well as considering means to reconcile "
"work-life balance issues;</li> <li>Flexicurity needs the support of "
"the social partners;</li> <li>Flexicurity needs to involve a "
"cost-effective distribution of resources which public budgets can "
"sustain.</li> </ol> <p>In February 2008, the Commission underlined its "
"commitment to flexicurity by announcing the setting up of a <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=89&amp;langId=en&amp;newsId=88&amp;furtherNews=yes\\>Mission "

"        requires a much more active approach to health and safety and "
"far more changes to broaden the scope of Member States\\' national "
"legislation. As an\\n"
"        example, it has been an innovation to many Member States that "
"requirements must be followed to protect workers in the public sector. "
"New working\\n"

"and the introduction of\\n"
"        new technology.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Four central features characterise the Framework <a "

"        "
"\\http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=en&amp;numdoc=31989L0391&amp;model=guichett\\>Directive</a> "
"on\\n"
"        health and safety. First, the scope of EC law on health and "
"safety is not constrained by the traditional concept of accidents and "
"disease at work.\\n"
"        Rather, it is characterised by an overall view of the <a "
"href=\\workingenvironment.htm\\>working environment</a>. The framework "
"directive expressly\\n"
"        refers to ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe safety and health of workers in "
"every aspect related to the workΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 5(11)). It "
"covers not only physical risks, but risks of\\n"
"        stress and well-being arising from work organisation and job "
"content.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Second, EC law on health and safety rarely imposes general "
"detailed standards, but leaves space for the taking into account of "
"diversity and\\n"
"        specific conditions. The instrument of the directive defines "
"the objectives but leaves it up to the Member States to decide on the "
"means to achieve\\n"
"        these objectives. Moreover, it often leaves a role for "
"collective bargaining and collective agreements to ensure that the "
"formulation of health and\\n"
"        safety standards is adapted to particular conditions, as "
"exemplified by the Working Time directive. Rather than imposing "
"general and/or more or less\\n"
"        specific and detailed standards regarding the organisation of "
"working time compatible with health and safety, the Working Time "
"directive systematically\\n"
"        delegates to the social partners, the workers and managements "
"concerned the task of elaborating the relevant standards.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The third feature is the strategy of the directive. The "
"approach of EC law to health and safety at work may be characterised "
"as preventative through\\n"
"        the specific and innovative mechanism of <a "
"href=\\riskassessment.htm\\>risk assessment</a>.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Finally, the fourth feature involves EC "
"lawΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs insistence on the intensive participation of "
"workers in the implementation and enforcement of the law\\n"
"        through safety representatives.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Taken together, these characteristic features of the EC law "
"on health and safety, as they must be implemented in national laws, "

"Directive 2004/38/EC</a> of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of "
"the European Union and their family members to move and reside freely "
"within the territory of the EU brings together the complex body of "
"legislation that existed in this area. It eliminates the need for EU "
"citizens to obtain a residence card, introduces a permanent right of "
"residence, defines more clearly the situation of family members and "
"restricts the scope for the authorities to refuse or terminate "
"residence of EU citizens who come from another Member State. The "
"Member States have two years, until 30 April 2006, to transpose this "
"directive.</p> <p>Free movement of people has existed since the "
"foundation of the European Economic Community in 1957. It was "
"introduced from an economic point of view, since the right was linked "
"to a person\\'s status as a salaried worker. The right was then "
"extended to self-employed persons and service providers. Family "
"members were entitled to the same rights. In effect, free movement of "
"people was part of the broader project of realising a common market "
"with free movement of capital, goods and services.</p> <p>The <a "
"href=\\treatyofmaastricht.htm\\>Treaty of Maastricht</a> of 1992 "
"introduced the concept of citizenship of the European Union which "
"confers on every Union citizen a fundamental and personal right to "
"move and reside freely without reference to an economic activity. The "
"<a href=\\treatyofamsterdam.htm\\>Treaty of Amsterdam</a>, which came "
"into force in 1999, further strengthened the rights linked to European "
"Union citizenship.</p> <p>EU citizens have the right to enter, reside "
"and remain in the territory of any other Member State for a period of "
"up to three months simply by presenting a valid passport or national "
"identity card: no other formality is required. If they intend to "
"remain for a period exceeding three months, a residence permit must be "
"obtained. The conditions for granting a residence permit depend on the "
"status of the citizen (employed or self-employed person, student, "
"retired or inactive person).</p> <p>Any EU citizen can take up an "
"economic activity in another Member State either as an employed or "
"self-employed person. In this case, he/she will be issued a residence "
"permit by simply presenting an identity document (passport or ID) and "
"proof of employment or self-employment. If a citizen wants to reside "
"in another Member State without exercising any activity or to study, "
"he/she can do so provided he/she can prove (and in the case of "
"students, declare) that he/she has sufficient financial resources not "
"to become a burden for the host Member State\\'s social assistance "
"system and that he/she is covered by a sickness insurance policy. "
"He/she must also prove that he/she has sufficient financial resources "
"and sickness insurance for each member of his/her family who is "
"entitled to reside with him/her.</p> <p>Family members, irrespective "
"of their nationality, have the right to accompany and establish "
"themselves with an EU citizen who is residing in the territory of "
"another Member State. Family members who can enjoy rights under "
"Community law include the spouse, minor (under 21) or dependent "
"children, and dependent ascendants, though in the case of students "
"only the spouse and dependent children enjoy this right. If the family "
"members are not EU citizens, they may be required to hold an entry "
"visa by the Member State where they intend to accompany the EU "
"citizen. They shall be granted this visa free of charge and with all "
"facilities by that Member State.</p> <p>Article 45 TFEU includes a "
"guarantee of <a href=\\freemovementofworkers.htm\\>free movement of "
"workers</a>, and that this ΓΆβ‚¬Λshall entail the abolition "
"of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the "
"Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions "

"whether the reference to ΓΆβ‚¬Λworkers of the Member "
"StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά covered only EU nationals or also non-EU "
"nationals resident and working within the Community, so that the same "
"principle applied to all workers in the Community, regardless of their "
"nationality. However, Council Regulation 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on "
"freedom of movement for workers within the Community specifically "
"restricts its application to workers who are nationals of the Member "
"States, and the European Court of Justice has interpreted the "
"provision as applying only to EU nationals. Consequently, the status "
"of third-country nationals who reside and work within the Community is "
"different from that of EU nationals, even if Council Regulation "

"<br /> <p>Free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms "
"guaranteed by Community law. It is perhaps the most important right "
"under Community law for individuals, and an essential element of "
"European citizenship.</p> <p>For workers, this freedom has existed "
"since the foundation of the European Community in 1957. It is laid "
"down in Article 45 TFEU and it entails:</p> <ul> <li>the right to look "
"for a job in another Member State;</li> <li>the right to work in "
"another Member State;</li> <li>the right to reside there for that "
"purpose;</li> <li>the right to remain there;</li> <li>the right to <a "
"href=\\equal%0Atreatment.htm\\>equal treatment</a> in respect of "
"access to employment, working conditions and all other advantages "
"which could help to facilitate the worker\\'s integration in the host "
"Member State.</li> </ul> <p>The concept and implications of this "
"freedom have been interpreted and developed by the case law of the <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a>, "
"including the concept of <a href=\\worker.htm\\>worker</a> itself.</p> "
"<p>The emphasis on free movement of workers since the beginning of the "
"European Economic Community distinguished labour regulation in the "
"Community from national labour laws of the Member States, where free "
"movement was not of concern, as well as from international labour "
"standards. Labour standards focused on employment protection and "
"industrial relations were not a primary concern of an EC aiming at "
"free movement of workers, certainly in the earlier stages of the "
"Community, but even later in the EU. The primary objective of "
"establishing free movement of workers in a labour market was for long "
"the dominant feature of EU regulation of employment and industrial "
"relations.</p> <p>The provisions of Article 45 TFEU are further "
"developed in Council Regulation 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom "
"of movement for workers within the Community (as amended up to "
"Regulation 2434/92) and <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31968L0360:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 68/360/EEC</a> of 15 October 1969 on the abolition of "
"restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for "
"workers of Member States and their families. Further provisions "
"include Regulation (EEC) No. 1251/70 of the Commission of 29 June 1970 "
"on a <a "
"href=\\worker%E2%80%99srighttoremain.htm\\>workerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"right to remain</a> in the territory of a Member State, after having "
"been employed in that State.</p> <p>These provisions entitle any EU "
"national to take up and engage in gainful employment on the territory "
"of another Member State, to equal treatment to national workers as "
"regards working and employment conditions, social and tax benefits; "
"his or her family members are also entitled to establish themselves, "
"together with the worker, whatever their nationality. Nevertheless, "
"employment in the public services is excluded from this provision "
"(Article 45(4) TFEU), and there are permissible limitations when "
"justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public "
"health (Article 45(3) TFEU).</p> <p><a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1976:039:0002:0002:EN:PDF\\>Council "
"Regulation (EEC) No. 312/76</a> of 9 February 1976 amending the "
"provisions relating to the trade union rights of workers contained in "
"Regulation (EEC) No. 1612/68 on freedom of movement for workers within "
"the Community provides that a national of one Member State working in "
"another is entitled to equal treatment with the nationals of the host "
"state with respect to the exercise of trade union rights, including "
"the right to vote and to be eligible for the administration or "
"management posts of a trade union. A non-national may be excluded from "
"the management of bodies under public law and from the exercise of an "
"office under public law. However, he or she has the right of "
"eligibility for workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representative bodies within "
"the undertaking.</p> <p>States seeking membership of the EU have often "
"had specific provisions in the Accession Treaty subjecting free "
"movement to conditions. Following enlargement of the EU to 25 members "
"by the accession of 10 countries on 1 May 2004, there were "
"transitional periods that limited the free movement of workers from "
"these Member States, except Malta and Cyprus. Until 2006, the access "
"to the labour markets of the 15 former Member States exclusively "
"depended on national policies. After mid-2006, these 15 Member States "
"had to notify the Commission whether they would continue with national "
"restrictions or allow free movement of workers. After 2009, any of "
"these 15 Member State had to ask the Commission for authorisation to "
"continue to apply national measures for a further two years "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ but only if it was experiencing serious "
"disturbances in its labour market. This requirement had to be "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λobjectively justified.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά From 2011, "
"complete freedom of movement for workers from the Member States which "
"joined in May 2004 is guaranteed. Similar transitional periods were "
"agreed with regard to the 2007 enlargement by Bulgaria and "
"Romania.</p> <p>Although free movement is an economic, not a social "
"concept, it creates many problems of a social nature: transfer of "
"pensions and social benefits, entitlements of migrant workers to "
"unemployment, <a href=\\socialsecurity.htm\\>social security</a> and "
"other benefits, family issues of education, housing, and so on. These "
"social issues came to be dealt with not as independent social "
"concerns, but under the rubric of economic free movement of labour. "
"This created a tension in the balance between the economic and the "
"social perceptions of free movement of workers. Policy initiatives, "
"legislative provisions and court decisions were concerned with "
"economic and not social consequences ΓΆβ‚¬β€ that is, with "
"possible restraints on free movement and not with the social "
"implications of free movement of workers.</p> <p>However, the overlap "
"of EU economic and social policy in the area of free movement has been "
"the source of major developments in EU social policy with potentially "
"far-reaching implications. For example, the definition of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛworkerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά by the European Court under "
"the Treaty provisions dealing with free movement developed "
"independently of national legal definitions (<i>Hoekstra (nΓƒΒ©e "
"Unger) v. Bestuur</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61963J0075:EN:HTML\\>Case "
"75/63</a>, (1964) ECR 177) and has asserted its claim to override "
"national legal definitions (<i>Levin v. Secretary of State for "
"Justice</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61981J0053:EN:NOT\\>Case "
"53/81</a> (1981) ECR 1035). This had important implications for the "
"general regulation of employment and industrial relations in the EU, "
"not only in the regulation of free movement.</p> <p>Overall, the "
"principle of free movement of workers as a founding principle of the "
"common market had an initially dominant influence on the perception of "
"the nature of labour regulation in the European Union. In contrast, "
"there is the much later; and potentially critical, emergence of a "
"right to free movement of persons, as citizens of the EU (Article 21 "
"TFEU). Eliminating the need for an economic justification for the "
"right to free movement based on work, this shift to free movement of "
"citizens has wider consequences for the initiatives and actions of EU "
"institutions active in the field of free movement.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>Freedom of assembly and association is recognised under the "
"Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Worker of 1989, "
"which defines the context of ΓΆβ‚¬ΛFreedom of association and "
"collective bargainingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά as one where:</p> "
"<p><i>Employers and workers of the European Community shall have the "
"right of association, in order to constitute professional "
"organisations or trade unions of their choice for the defence of their "
"economic and social interests.</i></p> <p>The principle of freedom of "
"association under <a href=\\eulaw.htm\\>EU law</a> is contained in <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/equ_opp/treaty_en.html#136\\>Article "
"151</a>TFEU, which sets out the social policy objectives of the "
"Community, ΓΆβ‚¬Λhaving in mind fundamental social rights "
"such as those set out in the European Social Charter signed at Turin "
"on 18 October 1961 and in the 1989 Community Charter of the "
"Fundamental Social Rights of WorkersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Thus the "
"Community Charter of 1989 is a reference point for both the Community "
"and the Member States.</p> <p>The issue of whether there are limits to "
"the exercise of the right to freedom of association has been "
"considered by the European Court of Human Rights, which has ruled on "
"the scope of the right to freedom of association. The court had to "
"determine whether the right to associate freely implies that there is "
"a corresponding obligation to accept all those who wish to associate "
"and has held this not to be the case. In the case of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2007/05/articles/eu0705029i.html\\>ASLEF "
"v UK Case C-1002/05</a> the court ruled that, in the same way as "
"individuals have the right to join or not to join trade unions, so, "
"too, do trade unions have the right to accept or reject applicants for "
"membership. Thus, the right to freedom of association recognises that "
"there are constraints on the exercise of the right.</p> <p>The "
"principals of freedom of association are also recognised under Article "
"12 of the <a "
"href=\\charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter of "
"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> which establishes "
"that:</p> <p><i>Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly "
"and to freedom of association at all levels, in particular in "
"political, trade union and civic matters, which implies the right of "
"everyone to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his or "
"her interests.</i></p> <p>The Charter was unanimously adopted by the "
"EU institutions at the Nice summit of December 2000.With the entry "
"into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009 "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe Union recognises the rights, freedoms and "
"principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the "
"European Union of 7 December 2000, as adapted at Strasbourg, on 12 "
"December 2007, which shall have the same legal value as the "
"TreatiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 6 TEU). Article 12, which must be "
"interpreted consistently with the 1989 Community Charter, refers to "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λfreedom of association at all levelsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. "
"This does not explicitly specify the EU or transnational level, and "
"could therefore be interpreted as applying only to all levels within "
"Member States. On the other hand, however, the reference in the "
"Preamble to the EU Charter to the Council of EuropeΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"Social Charter (ECHR) would appear to indicate the opposite "
"conclusion: that the Article protects freedom of association also at "
"EU level. Article 5 of the European Social Charter refers to "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe freedom of workers and employers to form local, "
"national or international organisationsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The EU "
"CharterΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs reference in the Preamble to international "
"treaties also supports this conclusion: ILO Convention 87 concerning "
"freedom of association refers in Article 5 to the right "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λto affiliate with international organisations of "
"workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Article 12 is in Chapter II of the "
"Charter, entitled ΓΆβ‚¬ΛFreedomsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, not in "
"Chapter IV, entitled ΓΆβ‚¬ΛSolidarityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, "
"where most trade union and labour rights are found. The article makes "
"two references to trade unions ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the only references "
"to trade unions in the Charter ΓΆβ‚¬β€ and raises the "
"prospect of mutual influences regarding freedom of association in the "
"EU. Firstly, <a "
"href=\\internationallabourstandards.htm\\>international labour "
"standards</a>, national constitutions and other national legal "
"measures could be used to interpret ambiguities in Article 12 as it "
"applies in the EU. Secondly, the emerging interpretation of the "
"Article in the EU could influence the right of association as it has "
"been applied in the Member States, and also at international "
"level.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>Fundamental rights are now part of the EU legal order. "
"However, the original Treaties did not contain provisions relating to "
"basic human rights. The European Economic Community was limited to "
"economic matters, and the <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"first developed protection for fundamental rights in economic and "
"commercial interests, rights to property and the freedom to pursue a "
"trade or profession.</p> <p>Moreover, the Court was impelled to "
"include fundamental rights in the EU legal order so as to defend the "
"principle of supremacy of EU law. The threat to the supremacy of EU "
"law over national law arose when national constitutional courts "
"resisted Community action, insofar as they considered it as violating "
"fundamental rights protected in national constitutions.</p> <p>In "
"<i>Stauder v. City of Ulm</i>, <a "

"Case 29/69</a>, [1969] ECR 419, a Commission decision was said to be "
"contrary to basic rights under German constitutional law. The ECJ "
"managed to interpret the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs action to avoid "
"this conflict, but added: (paragraph 7) ΓΆβ‚¬ΛInterpreted in "
"this way, the provision at issue contains nothing capable of "
"prejudicing the fundamental human rights enshrined in the general "
"principles of Community law and protected by the "
"Court.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>On the one hand, the European Court "
"emphasises that fundamental rights as general principles of Community "
"law are autonomous from specific principles protected by the "
"constitutional laws of individual Member States. On the other hand, "
"these fundamental rights as general principles of EU law are rooted in "
"the national legal cultures and reflect the constitutional traditions "
"of the Member States.</p> <p>The latest development in the integration "
"of fundamental rights in the EU legal order has been the incorporation "
"of the <a "
"href=\\charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter of "
"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>, initially proclaimed at "
"the European Council at Nice on 7 December 2000, into primary EU law "
"by the <a href=\\treatyoflisbon.htm\\>Treaty of Lisbon</a> which took "
"effect on 1 December 2009.</p> <h3>Fundamental labour rights</h3> "
"<p>As regards fundamental rights in the field of employment and "
"industrial relations, the Preamble to the <a "
"href=\\treatyoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Treaty of the European Union</a> "
"confirms the Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά ΓΆβ‚¬Λattachment "
"to fundamental social rights as defined in the European Social Charter "
"signed at Turin on 18 October 1961 and in the 1989 Community Charter "
"of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Article "
"151 of the ΓΆβ‚¬ΛSocial ChapterΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of the TFEU "
"begins: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe Union and the Member States, having in mind "
"fundamental social rights such as those set out in the European Social "
"Charter signed at Turin on 18 October 1961 and in the 1989 Community "
"Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, shall have as "
"their objectives the promotion of employment, improved living and "
"working conditions, so as to make possible their harmonisation while "
"the improvement is being maintained, proper social protection, "
"dialogue between management and labour, the development of human "
"resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of "
"exclusion.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά These references have been considered by "
"some Authors as an incorporation of the fundamental rights in the "
"Treaties.</p> <p>The <a "
"href=\\charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter of "
"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> includes seven chapters "
"divided into 54 Articles covering fundamental rights relating to "
"dignity, liberty, equality, solidarity, citizenship and justice. Of "
"particular interest to employment and industrial relations are "
"provisions on protection of personal data (Article 8), freedom of "
"association (Article 12), freedom to choose an occupation and right to "
"engage in work (Article 15), non-discrimination (Article 21), equality "
"between women and men (Article 23), workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά right to "
"information and consultation within the undertaking (Article 27), "
"right of collective bargaining and collective action (Article 28), "
"protection in the event of unjustified dismissal (Article 30), fair "
"and just working conditions (Article 31), prohibition of <a "
"href=\\childlabour.htm\\>child labour</a> and protection of young "
"people at work (Article 32) and reconciliation of family and "
"professional life (Article 33).</p> <p>The provisions of these "
"Charters provide sources of inspiration for all the EU institutions, "
"and in particular, the European Court of Justice in litigation "
"concerned with social and labour rights. Moreover, the relevance of "
"the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union might be "
"further increased by its incorporation in the Treaty establishing a "
"Constitution for Europe, though its approval is still pending.</p> "
"<p>Fundamental rights in the field of employment and industrial "
"relations are not identical in the EU Member States. The historical, "
"legal and industrial relations traditions of the former EU15, for "
"instance, have produced differences in national laws, which highlight "
"the problem of producing a set of uniform fundamental rights. However, "
"despite national differences, analysis of fundamental rights in the "
"Member States can identify a comprehensive list of rights, which the "
"European Court of Justice might be prepared to recognise as common to "
"all or just some Member States.</p> <p>Further, the European Court of "
"Justice would be able to draw upon a range of international law "
"sources of fundamental rights in the labour field. The Council of "
"EuropeΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Social Charter is referred to in the "
"Treaties. Ratification by all Member States of ILO Conventions, for "
"example, Convention No. 87 of 1948 (Freedom of Association and "
"Protection of the Right to Organise), and Convention No. 98 of 1949 "
"(Application of the Principles of the Right to Organise and to Bargain "
"Collectively) has produced a common foundation of fundamental rights "

"<br /> <p>Gender mainstreaming is a globally accepted strategy for "
"promoting gender equality. Mainstreaming is not an end in itself but a "
"strategy, an approach, a means to achieve the goal of gender equality. "
"Mainstreaming involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention "

"development, research, dialogue, legislation, resource allocation, and "
"planning, implementation and monitoring of programmes and "
"projects.</p> <p>The CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Fourth Equalities "

"policies and activitiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά emphasised the need to take "
"systematic account of gender differences in the context of all "
"policies including, but not restricted to, employment and the labour "
"market. For example, a Council Resolution of 2 December 1996 provided "
"for mainstreaming equal opportunities for women and men into the "

"<br /> <p>Eurostat, the statistical office of the European "
"Communities, uses the following definition of the gender pay gap: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe gender pay gap is given as the difference between "
"average gross hourly earnings of male paid employees and of female "
"paid employees as a percentage of average gross hourly earnings of "
"male paid employees. The gender pay gap is based on several data "
"sources, including the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), the "
"EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) and national "
"sources. The target population consists of all paid employees aged "
"16-64 that are at work 15+ hours per weekΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> "
"<p>The unadjusted gender pay gap is the figure obtained before "
"adjusting for observed characteristics, such as individual "
"characteristics such as age, education, the number of children, job "
"tenure and occupation, as well as workplace characteristics such as "
"the economic sector and place of employment or the existence of a "
"collective agreement. While singling out the contribution of all of "
"these factors in explaining the gender pay gap, the remaining part is "
"interpreted as being ΓΆβ‚¬ΛdiscriminatoryΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"in nature.</p> <p>The unadjusted gender pay gap is considered to be an "
"important indicator in monitoring the inequality in pay between men "
"and women in Europe. The most recent Eurostat figures for the "
"unadjusted gender pay gap, which are provisional and relate to 2009, "
"put it at 17.1% on average in the EU27, slightly less than the 17.6% "
"recorded for 2008. There are wide variations in the gender pay gap "
"between EU Member States, ranging from 2% in Malta to over 25% in "
"Estonia, Austria and the Czech Republic (2008 figures "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ 2007 for Estonia).</p> <p>The reasons for the "
"existence and size of the gender pay gap are varied and may differ "
"considerably from one Member State to another; they include the kind "
"of jobs held by women, the effects of career breaks or part-time "
"working due to childbearing, a tendency to work in lower paid "
"industries and sectors with less negotiating power, and decisions in "
"favour of family life. A <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2010/18/en/2/EF1018EN.pdf\\>study "
"on the gender pay gap</a> carried out by Eurofound in 2010 notes that "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe list of factors used to explain the gender pay gap "
"is long and relationships among them complexΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. This "
"study also notes that over the past few decades, researchers have "
"adopted relatively standardised methods for assessing the gender pay "
"gap. Overall, studies have found that despite a significant decline in "
"the level of the unadjusted pay gap, the unexplained or "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛdiscriminatoryΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά component of the gap "
"has remained largely the same.</p> <p>The 2010 Eurofound study mapped "
"studies on the adjusted gender pay gap around the EU (a figure that is "
"adjusted to take into account observed differences, such as levels of "
"education and labour market experience, as well as job and company "
"characteristics, that might explain the gap), finding that this ranges "
"from 4% in Denmark to 30% in Cyprus. However, the study also notes "
"that adjusting for observed differences only might be misleading when "
"trying to explain the gender pay gap and addressing the level of "
"discrimination. Both horizontal and vertical segregation "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ or the fact that women tend to choose lower paid "
"professions, reach glass ceilings within their professions, or see "
"their jobs being valued less ΓΆβ‚¬β€ which are very often "
"found to be the major reasons for a gap.</p> <p>The gender pay gap has "
"been a policy concern at European Union level for some time. In 2003, "
"the European Commission stated that one of the objectives of the "
"European Employment Strategy was ΓΆβ‚¬Λto achieve by 2010 a "
"substantial reduction in the gender pay gap in each Member State, "
"through a multi-faceted approach addressing the underlying factors of "
"the gender pay gap, including sectoral and occupational segregation, "
"education and training, job classifications and pay systems, awareness "
"raising and transparencyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Further, in 2006, the "
"Commission published a <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2006:0092:FIN:EN:HTML\\>Roadmap "
"for equality between women and men</a> 2006ΓΆβ‚¬β€2010, "
"which set as a priority the elimination of the gender pay gap, "
"followed in 2007 by a Communication on <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2007:0424:FIN:EN:HTML\\>Tackling "
"the pay gap between women and men</a>, which discusses a number of "
"ways to address the gender pay gap, including legislation, employment "
"policies, encouraging employers to respect equal pay and the exchange "
"of good practices at EU level.</p> <p>These were followed in 2008 by a "
"European Parliament <a "
"href=\\http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2008-0544+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN\\>resolution</a>, "
"which made recommendations to the Commission on the application of the "

"Declaration of 19 December 1991 on the implementation of the "

"<br /> <p>Harmonisation appears in the context of EU employment and "
"industrial relations as an EU objective, originally stipulated in "
"Article 117 of the EEC Treaty of 1957, now in Article 151TFEU:</p> "
"<p>ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe Union and the Member States, (ΓΆβ‚¬Β¦) "
"shall have as their objectives the promotion of employment, improved "
"living and working conditions, so as to make possible their "
"harmonisation while the improvement is being maintained, proper social "
"protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of "
"human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the "
"combating of exclusion.</p> <p>To this end the Union and the Member "
"States shall implement measures which take account of the diverse "
"forms of national practices, in particular in the field of contractual "
"relations, and the need tomaintain the competitiveness of the Union "
"economy.</p> <p>They believe that such a development will ensue not "
"only from the functioning of the internal market,which will favour the "
"harmonisation of social systems, but also from the procedures provided "
"for in the Treaties and from the approximation of provisions laid down "
"by law, regulation or administrative action.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> "
"<p>.</p> <p>This provision reflects the ambivalence of harmonisation "
"in EU social policy. Harmonisation is put forward as an objective to "
"be made possible. However, it appears that harmonisation is to ensue "
"as the passive result of the functioning of the common market, which "
"favours harmonisation. The active use of procedures in the Treaty and "
"approximation of laws is less clearly to be the instrument of "
"harmonisation. In other words, as originally envisaged, harmonisation "
"is a market process, not a legal process.</p> <p>This reflects another "
"ambivalence inherent in the concept of harmonisation: whether "
"harmonisation of laws or harmonisation of substantive conditions is at "
"issue. The harmonisation of laws does not necessarily imply the "
"harmonisation of substantive conditions. Put differently, if "
"harmonisation of conditions is aimed at, then different laws may be "
"required. This is the result of a combination of two factors.</p> "
"<p>First, where similar labour laws are invoked, their effects on "
"different industrial relations systems give rise to variable results. "
"This is mirrored in the formal successes of harmonisation policy (e.g. "
"the same directives applied in all Member States), but in the variable "
"consequences in practice of this formal success.</p> <p>Secondly, "
"different industrial relations systems mean that the national labour "
"laws invoked to deal with the problem are different. National labour "
"laws are different precisely because of the differences in national "
"industrial relations systems, and indeed, in different commercial and "
"other environments.</p> <p>The problems for harmonisation policy arise "
"from differing industrial relations contexts, and differing formal "
"labour laws. Formal harmonisation of laws may lead to differences in "
"practice in different national environments; substantive harmonisation "
"in the practice of Member States may require different laws to be "
"adopted, which can accommodate the different national environments. "
"This has been the major obstacle at which progress towards "
"harmonisation as a legal policy of the Unionhas been halted.</p> "
"<p>Harmonisation was the social policy strategy adopted by the EU in "
"the first Social Action Programme (SAP) of 1974; more than 30 measures "
"were adopted over an initial period of three to four years. However, "
"as the EEC Treaty of 1957 did not provide the necessary legal "
"competences to intervene in the social field, social policy had to be "
"justified as necessary to promote the common market. "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛHarmonisationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of social policy was "
"based on Article 94 EC (now Article 115 TFEU), which provided for "
"approximation of laws that directly affect the establishment or "
"functioning of the common market. Social policy harmonisation was "
"deemed necessary to ensure a level playing field of fair competition "
"in the common market.</p> <p>Only when the EU gained competences in "
"the field of employment and industrial relations, first in the <a "
"href=\\singleeuropeanact.htm\\>Single European Act</a> 1986 and then "
"the <a href=\\treatyofmaastricht.htm\\>Treaty of Maastricht</a> 1992, "
"could Community social initiatives be adopted without the need to "
"justify them in terms of harmonisation of laws directly affecting the "
"common market. Article 118a EEC, introduced by the SEA, allowed for EU "
"directives aiming at the harmonisation of conditions in the area of "
"health and safety of workers.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) and "
"the World Health Organization (WHO), health and safety at work is "
"aimed at the promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of "
"physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations; "
"the prevention among workers of leaving work due to health problems "
"caused by their working conditions; the protection of workers in their "
"employment from risks resulting from factors adverse to health; the "
"placing and maintenance of the worker in an occupational environment "
"adapted to his or her physiological and psychological capabilities; "
"and, to summarise, the adaptation of work to the person and of each "
"person to their job.</p> <p>Health and safety is given a wide "
"definition in the Union context, going beyond the avoidance of "
"accidents and prevention of disease to include all aspects of the "
"workerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs well-being. The competence of the EU to "
"intervene in the field of health and safety at work is defined by the "
"provision in Article 153(1 and 2) TFEU, which authorises the Council "
"to adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements as regards "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λimprovement in particular of the working environment to "
"protect workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά health and safetyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"(a provision originating in the Single European Act 1986). The "
"significance of this broad scope of ΓΆβ‚¬Λhealth and "
"safetyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is immense, as it underpins the potential of "
"EU health and safety policy to prescribe minimum standards to protect "
"all aspects of the workerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs well-being.</p> <p>The "
"adoption of the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/singleeuropeanact.htm\\>Single "
"European Act</a> in 1986 gave new impetus to the occupational health "
"and safety measures taken by the Community. It represented the first "
"time that health and safety at work had been dealt with in an "
"operational provision in the EEC Treaty, under the new Article 118A "
"EEC. This article allowed the Council of Ministers to adopt directives "
"intended to protect workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά health and safety at "
"work by qualified majority, thus speeding up the adoption process at "
"the Council. Of significant importance to the level of protection in "
"Member States is that directives adopted under Article 118A (now <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E137:EN:HTML\\>Article "
"153(2) TFEU</a>) lay down minimum requirements concerning health and "
"safety at work. According to this principle, the Member States must "
"raise their level of protection if it is lower than the minimum "
"requirements set by the directives. Beyond this, the provisions "
"adopted shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or "
"introducing more stringent measures for the protection of working "
"conditions.</p> <p>On the other hand, Article 100A EEC (now <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E095:EN:HTML\\>Article "
"114</a> TFEU) ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the objective of which was to remove "
"all barriers to trade in the single market and to allow the free "
"movement of goods across borders ΓΆβ‚¬β€ is also relevant "
"for health and safety at work, as directives under Article 100A EEC "
"are intended to ensure the placing on the market of safe products, "
"including machinery and personal protective equipment. The area of "
"health and safety at work has been one of intense activity on the part "
"of the EU and it is estimated that approximately two-thirds of all "
"social policy directives are in this field. The pattern of activity "
"has been characterised by unevenness, however, with periods of more or "
"less activity and changes in EU strategy in this area. The period "
"following the adoption of the Single European Act was particularly "
"fruitful, producing, most importantly, the general <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/frameworkdirectiveonhealthandsafety.htm\\>Framework "
"Directive on health and safety</a> (<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31989L0391:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 89/391/EEC</a> of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of "
"measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers "
"at work). This was soon followed by a further six "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛdaughterΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά directives, which came into "
"effect by 1 January 1993. Since then, Union law has produced a number "
"of further directives covering conditions in the workplace, "
"requirements as to work equipment and exposure to <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/dangeroussubstances.htm\\>dangerous "
"substances</a> (chemical, physical and biological agents). The "
"principal and general measure concerned with health and safety at the "
"workplace is <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31989L0654:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 89/654/EEC</a> on the minimum health and safety requirements "
"for the workplace. It is the first individual directive within the "
"meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC. Beyond this, there "
"are further directives concerned with specific workplaces or "
"industries.</p> <p>However, changing social priorities in the 1990s, "
"reflected in an emphasis on competitiveness and employment, changed "
"the context of the EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs agenda on health and safety, "
"leading to less legislative output and a turn towards more <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/softlaw.htm\\>soft "
"law</a> measures. In recent years, the emphasis has been on "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λinnovative approachesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, such as "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛpartnershipsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛbenchmarkingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <h3>Enforcement and "
"compliance</h3> <p>Although the Union law on health and safety applies "
"equally to all Member States and is guaranteed supremacy over national "
"law, the implementation and enforcement of that law inevitably "
"reflects the different national traditions of enforcement, with "
"consequences for the consistency of its application across the EU. "
"Since the beginning of the 1990s, Community documents setting out the "
"features of Community occupational health and safety policy have "
"argued that poor implementation and enforcement of Union law on health "
"and safety have become a core concern of Community policy in this "
"field. The argument has been used to prioritise some attempts (not "
"always successful) to implement the existing <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/acquiscommunautaire.htm\\>acquis "
"communautaire</a> in the field rather than the adoption of new "
"regulations.</p> <p>In this context, the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeanagencyforsafetyandhealthatwork.htm\\>European "
"Agency for Safety and Health at Work</a> was established in 1994, and "
"the Commission has made increasing use of its control powers to incite "
"Member States to better implementation. The <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/seniorlabourinspectorscommittee.htm\\>Senior "
"Labour InspectorsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Committee</a> (SLIC) was "
"established in 1995 to ΓΆβ‚¬Λgive its opinion to the "
"Commission, either at the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs request or on "
"its own initiative, on all problems relating to the enforcement by the "
"Member States of Community law on health and safety at "
"workΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>However, there are important limits on "
"the initiatives of the Commission and the Agency to ensure better "
"implementation, and ultimately it is the responsibility of the Member "
"States, each with its own administrative and industrial relations "
"traditions, to ensure the enforcement of EU law on health and "
"safety.</p> <p>Failure by Member States to comply with the EU law on "
"health and safety allows for the Commission to complain of such "
"violations to the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European "
"Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) under Article 258 TFEU. However, this "
"success in achieving compliance as regards transposition of directives "
"does not imply that the EU law is being respected in practice in the "
"Member States. The Commission does not have the resources to enable it "
"to adequately monitor implementation of EU law on health and safety "
"within the Member States, and the anticipated reports on practical "

"<br /> <p>Horizontal direct effect is a legal doctrine developed by "

"against other private individuals before national courts.</p> <p>By "
"virtue of the doctrine of the ΓΆβ‚¬Λdirect "
"effectΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of Treaty provisions, individuals can rely "
"directly on EU law before their national courts. There is no need for "
"implementation of EU law by Member States through national law. The "
"ECJΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs creation of the doctrine was driven by Member "
"StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά failure to comply with EC law.</p> <p>The "
"initial rationale of ΓΆβ‚¬Λdirect effectΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ to secure the effectiveness "
"(ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<i>effet utileΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</i> in French) of EU "
"law by enabling individuals to rely on EU law against Member States "
"that fail to implement or comply with EU law (<a "
"href=\\verticaldirecteffect.htm\\>vertical direct effect</a>) "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ was then extended to allow individuals to rely on "
"Treaty provisions against other private individuals also: for example, "
"requiring respect for the principle in Article 157 TFEU of equal pay "
"for women and men (<i>Defrenne v. Sabena</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;numdoc=61975J0043&amp;lg=en\\>Case "
"43/75</a>).</p> <p>The initial rationale of ΓΆβ‚¬Λdirect "
"effectΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά was partially changed when the question arose "
"of the direct effect of directives. The Court held that the doctrine "
"of direct effect did apply to directives. However, directives had only "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛverticalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά direct effect; that is, they "
"could be relied on only vis-ΓƒΒ -vis a Member State. Therefore, "
"individuals could only claim the rights conferred by directives "
"against the state or <a href=\\emanationsofthestate.htm\\>emanations "
"of the state</a> . This more limited version of the doctrine prevented "
"individuals claiming rights under the directive as against other "
"private actors (ΓΆβ‚¬ΛhorizontalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά direct "
"effect).</p> <p>However, the state may appear in a number of "
"emanations of public authority. The scope of the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λdifferent emanations of the stateΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"depends on the criteria developed by the European Court to define them "
"(Foster v. British Gas, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=en&amp;numdoc=61989J0188\\>Case "
"C-188/89</a>, [1990] ECR I-3313). Nonetheless, the rule of horizontal "
"direct effect remains that directives do not have direct effect "
"against private individuals. A number of Opinions by Advocates-General "
"have attempted to overturn the limitation in the doctrine of "
"horizontal direct effect, extending the effect of directives to "
"private persons, but without success (<i>Dori v. Recreb srl</i>, <a "

"C-91/92</a>, [1994] ECR I-3325). The European CourtΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"doctrine of <a href=\\indirecteffect.htm\\>indirect effect</a> "
"achieves, partially, the result obtainable through the rule of <a "
"href=\\directeffect.htm\\>direct effect</a>; however, this result is "
"obtainable as far as the national law is not wholly inconsistent with "
"Union law.</p> <p>The impact of the doctrine of horizontal direct "
"effect, when applied to provisions of the Treaties, has been limited "
"in the fields of employment and industrial relations, since relatively "
"few Treaty provisions confer individual rights in those areas. "
"However, the <a "

"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> has been incorporated "
"into primary EU law by the Treaty of Lisbon which came into force on 1 "
"December 2009. The inclusion of fundamental rights concerning "
"employment and industrial relations into primary EU law, as was the "
"case with equal pay for women and men (Article 157 TFEU), could lead "

"<br /> <p>Horizontal segregation in the workplace can be broadly "
"defined as the concentration of men and women in different kinds of "
"jobs. The European Commission (<a "

"on <a "
"href=\\http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fsocial%2FBlobServlet%3FdocId%3D4028%26langId%3Den&amp;ei=LSjMUdKxMKr40gWdpoD4DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqDDnnc_zg94G2icxxcLSp4-c3Fg&amp;sig2=Wp1z_qTk718M44dkYJtKJw&amp;bvm=bv.48340889,d.d2k\\> "
"Gender segregation in the labour market (1.7 MB PDF)</a>, states that "
"horizontal segregation is understood as ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe "
"under-representation or over-representation of a given group in "
"occupations or sectors not ordered by any "
"criterionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>The European Health and Safety "
"Agency (<a "
"href=\\https://osha.europa.eu/en/front-page/view\\>EU-OSHA</a>) states "
"that:</p> <p><i>...horizontal</i> <i>segregation is where the "
"workforce of a specific industry or sector is mostly made up of one "
"particular gender. An example of horizontal segregation can be found "
"in construction, where men make up the majority of the "
"industryΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs workforce, whereas childcare is almost "
"exclusively a female occupation.</i></p> <p>This is different to "
"vertical segregation, where opportunities for career progression "
"within a company or sector for a particular gender are limited.</p> "
"<p>The CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs report found that for the EU as a "
"whole, segregation remains relatively high, at 25.3 % for occupational "
"segregation and 18.3 % for sectoral segregation. However, there are "
"also wide differences among countries, with a gap of about 10 "
"percentage points between the most and the least segregated "
"countries.</p> <p>The countries with the highest levels of gender "
"segregation were found to be Estonia, Slovakia, Latvia and Finland, "
"and the four countries with the lowest levels of gender segregation "
"were Greece, Romania, Malta and Italy.</p> <p>The report highlighted "
"the top six occupations employing the largest numbers of women:</p> "
"<ul> <li>shop salespeople and demonstrators;</li> <li>domestic helpers "
"and related jobs such as cleaners and launderers;</li> <li>personal "
"care and related workers;</li> <li>other office clerks;</li> "
"<li>administrative associate professionals;</li> <li>housekeeping and "
"restaurant services workers.</li> </ul> <p>The top six occupations "
"employing the largest numbers of men are:</p> <ul> <li>motor vehicle "
"drivers;</li> <li>building frame and related trade workers;</li> "
"<li>managers of small enterprises;</li> <li>building finishers and "
"related trades workers;</li> <li>physical and engineering science "
"technicians;</li> <li>machinery mechanics and fitters.</li> </ul> "
"<p>Horizontal segregation in practice means that women are typically "
"over-represented in sectors or occupations that often offer lower "
"rates of pay. They also require skill levels that are rated lower than "
"those required by sectors and occupations in which men are "
"over-represented. This is considered to be a major contributory factor "
"to the <a href=\\genderpaygap.htm\\>gender pay gap</a> in the EU.</p> "
"<p>In its <a "

"for equality between women and men 2010ΓΆβ‚¬β€2015 (55.6 KB "
"PDF)</a>, the European Commission points to occupational segregation "
"as one of the causes of the gender pay gap, as women and men still "
"tend to work in different sectors and jobs.</p> <p><i>On the one hand, "
"women and men are often over-represented in certain sectors, with "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛfemaleΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά jobs (mostly in health care, "
"education and public administration) being in general less valued than "
"typically male professions. On the other hand, within the same sector "
"or company the jobs done by women tend to be of lower value and less "
"well paid.</i></p> <p>Most recently, the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "

"on Progress on equality between women and men in 2012 (567 KB "
"PDF)</a>, released in May 2013 calculates the level of sectoral and "
"occupational segregation as the average national share of employment "
"for women and men applied to each occupation. Differences are added up "
"to produce the total amount of gender imbalance expressed as a "
"proportion of total employment (ISCO classification).</p> <p>On this "
"basis, it finds that gender segregation in occupations in the EU27 was "
"24.5 in 2012, down from 25.1 in 2007. Gender segregation in economic "

"<br /> <p>ΓΆβ‚¬ΛHorizontalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά <a "
"href=\\subsidiarity.htm\\>subsidiarity</a> applies the concept of "
"subsidiarity, originally invoked in the context of exercise of "
"competences as between the different levels of the Member States and "
"the Community (ΓΆβ‚¬ΛverticalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά subsidiarity: "
"Article 5 (3) TEU), to the context of allocation and exercise of "
"competences on the same level as between the EU, the Member States and "
"the social partners. Horizontal subsidiarity addresses the specific "
"question of choices at the same level: whether the allocation and "
"exercise of competences by the EU institutions or by the <a "
"href=\\europeansocialpartners.htm\\>European social partners</a> is "
"preferable; and similarly at Member State level: whether action by the "
"state or the social partners at national level is preferable.</p> "
"<p>In the fields of employment and industrial relations, Articles "
"154-155 TFEU allow for EU level action not only by EU institutions, "
"but also by the European social partners. Also, action at Member State "
"level can be taken by the social partners as well as by Member State "
"government. The result is a choice among possible levels of action: by "
"the European social partners or by the EU institutions, by Member "
"State governments or by the social partners within the Member States, "
"or even by the social partners at either EU or national levels. The "
"problem is how to apply the principle of subsidiarity to determine the "
"choice of level at which action is to be taken.</p> <p>Horizontal "
"subsidiarity is, therefore, a concept used to address the fundamental "
"role of the social partners in the implementation of the social "
"dimension of the EU. In its first Communication concerning the "
"application of the Agreement on Social Policy (COM (93) 600 final, "
"Brussels, 14 December 1993), the Commission acknowledged: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λa dual form of subsidiarity in the social field: on the "
"one hand, subsidiarity regarding regulation at national and Community "
"level; on the other, subsidiarity as regards the choice, at Community "
"level, between the legislative approach and the agreement-based "
"approach.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά This was said to be ΓΆβ‚¬Λin "
"conformity with the fundamental principle of subsidiarity enshrined in "
"[Article 5 EC].ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>However, in its Opinion 94/C "
"397/17, OJ 397/40 of 31.12.94 on the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"Communication of 1993, the Economic and Social Committee (ECSC) "
"emphasised that the criteria specified in Article 5 EC refer to "
"vertical, not horizontal, subsidiarity. The criteria for choosing "
"which set of actors at the same level is appropriate are not "
"necessarily those of Article 5 (3) TEU:</p> <p><i>ΓΆβ‚¬ΛUnder "
"the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do not fall within its "
"exclusive competence, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the "
"objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by "
"the Member States, either at central level or at regional and local "
"level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the "
"proposed action, be better achieved at Union "
"level.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</i></p> <p>In the case of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛhorizontalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά subsidiarity, efficiency "
"(ΓΆβ‚¬Λsufficiently achievedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά) may have to "
"be weighed against other fundamental principles. For example, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛefficiencyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά might dictate EU or Member "
"State action, but long-standing hegemony of the social partners, at "
"one or other levels of bargaining, over certain policy areas may "
"dictate leaving it to management and labour to settle the substance of "
"EC labour policy in that area. An illustration of this principle may "
"be the exclusion of EU directives concerning the right of association "
"and the right to strike in Article 153(5) TFEU. This may reflect a "
"choice that the social partners should retain competence on this issue "
"to make ΓΆβ‚¬Λagreements... at EC level (which) shall be "
"implementedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 155(2) TFEU).</p> "
"<p>Subsidiarity being a relative test as between levels, if, for "
"example, the social partners are unable to adopt measures, this will "
"be a sign that the competence may be exercised at a different level. "
"Similarly, if the EU institutions are unable to adopt measures, the "
"social partners should exercise competence at the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛbetterΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά level.</p> <p>The conclusion "
"may be that the criteria set out in Article 5 (3) TEU do not apply to "
"the concept of horizontal subsidiarity, only vertical subsidiarity. "
"The criteria for the application of horizontal subsidiarity remain to "
"be elaborated. The ECSC Opinion referred to the generally recognised "
"constitutional principle of the autonomy of the social partners (as in "
"ILO Convention No. 98). This should influence any choice as to the "
"responsibilities of the social partners and of the authorities.</p> "

"Directive 2002/14</a> establishing a framework for informing\\n"

"It applies to all undertakings employing at least 50 employees or EU "

"        employing at least 20 employees. The directive is estimated to "
"cover fewer than 3% of all companies, yet these represent about half "

"industrial relations could constitute an infringement of the Article 4 "
"(3) TEU obligation. Similarly, the failure of a Member State to ensure "

"<br /> <p>Insolvency refers to the economic failure of an enterprise "

"to provide a minimum degree of protection for employees in the event "

"employeesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά claims under their contracts of employment "
"against insolvent employers. Member States are required to ensure that "
"institutions can guarantee payment of these claims, though some "
"limitations may be introduced. A Commission Communication of 2002 (COM "

"cases and a number of emerging problems, such as transnational "
"insolvency situations, where it was not clear which guarantee "

"href=\\europeanemploymentstrategy.htm\\>European Employment "
"Strategy</a> (EES) process within the relaunched <a "
"href=\\lisbonstrategy.htm\\>Lisbon Strategy</a>. The aim is to improve "
"coordination between EU Member States and the European institutions "
"and facilitate coordination of employment policies with macroeconomic "
"and microeconomic policies of the EU.</p> <p>The integrated guidelines "
"are presented in one comprehensive document with two parts. Part 1 "
"includes the Commission Recommendations on the Broad Economic Policy "
"Guidelines and provides guidance on macroeconomic and microeconomic "
"policies in the Member States and the Community. Part 2 comprises the "
"proposal for a Council decision on the Employment Guidelines, on which "
"the European Parliament, the European Social and Economic Committee "
"and the Committee of the Regions have to be consulted, in accordance "
"with Article 148 TFEU. In order to ensure proper integration and "
"consistency, cross-references are made between relevant guidelines in "
"parts 1 and 2. The set of guidelines for the period 2005 to 2008 "
"contained a total of 23 guidelines.</p> <p>On 12 July 2005, the <a "
"href=\\counciloftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Council of the European "
"Union</a> adopted the new integrated guidelines (<a "

"L 2005 06/08/05</a>). The comprehensive integrated package of "
"guidelines aims to contribute to refocusing the Lisbon Strategy on "
"growth and employment in which the EES has the leading role in terms "
"of implementation of the employment objectives.</p> <p>In February "
"2005, the European Commission made a proposal for a review of the <a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu/growthandjobs/pdf/COM2005_024_en.pdf\\>Lisbon "
"strategy</a> which led to a complete revision of the EES. This was "
"based on an extensive evaluation of the first five years of the EES "
"carried out in 2002. The evaluation emphasised the need to amend the "
"EES with a view to aligning it more closely to the Lisbon goals. A "
"further revision was launched at the beginning of 2005 as part of the "
"Commission proposal for a refocusing of the Lisbon strategy.</p> "
"<p>From 2005 on, the EES was integrated into the Lisbon governance "
"cycle. Up to this date, the coordination of national employment "
"policies at EU level was exclusively built on the provision of Article "
"128 of the EC Treaty (now 148 TFEU). The integrated guidelines form "
"the basis for the new <a href=\\n"
"ationalreformprogrammes.htm\\>National Reform Programmes</a> (NRP) "
"which replaced the former <a href=\\n"
"ationalactionplans.htm\\>National Action Plans</a>. These NRPs are the "
"outcome of a debate at national level with the competent parliamentary "
"bodies and the social partners, in accordance with national "
"practice.</p> <p>In the EU annual progress report, the Commission "
"reviews progress made at both national and Community level, based on "
"regular monitoring of the actions listed in the Community Lisbon "
"Programme and on an evaluation of the implementation of the Member "
"StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά national programmes. The employment chapter "
"of the annual progress reports is the basis of the Joint Employment "
"Reports. These are adopted in accordance with the procedure of Article "
"148(1) TFEU. The Council may decide, by qualified majority, to issue "
"country-specific <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/employment_strategy/recomm_en.htm\\>recommendations</a> "
"upon a proposal by the Commission.</p> <p>The integrated guidelines "
"are valid for three years, in order to provide the stability required "
"for their implementation. In the intervening years until 2008, "
"updating of the guidelines was to remain strictly limited.</p> <p>On "
"12 December 2006 the European Commission presented the second Annual "

"agreements (TCAs) are ΓΆβ‚¬Λnew instruments for industrial "
"relations that encourage the recognition of social partnership across "
"national borders and yield entirely new forms of social "
"regulationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>They can be subdivided into "
"International Framework Agreements (IFAs) and European Framework "
"Agreements (EFAs).</p> <p>IFAs are signed by Global Union Federations "
"(GUFs) and have a global scope of application. EFAs have a regional "
"(European) scope of application and are signed by <a "
"href=\\http://www.proseworks.co.uk/editors/index.asp\\>European "
"industry federations</a> (EIFs), <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeanworkscouncils.htm\\>European "
"Works Councils</a> (EWCs) and/or national unions and central "
"management.</p> <p>While IFAs are a global instrument with the main "
"purpose of ensuring <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/internationallabourstandards.htm\\>international "
"labour standards</a> are maintained in all of the target "
"companyΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs locations, EFAs are limited to the European "
"context and cover a broader range of topics. In general, EFAs also "
"contain more concrete and focused arrangements.</p> <p>In 1995, the "
"International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (<a "
"href=\\http://www.icftu.org/default.asp?Language=EN\\>ICFTU</a>) and "
"what were then International Trade Secretariats (ITSs) set up a joint "
"working committee. In 1998 the committee proposed a <a "
"href=\\http://www.icftu.org/displaydocument.asp?Index=990917146&amp;Language=EN\\>Code "
"of Labour Practices</a> considered by the ICFTU to be a guide for "
"unions on the rules of conduct of any <a "
"href=\\transnationalenterprise.htm\\>transnational enterprise</a> "
"(TNE). The ICFTU/ITS Code specifies that companies must undertake to "
"respect the fundamental labour rights defined in the 1998 <a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/multi/download/english.pdf\\>ILO "
"Tripartite Declaration</a>. The same obligation has to be imposed on "
"their subcontractors. The ICFTU/ITS Code was used by the ITSs as a "
"reference for negotiating IFAs.</p> <p>In 2002, the ITSs were "
"transformed into GUFs. Several GUFs have their own model framework "
"agreements. The International MetalworkersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"Federation (<a href=\\http://www.imfmetal.org/index.cfm\\>IMF</a>), "
"for example, has the <a "
"href=\\http://www.imfmetal.org/main/files/0505102301487/ifamodel_total_english.pdf\\>IMF "
"Model Framework Agreement (89Kb PDF).</a></p> <p>By 2002, the term "
"International Framework Agreement had been adopted as a means of "
"clearly distinguishing the negotiated agreements from the type of "
"voluntary <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/codesofconduct.htm\\>codes "
"of conduct</a> that corporations were increasingly adopting "
"unilaterally to ostensibly demonstrate their commitment to <a "
"href=\\corporatesocialresponsibility.htm\\>corporate social "
"responsibility</a> (CSR). While codes of conduct represent unilateral "
"initiatives, the negotiation of IFAs could be seen as the start of <a "
"href=\\collectivebargaining.htm\\>collective bargaining</a> at "
"transnational company level. Furthermore, most IFAs provide procedures "
"whereby the signatories may jointly develop implementation and "
"monitoring procedures while corporate codes of conduct are implemented "
"and monitored only by the companies themselves.</p> <p>For TNEs, IFAs "
"represent a means to foster industrial peace through the deepening of "
"dialogue with their employees and trade unions. Furthermore, TNEs sign "
"IFAs in order to promote a positive public image aimed at avoiding "
"potentially economically damaging public campaigns, gaining access to "
"capital and product markets, and building up good relations with "
"political and economic decision-makers. The GUFs view IFAs as an "
"opportunity to engage TNEsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά operations in a process "
"of private standard-setting in order to improve the conditions of "
"workers and trade unions worldwide.</p> <p>Although there are "
"variations in the contents of IFAs, all of the agreements are based on "
"<a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/norm/index.htm\\>ILO "
"Core Labour Standards</a>. The majority of the IFAs refer to United "
"Nations Conventions <a "
"href=\\http://www.actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/law/con87.htm\\>No. "
"87</a> on the freedom of association and <a "
"href=\\http://www.actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/law/con98.htm\\>No. "
"98</a> on the right to collective bargaining.</p> <p>A number of IFAs "
"also refer to Convention <a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C135\\>No. 135</a> "
"on the non-discrimination of labour representatives. Most of the IFAs "
"explicitly recognise the ILO conventions <a "
"href=\\http://www.actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/law/con29.htm\\>No. "
"29</a> and <a "

"href=\\http://www.actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/law/con138.htm\\>No. "
"138</a> and <a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C182\\>No. 182</a> "
"on the elimination of child labour. Various agreements go beyond the "
"recognition of the ILO Core Labour Standards in ensuring also decent "
"wages and working conditions as well as a safe and hygienic "
"environment. In certain cases, IFAs are used as a tool to extend "
"labour policies and cooperative industrial relations to the "
"companyΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs locations outside the home country.</p> "
"<p>By the end of 2012, <a "
"href=\\http://www.ewcdb.eu/list_intl_framework_agreements.php\\>113 "
"IFAs</a> had been signed. The majority of the agreements came into "
"being after 2000. In most cases, the request to negotiate IFAs came "
"from the home country <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/tradeunions.htm\\>trade "
"unions</a> and EWCs. The Commission has set up a <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=978&amp;langId=en\\>database "
"of transnational company agreements</a> ΓΆβ‚¬β€ both IFAs "
"and EFAs ΓΆβ‚¬β€ containing details on every company and "
"agreement.</p> <p>Provisions for the implementation of an IFA and for "
"effective monitoring seem to be important if the agreement is to have "
"any real impact. Experiences with the implementation of existing IFAs "
"vary considerably. In some instances, employees have merely been "
"informed about the existence of an IFA, in others, concrete steps have "
"been taken to build international union networks and to develop action "
"plans to make fullest use of the IFAs to ensure that complaints are "
"acted on.</p> <p>In various instances, at least one annual meeting is "
"devoted to the monitoring of the application of the agreement. These "
"meetings often coincide with meetings of the EWC or World Works "
"Council (WWC). Sometimes the monitoring is supported by "
"non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p> <p>It has to be recognised "
"that no legal enforcement mechanisms exist at the global level. This "
"means that any enforcement of IFA provisions relies on the readiness "
"of management to cooperate or on the capacity of trade unions to "
"compel companies to resolve complaints.</p> <p>To date, there have "
"been relatively few examples of instances where complaints have been "
"raised under an IFA. Where complaints have been heard, they often "
"relate to breaches of the IFA provisions on freedom of association and "
"the right to collectively bargain. Although IFAs are designed to be "
"useful in countries where labour legislation is insufficient or poorly "
"enforced, case study research shows that IFAs find application also in "
"old and new EU Member States.</p> <p>The <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2008/102/en/2/EF08102EN.pdf\\>Eurofound "
"report</a> draws the following conclusions on IFAs:</p> <p>IFAs serve "
"to promote key features of the respective national models of social "
"partnership and cooperative industrial relations. This implies that "
"IFAs are clearly present in TNEs whose headquarters are located in "
"social market economies characterised by collective interest "
"representation as the basis for the regulation of work and the labour "
"market, while there are only a few examples of IFAs in liberal market "
"economies.</p> <p>The spread of IFAs, particularly among TNEs from "
"outside continental Europe, has so far remained quite limited and it "
"is probably unlikely that the situation will change in the near future "
"given the evolution of the strategies of the social partners at global "
"level. In that event, the existing IFAs might just remain a "
"significant but restricted number of positive cases.</p> <p>See also: "

"<br /> <p>Joint opinions are formal expressions of the results of the "
"social dialogue, which do not impose any obligations on the parties. "
"They emerged as one response to complex problems requiring compromise "
"between the parties concerned. On the initiative of Jacques Delors, "
"the incoming President of the Commission, the <a "
"href=\\europeansocialpartners.htm\\>European social partners</a> met "
"first at the castle of <a href=\\valduchesse.htm\\>Val Duchesse</a> "
"outside Brussels on 31 January 1985; following their second meeting on "
"12 November 1985, they decided to set up two joint working parties. A "
"macroeconomic working group adopted two ΓΆβ‚¬Λjoint "
"opinionsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά on 6 November 1986 and 26 November 1987, "
"and a Working Party on New Technologies adopted a joint opinion on "
"training and motivation, and information and consultation on 6 March "
"1987. Further working parties were set up and further joint opinions "
"were produced in the years that followed. Since 1985, sectoral social "
"dialogue committees have been set up in 40 different industrial "
"sectors and the European social partners have adopted over 70 "
"cross-industry and 500 sectoral joint texts.</p> <p>At the outset of "
"the social dialogue in 1985, the <a "
"href=\\europeansocialpartners.htm\\>European social partners</a> were "
"ambivalent about the formal outcomes of the process of <a "
"href=\\socialdialogue.htm\\>social dialogue</a> in which they were "
"involved. They did not necessarily undertake a commitment to what "
"Article 118B of the EC Treaty inserted by the Single European Act 1986 "
"characterised as ΓΆβ‚¬Λrelations based on "
"agreement.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Almost two decades later, the process of "
"formulating ΓΆβ‚¬Λjoint opinionsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά was "
"evaluated positively in the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"Communication of 26 June 2002: The European social dialogue, a force "
"for innovation and change (COM (2002) 341 final): "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λenabled [the social partners] to explore and discuss "
"together the key themes of the European venture: setting in place a "
"cooperation strategy on economic policy, completion of the internal "
"market, application of the Social Charter of the Fundamental Rights of "
"Workers [1989] and preparation of economic and monetary "
"unionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>However, the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Communication of 2002 highlighted the "
"perceived weakness of Joint Opinions:</p> <p><i>The European social "
"partners have adopted joint opinions, statements and declarations and "
"recommendations on numerous occasions. More than 230 such joint "
"sectoral texts have been issued and some 40 cross-industry "
"textsΓΆβ‚¬Β¦ However, in most cases, these texts did not "
"include any provision for implementation and monitoring: they were "
"responses to short-term concerns. They are not well known and their "
"dissemination at national level has been limited. Their effectiveness "
"can thus be called into question.</i></p> <p>The Commission was "
"emphatic about the need to distinguish joint opinions from other "
"outcomes of the <a href=\\europeansocialdialogue.htm\\>European social "
"dialogue</a> ΓΆβ‚¬β€ specifically, agreements. The "
"Commission recommended that, ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe social partners should "

"arises. In this way, the <a "
"href=\\preliminaryreferenceprocedure.htm\\>preliminary reference "
"procedure</a> has been instrumental in developing an EU judicial "
"system with the ECJ at its apex, handing down decisions, which bind "

"scope for any reasonable doubt in deciding the case.</p> <p>The ECJ "
"has been concerned to persuade national courts that references should "
"be made. It acknowledges that the answer to the question of EU law may "
"not be obvious, given ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe characteristic features of "
"Union law and the particular difficulties to which its interpretation "
"gives rise.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά It urges the national court to bear in "
"mind that EU legislation is in multiple languages, all equally "
"authentic, that EU law has a terminology, which is peculiar to it, "
"that legal concepts do not have the same meaning in EU law and Member "
"State laws; and that a profound and detailed understanding of the "
"context of EU law, its objectives and evolution are important for "
"interpretation ((<i>CILFIT &amp; Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v. Ministry "

"<br /> <p>A judicial system whereby individuals seeking remedies "

"href=\\enforcementofeulaw.htm\\>enforcement of EU law</a> on "

"enforcement of EU law could have followed one of at least two "

"the national judicial system of each Member State, using the national "
"system of remedies, procedures and sanctions to enforce EU law on "
"employment and industrial relations.</p> <p>Alternatively, the attempt "
"might be made to create an entirely original form of judicial system. "
"This would mean developing a new and uniform EU law on remedies, "
"procedures and sanctions, to which the national judicial systems of "
"all Member States must conform. This solution would require the EU "
"institutions to prescribe a system of harmonised rules on enforcement "
"covering <a href=\\remediesforinfringementsofeulaw.htm\\>remedies for "
"infringements of EU law</a>, procedures and <a "
"href=\\sanctions.htm\\>sanctions</a>. The legislative organs of the EU "
"have refused to do so; there is lacking a consensus among Member "
"States that this is either necessary or desirable.</p> <p>The failure "
"to develop a uniform system of enforcement of EU labour law means that "
"there is considerable diversity among Member States with regard to the "
"efficacy of enforcement of generally applicable EU law on employment "
"and industrial relations. Those Member States with less efficacious "
"remedies, more procedural restrictions, and weaker sanctions may "
"better be able to avoid compliance with EU labour law, by effectively "
"reducing the likelihood of judicial remedies for those benefiting from "
"it, or the likelihood of liability of those subject to it.</p> <p>The "

"in securing enforcement of EU law, including labour law. Article 4(3) "
"TEU sets out Member State obligations regarding compliance with EU "
"law.</p> <p>National judiciaries are also organs of the Member States, "
"and, as such, incur responsibility for ensuring fulfilment of the "

"<br /> <p>A legal matter is justiciable when it can be the basis for a "
"claim or a complaint before a court. Not all legal issues are "
"justiciable. For example, there was considerable debate over whether "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛsubsidiarityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά was justiciable. It was "
"not clear whether courts, including the <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a>, "
"could adjudicate on complaints that laws adopted by the EU "
"institutions violated subsidiarity. It appears to be generally agreed "
"that the subsidiarity principle is not justiciable.</p> "
"<p>Justiciability is one aspect of enforcement of EU law, focusing on "
"the judicial system. For example, the doctrine of <a "
"href=\\verticaldirecteffect.htm\\>vertical direct effect</a> means "
"that provisions of <a href=\\directives.htm\\>directives</a>, which "
"contain most of the rules in the field of EU employment and industrial "
"relations, may be justiciable against the State. Most directives in "
"the field of employment and industrial relations include a provision "
"on justiciability. For example, <a "

"<p>Other EU legal measures, such as <a "

"\\n"
"        <p>The cost of labour includes both direct and indirect labour "
"costs. Hourly direct labour costs may be defined as direct hourly pay: "
"basic pay plus\\n"
"        overtime, shift and other regularly paid premiums. In "
"addition, there may be additional elements of direct labour costs such "
"as holiday pay, Christmas\\n"
"        bonus payments and irregular cash payments and bonuses. "
"Indirect costs of labour include employer contributions to social "

"        other social payments and vocational training costs.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The creation of the single European market exposes "

"        (such as dismissal protection, social security contributions "
"and other forms of taxation) should be considered, also recognised "
"that harmonisation of\\n"
"        direct costs (rules governing wages and salaries) was "
"unnecessary because ΓΆβ‚¬Λdifferences in productivity levels "
"attenuate these differences in unit\\n"
"        labour costs to a considerable degreeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (COM "
"(90) 228). Indeed, this aspect of competition, aimed at rewarding "

"contributing to social protection schemes. Lower labour and social "
"standards in some Member\\n"
"        States may entail lower indirect labour costs for enterprises "
"in those Member States. The result is to give enterprises in those "

"        indirect labour costs a potential competitive advantage "
"compared with enterprises in Member States with higher labour and "

"posted workers were affiliated. The Swedish trade union then took "
"collective action by means of a blockade of all Laval sites in Sweden "
"and this action was supported by other Swedish trade unions. Laval "
"brought proceedings in the Swedish courts for a declaration that the "
"trade union action was unlawful in that it conflicted with rights "
"established under Art 49 EC (now Article 56 of the Treaty on the "
"Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). The Laval case went to the "

"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:051:0011:0011:EN:PDF\\>Viking "
"case (88Kb PDF)</a> which similarly dealt with the lawfulness of "
"industrial action which had the effect of placing restrictions on the "
"freedom to provide services.</p> <p>The freedom to provide "
"cross-border services is set out in <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E049:EN:HTML\\>Article "

"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E043:EN:HTML\\>freedom "
"of establishment</a>, is acknowledged as a ΓΆβ‚¬Λfundamental "
"freedomΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά central to the effective functioning of the "
"EU Internal Market. The principle of the freedom to provide services "
"enables an economic operator providing services in one Member State to "
"offer services on a temporary basis in another Member State, without "
"having to be established. Furthermore, these Treaty provisions have "
"direct effect so that Member States must modify national laws that "
"restrict this freedom or otherwise is not compatible with the "
"TreatyΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs principles.</p> <p><a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0071:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"96/71</a> on <a href=\\postedworkers.htm\\>posted workers</a> sets out "
"minimum standards that must apply in the case of workers posted from "
"one Member State to work in another. Article 3 of the directive states "
"that Member States should ensure that terms and conditions established "
"by law, or by universally applicable collective agreements, apply to "
"posted workers, in particular in relation to minimum work periods, "
"breaks, annual holidays and rates of pay.</p> <p>The ECJ in Laval held "
"that the right to take collective action must be recognised as a "
"fundamental right forming an integral part of the general principles "
"of Community law. Additionally, the right to take such action against "
"possible <a href=\\socialdumping.htm\\>social dumping</a> may "
"constitute an overriding reason of public interest. However, this does "
"not mean that Community law does not apply in relation to such action. "
"The ECJ noted that industrial action aimed at obtaining terms and "
"conditions which went beyond the minimum established by law made it "
"less attractive for undertakings such as Laval to carry out its "
"business in the Member State and therefore constituted a restriction "
"on the freedom to provide services, guaranteed under the Treaty. The "
"ECJ noted that while Article 3 of the posted workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"directive gave a right to minimum terms and conditions to posted "
"workers, these rights had to have been underpinned either by law or "
"universally applicable collective agreements. In Sweden, there was no "
"statutory minimum wage nor were collective agreements universally "
"applicable. Consequently industrial action to impose terms, in the "
"absence of legally enforceable national provisions, could not be "
"justified under EU law. The court went further than this. It also held "
"that failure to take account of the collective agreement reached "
"between the employer and the Latvian trade union amounted to "
"discrimination against both organisations, given that action to ensure "
"that terms and conditions were in line with those generally applicable "
"in Sweden did not amount to a public policy, security or health "
"requirement.</p> <p>Shortly after the decisions in Viking and Laval, "
"the Second Chamber of the ECJ gave its judgement in the <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:128:0009:0009:EN:PDF\\>RΓƒΒΌffert "
"case (100Kb PDF)</a> which concerned national legislation on the award "
"of public contracts, which provided that these would only be awarded "
"to undertakings which agreed in writing to pay workers at least the "
"rate provided in the collective agreement and to ensure that "
"sub-contractors did the same. Here, too, the court ruled that "
"Directive 96/71 precluded an authority of a Member State from adopting "
"a measure which would require contractors for public "
"worksΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά contracts to agree to pay their workers at the "
"rate set by the collective agreement.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>The macroeconomic dialogue is a form of discussion between "
"the European Central Bank, the Council, the Commission and the "
"European social partners (<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>, "

"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/businesseurope.htm\\>BUSINESSEUROPE</a>, "
"<a href=\\ueapme.htm\\>UEAPME</a>). Now over decade old, it was "
"established by the European Council at its meeting of June 1999 in "
"Cologne. A biannual event, the forum is designed to contribute to "
"monetary and budgetary policies as well as wage developments. Through "
"such dialogue, it is hoped that social partners will not only achieve "
"a better understanding of the economic problems faced by the EU, but "
"equally agree on joint solutions.</p> <p>The impulse for macroeconomic "
"dialogue came in the late 1990s, with the introduction of the single "
"currency leading some political actors, particularly "
"EuropeΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs social democratic parties, to call for the "
"macroeconomic coordination of monetary, fiscal and wage policies in "
"the Keynesian tradition. As EU president at the time, Austria, a "
"country with experience of such macroeconomic coordination, organised "
"an international social partner conference to address this issue on "
"September 28ΓΆβ‚¬β€29 1998 in Vienna. Towards the end of "
"1998, both France and Germany backed such a policy initiative at the "
"EU Council Summit in Vienna. However, such a position faced opposition "
"from other member states. The European Central Bank (ECB) also voiced "
"its reservations. While the ECB was committed to participating in "
"macroeconomic dialogue, any such participation was dependent on it "
"retaining its independence. As a consequence of such reservations, "
"macroeconomic dialogue is non-binding, with the ΓΆβ‚¬Λopen "
"method of coordinationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά notion being the preferred "
"procedure.</p> <p>Delegates and experts from the Council, the "
"Commission, the social partners and the ECB participate in the "
"technical and political sessions that constitute such dialogue. The "
"technical part of the dialogue, chaired by a member of the Economic "
"Policy Committee, sets the agenda for the political meeting. At the "
"political meeting, business, employee and EU interests are represented "
"by various officials. The autonomy of the parties is fully respected "
"and the discussions are confidential. The process is not binding: no "
"formal conclusions are drawn and each party is responsible for "
"reporting back to its own constituency.</p> <p>ETUC views the "
"macroeconomic dialogue as a way of building a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛconsensualΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά European monetary, fiscal "
"and wage policy and has suggested a European ΓΆβ‚¬Λframework "
"formulaΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά for collective bargaining based on "
"compensation for inflation plus productivity. "
"EuropeΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs trade unions are also in favour of reforming "
"macroeconomic dialogue. These include more regular forum meetings, "
"improved publicity about what it does as well as the need for closer "
"relations with Member States. However, the ECB, some Member States and "
"the European employer organisations have displayed no interest so far "
"in such a coordination of European monetary, fiscal and wage policy. "
"As a result, the macroeconomic dialogue remains an informal "
"information and consultation forum of the major European monetary, "
"fiscal and wage policy actors.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>The term ΓΆβ‚¬Λmaritime labour "

"initially established at international level through the International "
"Labour Organisation (<a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm\\>ILO</a>), that "
"seek to regulate the maritime industry. They aim to ensure that "
"workers in the sector have proper <a "
"href=\\healthandsafety.htm\\>health and safety</a> protection and that "
"entitlement to minimum pay and conditions is respected. They also "
"cover national obligations in relation to the inspection of ships.</p> "
"<p>Since its foundation in 1919, the ILO has adopted more than 65 <a "
"href=\\internationallabourstandards.htm\\>international labour "
"standards</a> covering the maritime industry. In 2006, these were "
"consolidated into a single <a "
"href=\\http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C186\\>Maritime "
"Labour Convention</a>. The convention recognises, as a fundamental "
"right, the right of workers to <a "
"href=\\freedomofassociation.htm\\>freedom of association</a> and <a "
"href=\\collectivebargaining.htm\\>collective bargaining</a>. It also "
"calls for the elimination of forced and <a "
"href=\\childlabour.htm\\>child labour</a> and for the eradication of "
"<a href=\\discrimination.htm\\>discrimination</a> in employment. The "
"European Commission actively participated in the work towards the "
"adoption of the 2006 Convention from its outset.</p> "
"<p>EuropeΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs seafarers have historically benefited "
"from the ILO protections. However, specific protection at European "
"level has also existed. <a "
"href=\\http://eurlex.nu/doc/31999L0095.en\\>Council Directive "
"1999/95/EC</a>, on the organisation of the working time of seafarers, "
"provides a mechanism for the verification and enforcement of "
"compliance with the Convention in respect of ships calling at the "
"ports of Member States. Its aim is to improve maritime safety, working "
"conditions and the health and safety of seafarers on board. The "
"directive put into effect an earlier agreement of the European "
"Community ShipownersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Associations (ECSA) and the "
"European Transport WorkersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Federation (ETF) "
"(formerly the Federation of Transport WorkersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"Unions), that in turn reflected the provisions of <a "
"href=\\http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/seafarershours1996.html\\>ILO "
"Convention No. 180</a>, adopted in 1996, concerning "
"seafarersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά hours of work and the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛmanningΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of ships. The agreement, and "
"the subsequent Council directive, applies to seafarers on board every "
"seagoing ship, whether publicly or privately owned, registered in the "
"territory of any Member State and ordinarily engaged in commercial "
"maritime operations. In addition, it imposes specific duties on Member "
"States to monitor compliance with its provisions. To this end, Member "
"States must:</p> <ul> <li>carry out inspections on board ships, "
"notably after having received a complaint in relation to the safe "
"operation of the ship, shipboard living and working conditions or the "
"prevention of pollution;</li> <li>designate, as appropriate, Port "
"State Control inspectors to carry out inspections on board vessels "
"calling at Community ports;</li> <li>verify shipboard working "
"arrangements and seafarersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά records of hours of work "
"or hours of rest;</li> <li>impose a prohibition on leaving the port "
"until the deficiencies found have been rectified or the crew is "
"sufficiently rested.</li> </ul> <p>Following the consolidation of the "
"2006 Convention, in July 2007, the <a "
"href=\\counciloftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Council of the European "
"Union</a> adopted a decision authorising Member States to ratify the "
"ILO Maritime Labour Convention 2006 in the interests of the European "
"Community, preferably before 31 December 2010. The adoption of the "
"2006 Convention, as well as the Commission consultation launched under "
"Article 138 EC (now Article 154 TFEU), were the catalyst for the "
"signing of a new joint agreement of the European social partners, ECSA "
"and ETF, on <a href=\\labourstandards.htm\\>labour standards</a> in "
"the maritime industry. This agreement, concluded on the first European "
"Maritime Day on 20 May 2008, adopted the principal provisions of the "
"2006 Convention. It provides protection for seafarers excluded from EU "
"legislation on training, health and safety, <a "
"href=\\annualleave.htm\\>annual leave</a>, <a "
"href=\\workingtime.htm\\>working time</a> and <a "
"href=\\restperiods.htm\\>rest periods</a>. It also covers "
"accommodation, recreational activities, food and catering, medical "
"care and welfare and sets a minimum age for ΓΆβ‚¬Λany person "
"who is employed or engaged or works in any capacity on board a "
"shipΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Following the signing of the agreement, on 2 "
"July 2008 the European Commission proposed a Council Directive (COM "
"(2008) 422 final) (120Kb PDF) to implement the terms of the agreement. "
"The proposed directive will ensure that the "
"agreementΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs provisions are transposed into the laws "
"of the Member States. The new directive will expressly amend Council "
"Directive 1999/63/EC on the organisation of working time of seafarers "
"and will also complement Council Directive 94/33/EC (24Kb PDF) on the "

"<br /> <p>There is no official definition of migration in the European "

"be 20.2 million. Economic and political forecasts predict that "
"immigration will continue to grow in the future and this has lead to "
"the adoption of policies favouring the development of a common "
"approach to migration. Two factors have led to pressure for a more "
"effective EU strategy to promote the economic, social, cultural, and "
"political integration of migrants and the next generation: recognition "
"of the failure to integrate past migrants effectively, and concern "
"about rising support for the far right.</p> <p>Since 1999, the "

"significant differences between countries. Austria, the Czech "

"experienced a marked growth of inflow both in absolute and in relative "
"terms. In other countries, the upward trend is less pronounced, and in "
"the case of Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands a declining trend can "
"be detected, which is likely to be related to the restrictive "
"migration policies of these countries in recent years. It also notes "
"that in most countries, migrant workers face higher unemployment rates "

"        <p>Mobbing at work is characterised by the systematic "

"\\n"

"        term used in the early 1970s by a Swedish physician to "
"describe hostile behavior observed among schoolchildren. Leymann "
"defines mobbing as ΓΆβ‚¬Λhostile and\\n"
"        unethical communication, which is directed in a systematic way "
"by one or a few individuals mainly towards one individual who, due to "
"mobbing, is pushed\\n"

"EU citizens enjoy the right to take up paid employment in another "

"facilitating and structuring worker mobility by providing more "
"guarantees for both employers and employees.</p> <p>Current figures, "

"ever moved to another Member State and only 3% outside the Union. The "
"study shows that different Member States have different mobility "
"intentions; that young and educated workers are the most likely to "
"move; and that mobility goes hand in hand with economic success. These "
"data are confirmed by a European Commission study, <a "

"<br /> <p>In March 2012, the European Commission (<a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/\\>EC</a>) issued a proposal which it "
"called the <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=7480&amp;langId=en\\>Monti "
"II Regulation (80Kb PDF)</a>. Its purpose was to address the concerns "
"of trade unions that economic freedoms established in the EC Treaty "
"were being given priority over fundamental social rights such as the "
"right to strike. Unions had aired their concerns as a result of <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"(ECJ) rulings in the <a href=\\vikingcase.htm\\>Viking case</a> and "
"the <a href=\\lavalcase.htm\\>Laval case</a> which raised questions "
"about the relationship between market freedoms and fundamental social "
"rights.</p> <p>The proposed Monti II Regulation confirmed that there "
"was no primacy of the freedom to provide services or of establishment "
"over the right to strike, while recognising that situations may arise "
"where these freedoms and rights may have to be reconciled in "
"accordance with the principle of proportionality. The proposal "
"introduced an alert mechanism in order to provide other Member States "
"and the Commission with ΓΆβ‚¬Λtimely and "
"transparentΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά information on serious acts or "
"circumstances affecting the effective exercise of the freedom of "
"establishment or the freedom to provide services.</p> <p>However, in "
"September 2012, 12 national Parliaments adopted reasoned opinions "
"expressing concerns related to the added value of the draft Monti II "
"Regulation, the choice of its legal basis and the European Union (<a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu/index_en.htm\\>EU</a>) competence to regulate "
"this matter.</p> <p>Although the Commission was of the view that the "
"principle of subsidiarity had not been breached, it nevertheless "
"recognised that this proposal was unlikely to gather the necessary "
"political support within the <a "
"href=\\europeanparliament.htm\\>European Parliament</a> and <a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/european-council/index_en.htm\\>European "
"Council</a> to enable its adoption. Consequently, it withdrew this "
"proposal on 26 September 2012, hoping that this would lead to a rapid "
"negotiation of the other part of the package, the proposal for an <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=7479&amp;langId=en\\>Enforcement "

"<br /> <p>National labour courts are responsible for the enforcement "

"relations which forms part of the national legal system. <a "
"href=\\enforcementofeulaw.htm\\>Enforcement of EU law</a> by national "
"labour courts depends on the existence of substantive rights. National "
"labour courts can intervene only where there is substantive EU law, "
"which confers rights to be enforced. Where there is an EU law to be "
"enforced by national labour courts, EU law may operate to expand "
"domestic remedies, procedures and <a "
"href=\\sanctions.htm\\>sanctions</a> to protect that right.</p> <p>EU "
"law thereby infiltrates Member State laws through national labour "
"courts in the form of various EU law doctrines, such as the direct "
"enforceability of directives having a clear, precise and unconditional "
"content (<a href=\\directeffect.htm\\>direct effect</a> doctrine) or "
"the doctrine requiring domestic law to be interpreted consistently "
"with EU law (<a href=\\indirecteffect.htm\\>indirect effect</a> "
"doctrine). Where domestic law, permeated by EU law, is not adequately "
"enforced, the <a href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of "
"Justice</a> (ECJ) has developed doctrines concerning the remedies, "
"procedures and sanctions required to achieve the effectiveness "
"required by EU law. In effect, the ECJ engages national labour courts "
"in the enforcement of EU law. This can be seen as a subtle strategy of "
"cooperation.</p> <p>Naturally, this process has not been "
"uncontroversial, where enforcement of EU law has impinged directly on "
"Member States. For example, the prospect of empowering national courts "
"to uphold the ECJΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs doctrine of liability of Member "
"States for <a href=\\infringementsofeulaw.htm\\>infringements of EU "
"law</a>, perhaps in conditions where national law limits state "
"liability, has created anxiety among Member States. This anxiety may "
"be somewhat alleviated, because the application of EU law by national "
"labour courts is inevitably influenced by their experience in "
"enforcing national labour law.</p> <p>However, it is one task of the "
"European Court of Justice to secure a degree of uniformity in the "
"interpretation and application of EU labour law by national courts in "
"different Member States. This task leads to a relationship between "
"national labour courts and the ECJ, which can be described as a form "
"of dialogue.</p> <p>Interaction between national labour courts and the "
"ECJ arises from the <a "
"href=\\preliminaryreferenceprocedure.htm\\>preliminary reference "
"procedure</a> in Article 267 TFEU. National labour courts may, and the "
"highest court is obliged to, refer questions to the ECJ concerning "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λ(a) the interpretation of this Treaty; (b) the validity "
"and interpretation of acts of the institutions of the "
"Community.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά The ECJ is therefore dependent on the "
"willingness of national labour courts to make references to it, while "
"national labour courts are bound by the decisions of the ECJ once "
"references are made.</p> <p>The ECJΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs interventions "
"will reflect a sensibility aimed at reassuring national labour courts "
"as to the positive outcome of preliminary references. The ECJ must "
"balance the requirements of EU law with respect for national "
"traditions of employment and industrial relations, and respect for the "

"<br /> <p>NEET is an acronym for ΓΆβ‚¬Λnot in employment, "
"education or trainingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, used to refer to the "
"situation of many young persons ΓΆβ‚¬β€ typically aged "
"between 15 and 24 ΓΆβ‚¬β€ in Europe and beyond.</p> <p>This "
"acronym first emerged in the UK in the late 1980s, reflecting an "
"alternative way of categorising young people following changes in "
"unemployment benefit policies. Since then, interest in the NEET group "
"has grown at EU policy level, and NEET-equivalent definitions have "
"been created in almost all Member States. The aim of the NEET concept "
"is to broaden understanding of the vulnerable status of young people "
"and to better monitor their problematic access to the labour "
"market.</p> <p>The definition of NEET agreed by the European "
"Commission Employment Committee (EMCO) includes young people aged "
"15ΓΆβ‚¬β€24 years who are unemployed or inactive, as per "
"the International Labour Organization (ILO) definition, and who are "
"not attending any education or training courses. The definition was "
"applied by Eurostat in its statistical data and the indicator "
"subsequently used in the context of the <a "
"href=\\europe2020.htm\\>Europe2020</a> strategy.</p> <p>Youth "
"unemployment is one of the major challenges of EU employment policy: "
"the average rate of youth unemployment in the EU is currently well "
"over 23% (23.5% in the EU27 according to Eurostat figures for February "
"2013). In 2011, the share of young people in the NEET group (often "
"referred to as NEETs) was 12.9% of the population of those aged "
"15ΓΆβ‚¬β€24 in the EU27, which corresponds approximately to "
"7.5 million young people. For those aged 25ΓΆβ‚¬β€29, this "
"figure stood at almost 20% in 2010, amounting to 6.5 million young "
"people.</p> <p>To address this situation, the Commission devised <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/youthonthemove/\\>Youth on the Move</a>, "
"one of the <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm\\>Europe 2020</a> "
"flagship policies, to help young people gain access to training or the "
"labour market. Since then, various Commission policy documents earmark "
"the reduction of the NEET rate as one of the main priorities for "
"integrating young people into the labour market. The 2012 Commission "
"Communication <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0173:FIN:EN:PDF\\>Towards "
"a job-rich recovery (120KB PDF)</a> ΓΆβ‚¬β€ issued as part "
"of its Employment Package ΓΆβ‚¬β€ emphasises the importance "
"of tackling the NEET crisis and suggests making greater use of the "
"European Social Fund (ESF) for the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs next "
"programme period (2014ΓΆβ‚¬β€2020). One proposal was a <a "
"href=\\http://www.consilium.europa.eu/homepage/highlights/council-agrees-on-youth-guarantee?lang=en\\>youth "
"guarantee</a> as a priority investment for the sustainable integration "
"of NEETs into the labour market.</p> <p>According to the widely cited "
"2012 Eurofound report ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef1254.htm\\>NEETs "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ Young people not in employment, education or "
"training: Characteristics, costs and policy responses in "
"Europe</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, there is considerable variation in the "
"NEET rate between EU Member States, varying from below 7% (Luxembourg "
"and the Netherlands) to over 17% (Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy and "
"Spain).</p> <p>NEETs are a highly heterogeneous population. The "
"largest subgroup tends to be those who are conventionally unemployed. "
"Other vulnerable subgroups include sick and disabled persons and young "
"carers, as well as discouraged workers and young people who are "
"disengaged from society. Non-vulnerable subgroups include young people "
"simply taking time out and those constructively engaged in other "
"activities such as art, music and self-directed learning. Some young "
"people are at greater risk of being NEET than others. Those with low "
"levels of education are three times more likely to be NEET compared to "
"those with tertiary education, while young people with an immigrant "
"background are 70% more likely to become NEET than nationals. Young "
"people suffering from some kind of disability or health issues are 40% "
"more likely to be NEET than those in good health. Family background "
"also has a crucial influence. Being a NEET has severe adverse "
"consequences for the individual, society and the economy. Spending "
"time as a NEET may lead to a wide range of social disadvantages, such "
"as alienation, insecure and poor employment prospects, delinquency, "
"and mental and physical health problems.</p> <p>In 2011, the economic "
"loss due to the disengagement of young people from the labour market "
"in Europe was estimated to be ΓΆβ€Β¬153 billion, "
"corresponding to 1.2% of European gross domestic product (GDP). There "
"is great variation between Member States, but some countries are "
"paying an especially high price of 2% or more of their GDP: Bulgaria, "
"Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia and Poland.</p> <p>See "

"2003/10/EC</a> on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding "
"the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents "
"(noise), replacing an earlier directive of 1986. The aim of the "
"directive is to protect workers from risks arising from exposure to "
"noise. The directive lowers the permitted exposure action levels from "
"85 and 90 dB(A) to 80 and 85 dB(A) respectively, and introduces an "
"exposure limit value of 87 dB(A), above which exposure, taking hearing "
"protection into account, must be prohibited. The upper exposure action "
"value over an 8-hour period has been set at 85 dB(A), above which it "
"will be obligatory for workers to wear individual hearing "
"protectors.</p> <p>The directive stipulates that an employer must "
"implement measures to reduce exposure to a minimum and provide "
"appropriate health surveillance: checking the effectiveness of "
"personal protection measures and consulting with workers and/or their "
"representatives in the assessment of risks, the identification of "
"measures, actions reducing risks and choice of individual hearing "
"protectors. The specific nature of the music and entertainment "
"sectors, a key issue in the debates over the revision of the "
"directive, will be taken into account in the implementation of the "

"<br /> <p>The non-discrimination principle requires the equal "

"        sectors of the economy and is particularly acute in "

"        costs to the company, particularly small companies. Preventing "

"        Statistics published by the European Union statistical office, "

"        stability of employment but, on the contrary, on the "
"adaptation of workers to economic change: occupational mobility. The "
"creation of a common market\\n"

"        redeployment of workers who lost their jobs, as well as "
"helping workers search for work elsewhere or to retrain for other "
"jobs. The idea was that\\n"
"        workers ought not to have to bear the consequences of economic "
"change, made inevitable by technical progress. The Paris Treaty gave "

"        Authority powers to finance substantial resettlement schemes, "

"<br /> <p>Offshoring is when a business process is delocalised or "
"outsourced outside of the countryΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs borders. The "
"offshored activity may either continue to be owned by the company or "
"may be outsourced offshore.</p> <p>Offshoring is a specific type of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/restructuring.htm\\>restructuring</a>. "
"It occurs when a domestic economic activity is replaced by foreign "
"production of goods or services due to a producerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"decision to cease or reduce a specific domestic activity in order to "
"purchase or outsource it abroad. The definition implies the continued "
"presence of the original producer company in the home country. It also "
"implies that the offshored activities may either continue to be owned "
"by the company or may be outsourced.</p> <p>In general, offshored "
"business processes include the production of goods and services. In "
"the case of the production of goods, offshoring involves domestic "
"companies producing or purchasing (intermediate) products abroad. In "
"the case of services, offshoring frequently relies on the use of "
"information technology providing for cross-border data transmissions "
"or cross-border voice transactions, as in the case of call "
"centres.</p> <p>The aim of offshoring business processes consists of "
"the reduction of costs, which may be achieved through lower labour "
"costs, attractive regulatory environments or the proximity to sales "
"markets. In most cases, the offshoring of domestic production "
"activities concerns labour-intensive activities that are moved abroad "
"in order to take advantage of lower wage costs.</p> <p>The <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/enlargement.htm\\>enlargement</a> "
"of the European Union as well as the creation of other regional free "
"trade areas such as NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) and "
"CAFTA (Central America Free Trade Agreement) have facilitated the "
"establishment of companies in countries with lower production costs. "
"The growth of offshoring in the services sector is also linked to "
"technological progress in the field of telecommunication. Finally, the "
"decreasing costs of transportation also contributed to making "
"offshoring more affordable.</p> <p>With regard to the impact on "
"employment, data collected by the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeanrestructuringmonitor.htm\\>European "
"Restructuring Monitor</a> <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emcc/erm/index.htm\\>(ERM)</a> "
"indicate that the offshoring of jobs from the European Union to "
"lower-cost countries accounts for only a relatively small proportion "
"of the overall number of job losses. According to the ERM, between "
"2003 and 2006, offshoring accounted for around 8% of all jobs "
"lost.</p> <p>Manufacturing dominates the offshoring statistics. In "
"Europe, half of the jobs that are lost in the EU15 to other countries "
"are in manufacturing sectors; most of these go to central and eastern "
"European Member States or to Asia. Offshoring occurs in rather "
"labour-intensive mid-tech sectors in the EU15 and in lower-tech "
"sectors in the new Member States. The only service sector with "
"significant offshoring is banking and insurance.</p> <p><b>In general, "
"offshoring processes affect blue-collar workers in sectors undergoing "
"structural change due to globalisation. However,</b> white-collar "
"workers are increasingly among those workers whose jobs are vulnerable "
"as a result of offshoring activities. In the services sector, "
"occupations at risk are defined as those with an intensive use of "
"information and communication technologies (ICT), an output that can "
"be traded and transmitted by ICT and low face-to-face contact "
"requirements.</p> <p>As offshoring involves more than one country, <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeanworkscouncils.htm\\>European "
"Works Councils</a> (EWCs) are potentially an important forum with "
"regard to interest representation at EU level. If, on the one hand, "
"EWCs may facilitate the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/informationandconsultation.htm\\>information "
"and consultation</a> of workers by the management of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/transnationalenterprise.htm\\>transnational "
"enterprises</a> that are undertaking major restructuring processes, "
"then on the other hand, offshoring represents a particularly difficult "
"issue for EWCs due to the potential conflicting interests between the "
"representatives of different countries.</p> <p>Although there have "
"been isolated examples of EWCsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά involvement in "
"negotiations over transnational restructuring that have resulted in "
"the establishment of joint texts, from the perspective of the employee "
"representatives, it would appear that the national structures of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/employeerepresentation.htm\\>employee "
"representation</a> are still of primary importance. With regard to "
"strategies of interest representation, it is necessary to distinguish "
"between responses to actual offshoring processes and responses to the "
"threat of offshoring.</p> <p>In the case of offshoring threats, the "
"response consists of attempts to reduce incentives for offshoring. In "
"most cases, this strategy is based on proposals for cost reduction. "
"Such a strategy may lead to the singning of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/pactsforemploymentandcompetitiveness.htm\\>pacts "

"report cases in which cost reductions have been the result of "
"proactive strategies aimed at anticipating change. In these cases, "
"company-level actors succeeded in identifying likely changes and "
"planning for product and/or process innovation, thereby avoiding "
"offshoring processes.</p> <p>In cases of actual offshoring, "
"company-level actors, as well as public authorities at times, apply "
"adjustment policies that may include arrangements for compensation, "
"reconversion and identification of alternative employment "
"opportunities as well as active labour market policies consisting of "
"measures such as job-matching services, retraining and temporary "

"must be regarded as constituting, in its totality, working time for "
"the purposes of that directive, even where the person concerned is "
"permitted to rest at his place of work during the periods when his "

"precludes legislation of a Member State which classifies as rest "
"periods an employee\\'s periods of inactivity in the context of such "
"on-call dutyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>On 5 October 2004, in a further "

"cases C-397/01 to C-403/01</a>), the ECJ confirmed its ruling that "
"on-call work has to be regarded as working time and that exemptions "
"from the scope of the directive have to be interpreted in a very "
"narrow way.</p> <p>These judgements have been controversial as they "
"have resourcing and staffing implications for health and emergency "
"services. Therefore, in 2004, the European Commission issued a "
"proposal to amend and clarify the directive in relation to three "
"critical issues, one of which was the treatment of on-call working. "
"The Commission had proposed a new differentiation between active and "
"inactive parts of on-call time, whereas the European Parliament "
"favoured any period of on-call time, including inactive time, spent on "
"the employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs premises, being counted as working "
"time. A failure to reach agreement between the Commission and the "
"Parliament resulted in the matter being transmitted to a Conciliation "
"Committee in 2009. On 28 April 2009, the committee reported its "
"failure to find a compromise, the first time that no agreement could "
"be reached at the conciliation stage. In March 2010, the Commission "
"issued a first stage consultation document to the EU-level social "

"<br /> <p>The ΓΆβ‚¬Λopen method of "
"coordinationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (OMC) is a form of EU <a "
"href=\\softlaw.htm\\>soft law</a>, a process of policymaking which "
"does not lead to binding EU legislative measures nor require Member "
"States to change their law. The open method of coordination (OMC) aims "
"to spread best practices and achieve greater convergence towards the "
"main EU goals. Historically, the OMC can be seen as a reaction to the "
"EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs economic integration in the 1990s. This process "
"reduced the Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά options in the field of "
"employment policy. However, they were also reluctant to delegate more "
"powers to the European institutions and thus designed the OMC as an "
"alternative to the existing EU modes of governance.</p> <p>Generally, "
"the OMC works in stages. First, the Council of Ministers agrees on "
"policy goals. Member States then translate guidelines into national "
"and regional policies. Thirdly, specific benchmarks and indicators to "
"measure best practice are agreed upon. Finally, results are monitored "
"and evaluated. Because it is a decentralised approach, largely "
"implemented by the Member States and supervised by the <a "
"href=\\counciloftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Council of the European "
"Union</a>, the <a href=\\europeancommission.htm\\>European "
"Commission</a> has primarily a monitoring role and the involvement of "
"the <a href=\\europeanparliament.htm\\>European Parliament</a> and the "
"<a href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"is very weak indeed. Although the OMC was devised as a tool in policy "
"areas which remain a priority for national governments, it is "
"sometimes seen as a way for the Commission to ΓΆβ‚¬Λput its "
"foot in the doorΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of a national policy area.</p> "
"<p>The <a href=\\employmenttitle.htm\\>employment title</a> of the "
"Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, originally introduced "
"by the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam, is perceived as the original model of "
"the open method of coordination, encapsulated in Article 148 TFEU. "
"Employment policy is the paradigm case of the OMC: an annual report "
"leads to guidelines, which the Member States ΓΆβ‚¬Λshall take "
"into account in their employment policiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, followed "
"by an annual report on national employment policy, reviewed in a "
"report by the Council and Commission upon which the European Council "
"may make (non-binding) recommendations to Member States.</p> "
"<p>However, the OMC is not restricted to the sphere of employment. It "
"is being applied to other policy areas, such as research and "
"development, social protection, enterprise policy and immigration. The "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs <i>Social Policy Agenda</i> envisages "
"the OMC being applied to all areas of social policy; a specific "
"example is the Community Action Programme to combat discrimination, "
"adopted in November 2000 (Decision 2000/750/EC) for the period "
"2001-2005.</p> <p>The European social dialogue is not institutionally "
"integrated into the open method of coordination (OMC) on employment as "
"enshrined in the TFEU (Articles 148 to 150) and implementing the <a "
"href=\\europeanemploymentstrategy.htm\\>European Employment "
"Strategy</a> (EES). The social partners are consulted on both the "
"drafting of <a href=\\employmentguidelines.htm\\>employment "
"guidelines</a> and on their annual assessment by the European "
"Employment Committee, which is a committee composed of Member State "
"representatives assisting the Commission and the Council in the OMC "
"procedure. They are also involved through the Tripartite Social Summit "
"which prepares the Spring European Council. In addition, Article 146 "
"TFEU also states that in coordinating their national employment "
"policies, Member States should have ΓΆβ‚¬Λregard to national "
"practices related to the responsibilities of management and "
"labourΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>An institutional design could "
"integrate the best features of the <a "
"href=\\europeansocialdialogue.htm\\>European social dialogue</a> and "
"the OMC ΓΆβ‚¬β€ for example, a social dialogue process, "
"which replicates the processes and measures of the OMC in the form of "
"framework agreements at EU level, implemented at Member State level "
"through the social partners ΓΆβ‚¬Λin accordance with the "
"practices and procedures specific to management and labour and the "
"Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 155(2) TFEU). An EU-level "
"social dialogue between EU social partners could produce guidelines in "
"the form of <a href=\\frameworkagreements.htm\\>framework "
"agreements</a>; affiliated social partners at Member State level could "
"implement the guidelines, perhaps through intersectoral or sectoral "
"collective agreements; these could be reviewed by EU institutions, "
"which could supplement this action by the social partners, with "
"recommendations in the form of EU legislative proposals where "
"implementation was inadequate.</p> <p>In its Communication of 26 June "
"2002, the Commission recommended adopting the OMC for the "
"implementation of texts resulting from social dialogue. Ultimately, if "
"<a href=\\jointopinions.htm\\>joint opinions</a> and other "
"non-regulatory instruments continue to be ineffective, their failure "

"Directive 89/391/EEC</a>. The directive defines optical radiation "
"as:</p>\\r\\n"
"<p><em>&lsquo;any electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range "
"between 100 nm and 1 mm. The spectrum of optical radiation is divided "
"into ultraviolet radiation, visible radiation and infrared radiation. "
"Ionising radiation like x-rays or gamma rays, electromagnetic fields "
"such as microwaves and radio frequencies are not covered by the "
"directive.&rsquo;</em></p>\\r\\n"
"<p>The exclusion of natural sources of radiation, such as the sun, "
"from the directive was a controversial issue during the legislative "
"process.</p>\\r\\n"
"<p>The aim of the directive is the prevention and timely detection of "
"any adverse health effects on workers, as well as the prevention of "
"any long-term health risks and any risk of chronic diseases. The "
"directive lays down minimum standards for the prevention and early "
"diagnosis of damage to the eyes and skin from optical radiation, and "
"for the prevention of long-term health risks. It sets exposure limit "
"values and includes provisions on employees&rsquo; right to "
"information, training, consultation and health checks.</p>\\r\\n"
"<p>A key aspect of the preventive approach is the obligation of the "
"employer to adapt working methods to avoid or minimise the duration "
"and level of exposure, to incorporate preventive measures into the "
"design of the workplace and to provide appropriate protective "
"equipment. Adjustments of work processes should take account of "
"technical progress and scientific knowledge to control the risk at "
"source.</p>\\r\\n"
"<p>The directive stipulates that employers are obliged to carry out <a "
"href=\\riskassessment.htm\\>risk assessment</a> in line with Articles "
"6(3) and 9(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC. Where the risk assessment "
"indicates any possibility that the exposure limit values may be "
"exceeded, the employer shall devise and implement an action plan "
"comprising technical and/or organisational measures designed to "
"prevent the exposure exceeding the limit values. Workers who are "
"exposed to risks from artificial optical radiation at work and/or "
"their representatives must receive the necessary information and "
"training relating to the outcome of the risk assessment.</p>\\r\\n"
"<p>Member States shall adopt provisions to ensure the appropriate "
"health surveillance of workers pursuant to Article 14 of Directive "
"89/131/EEC. The directive on optical radiation must be implemented by "
"27 April 2010. It is the last of a series of four directives designed "

"        <p>Outsourcing (or contracting out) may be defined as the "
"delegation of non-core operations or jobs from internal production to "
"an external entity\\n"
"        (such as a subcontractor) that specialises in that operation. "
"Outsourcing can be used for a variety of reasons: to save money, "
"improve quality, or free\\n"
"        up company resources for other activities.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Outsourcing should be distinguished from offshoring. While "
"offshoring describes the relocation of production processes or "
"services from one country\\n"
"        to another, outsourcing is the movement of internal business "
"processes to an external company. Outsourcing occurs when some "
"economic activity ceases to\\n"
"        be performed within the company and is instead purchased from "
"another company. The key issue is whether the company obtains "
"intermediary goods or\\n"
"        services through hierarchical control within a single "
"organisation or through the market.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Outsourcing may be profitable when inputs are standardised, "
"when there are several competing suppliers, if there are economies of "
"scale in the\\n"
"        supply firms that are too large to be duplicated by the buyer, "
"when there are economies of scope that would force the procuring firm "
"into unrelated\\n"
"        business, and when there are no specific investments on the "
"part of either the buyer or seller.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Outsourcing became a popular concept in business and "
"management in the 1990s. Since then, it represents a significant trend "
"in work organisation,\\n"
"        and to some extent the decline in manufacturing employment is "
"due to the reclassification of economic activities that were "
"previously done within a\\n"
"        manufacturing company and which subsequently become outsourced "

"<br /> <p>Pacts for employment and competitiveness (PECs) are <a "
"href=\\collectiveagreementsandworkingconditions.htm\\>collective "
"agreements</a> at organisational or local level that simultaneously "
"deal with employment and competitiveness issues. Normally found in "
"large companies and especially those undergoing <a "
"href=\\restructuring.htm\\>restructuring</a>, they emphasise a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛpartnershipΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά approach in collective "
"bargaining and may cover a wide range of topics to do with work "
"organisation, <a href=\\workingtime.htm\\>working time</a>, "
"productivity, <a href=\\flexibility.htm\\>flexibility</a>, and types "
"and levels of employment. PECs are of interest at European policy "
"level since they arguably offer mechanisms to deal with unemployment "
"and competitiveness through collective bargaining, so fit with "
"concerns about <a href=\\adaptability.htm\\>adaptability</a> and <a "
"href=\\flexicurity.htm\\>flexicurity</a>.</p> <p>Pay bargaining in the "
"1990s in the majority of the EU Member States was strongly influenced "
"by two mutually conflicting and yet closely related constraints: how "
"to reconcile ever higher levels of unemployment with the need for "
"national governments to respect the economic and financial convergence "
"criteria defined in the Maastricht Treaty. In many Member States, "
"social pacts were concluded during this period. These were tripartite "
"agreements providing for wage restraint in exchange for employment "
"policy measures. Wage restraint was usually implemented via central "
"principles governing decentralised wage determination. Unlike these "
"comprehensive social pacts, PECs are bipartite agreements usually in "
"large companies. The governmentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs role is restricted "
"to providing support and encouragement. PECs are prevalent in sectors "
"such as manufacturing, banking and privatised public corporations, "
"where there is pressure to engage in restructuring.</p> <p>PECs seek "
"to support the competitiveness of firms by acting on the cost of "
"labour, on working hours and their flexibility, on internal "
"flexibility and on work organisation, as well as on external work "
"flexibility in, for instance, the case of <a "
"href=\\outsourcing.htm\\>outsourcing</a>. The main objective is to "
"legitimate change while also encouraging workforce cooperation and "
"reducing costs. As regards employment, PECs typically provide for the "
"safeguarding of present employment levels or for the creation of new "
"jobs. In some cases, they also contain more general and indirect "
"provisions concerning corporate strategies, such as pledges to "
"undertake a certain amount of investment or to keep certain production "
"in certain sites. There are also pacts which seek to promote the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛemployabilityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of workers by "
"introducing training and retraining schemes. The majority of pacts are "
"of a ΓΆβ‚¬ΛdefensiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά type, in that they are "
"intended to protect employment rather than create it. Moreover, "
"provisions concerning working hours are more frequent than those "
"concerning pay.</p> <p>PECs also encourage a change in emphasis from "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λdistributive bargainingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά to "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λintegrative bargainingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, including not "
"only trade-offs but also on-going joint monitoring and assessment. "
"Many PECs take the form of <a "
"href=\\frameworkagreements.htm\\>framework agreements</a> , leaving "
"detailed implementation to individual business units within the "
"enterprise or the group of enterprises. Although in most cases such "
"agreements are signed within the national context, there are already "
"some cases in which <a href=\\europeanworkscouncils.htm\\>European "
"Works Councils</a> have signed framework agreements concerning "
"restructuring issues.</p> <p>The negotiation of PECs is bringing about "
"considerable changes in the structure, process and agenda of "
"collective bargaining, with significant effects for sector-level "
"agreements. They contribute to an increasing pressure to change "
"existing labour regulation in order to give more regulatory competence "
"to the company level. Most of the EU Member States have experienced a "
"process of organised decentralisation, whereby many provisions of "
"existing labour law or <a "
"href=\\collectiveagreementsandworkingconditions.htm\\>collective "
"agreements</a> have been given a more flexible implementation at "
"company level. In some EU Member States, the introduction of opening "
"clauses allows for the deviation from norms laid down in collective "
"agreements. This development has favoured the emergence of a new type "
"of agreement that is characterised by the lack of clear trade-offs. In "
"these agreements, concessions with regard to wage levels and working "
"time are laid down without giving in return any guarantees concerning "
"employment levels.</p> <p>If in the 1990s PECs were essentially "
"concerned with the survival of the business or the adaptation to "
"changing market conditions, after 2000 an increasing number of PECs "
"were signed in highly competitive enterprises. That means that PECs "
"are no longer only an instrument for overcoming situations of company "
"crisis, but are increasingly often turning into a strategic instrument "
"in the hands of the management, oriented to improving profitability "
"through the increase in flexibility and the reduction in labour "
"costs.</p> <p>The increased competitiveness of markets and market "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛturbulenceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά are affecting long-term "
"competitiveness and this requires a capacity to adapt and innovate. "
"Collective bargaining may be an important means of obtaining work "
"flexibility in exchange for employment protection and workforce "
"involvement. These requirements favour a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛproactiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά approach and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛpartnershipΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά agreements, seen by some "
"commentators as ΓΆβ‚¬Λone of the most important ways to "
"achieve social change in an increasingly turbulent "
"world,ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and indeed as ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe only "

"Directive 97/81/EC</a> of 15 December 1997).</p> <p>Over the past 25 "
"years, there has been an increase in part-time relative to full-time "
"employment in the EU. In some cases, this is the result of a political "
"decision to promote part-time work, particularly in countries "
"suffering from high unemployment. For workers, it may offer the chance "
"of a better balance between working life and family responsibilities, "
"training, leisure or civic activities. It can also make it easier for "
"workers progressively to enter the labour market or retire from "
"employment. For employers, it can permit not only greater flexibility "
"in responding to market requirements, e.g. by increasing capacity "
"utilisation or extending opening hours, but also productivity gains. "
"For policy-makers confronting high unemployment, the growth of "
"part-time work may reduce the number of jobseekers or, at least, the "
"number of people registered as such.</p> <p>Part-time work also has "
"its drawbacks. Part-time workers are very often at a disadvantage in "
"comparison with colleagues who do equivalent work full time. "
"Typically, their hourly wages are lower; they are ineligible for "
"certain social benefits; and their career prospects are more limited. "
"For employers, in addition to organisational difficulties, there are "
"some fixed costs per worker, e.g. recruitment, training or social "
"security contributions subject to wage ceilings, which may increase "
"overall labour costs if the proportion of work done by part-timers is "

"Directive 97/81/EC</a> of 15 December 1997. Its objective is to lay "
"down ΓΆβ‚¬Λgeneral principles and minimum requirements "
"relating to part-time workΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. It illustrates the "
"willingness of the social partners to establish a general framework "
"for the elimination of discrimination against part-time workers and to "
"assist the development of opportunities for part-time working on a "
"basis acceptable to employers and workers.</p> <p>The Framework "
"Agreement on part-time work takes its place in the wider context of "
"the EU law protecting part-time workers. In view of the predominantly "
"female composition of the part-time workforce in all EU Member States, "
"the principles, purposes, scope, definitions and implementation of the "
"Framework Agreement cannot contravene EU law on sex discrimination, "
"including Treaty provisions, directives and extensive ECJ case "
"law.</p> <p>Discrimination against part-time workers refers to unfair "
"or unequal treatment of those whose normal working week agreed under "
"the contract of employment is shorter than that of full-time "
"employees. In the EU, any treatment of part-time workers which is less "
"favourable than that accorded to full-time workers constitutes "
"indirect <a href=\\discrimination.htm\\>discrimination</a> and "
"violates EU law, unless it can be justified. In Council Directive "
"97/81/EC of 15 December 1997 concerning the Framework Agreement on "
"part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and ETUC (OJ L 14/9 of "
"20.1.98), Clause 4(1) stipulates that there can be no discrimination "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λsolely because they [the workers] work part time, "
"unless different treatment is justified on objective "
"grounds.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά This appears to permit different treatment: "
"i) if working part time is not the sole reason for different "
"treatment; and ii) if working part time is the sole reason for "
"different treatment, it is admissible if it can be "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λjustified on objective grounds.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά This "
"is the second set of ΓΆβ‚¬ΛobjectiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"reasons/grounds; the first is in Clause 2(2) allowing for possible "
"exclusion of casual part-time workers. The prevailing assumption is "
"that the entitlements of part-time workers are calculated on a <i>pro "
"rata</i> basis with full-time workers. However, Clause 4(2) appears to "
"indicate that the <i>pro rata temporis</i> principle may not apply. It "
"only applies ΓΆβ‚¬Λwhere appropriate.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> "
"<p>In order to determine whether there is <a "
"href=\\discrimination.htm\\>discrimination</a> against part-time "
"workers, a comparator, or ΓΆβ‚¬ΛstandardΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"against which such an evaluation can be made, is required. Council "
"Directive 97/81/EC of 15 December 1997 concerning the Framework "
"Agreement on part-time work defines this comparator as one who works "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λin the same establishment, has the same type of "
"employment contract or relationshipΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, and is "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λengaged in the same or a similar work/occupation, due "
"regard being given to other considerations, which may include "
"seniority and qualifications/skillsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>However, "
"these limitations on the scope for comparisons may not be consistent "
"with established EU sex equality law. For example, the <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> has "
"stated that comparisons may be made ΓΆβ‚¬Λin cases in which "
"women and men receive unequal pay for equal work, which is carried out "
"in the same establishment or service...ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (<i>Defrenne "
"v. Sabena (No. 2)</i>), <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;numdoc=61975J0043&amp;lg=en\\>Case "
"43/75</a>, [1976]). The restriction in the Agreement to comparisons "
"with workers ΓΆβ‚¬Λin the same "
"establishmentΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά may, therefore, be overridden where a "
"claim can be based on the more general grounds of sex "
"discrimination.</p> <p>See also: <a href=\\atypicalwork.htm\\>atypical "

"<br /> <p>Pay, the core of the wageΓΆβ‚¬β€work bargain, is "

"href=\\equalpay.htm\\>equal pay</a> for women and men in Article 157 "
"TFEU. The clear commitment by the EU to enforceable regulation as "

"as critical to the common market objective of fair competition, "
"ensuring that employers in some Member States did not benefit from a "
"competitive advantage due to higher regulatory wage standards (in this "
"case, prohibiting discrimination in pay on grounds of sex) in others. "
"For the same reason, the EC Treaty also included a provision that, "

"<br /> <p>The term ΓΆβ‚¬Λportability of supplementary "
"pensionsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά refers to the transferability of "
"occupational pension rights and is particularly important in the "
"context of increasing <a href=\\worker.htm\\>worker</a> mobility, in "
"particular mobility within self-employment. A supplementary pension is "
"a retirement pension provided for in the rules of a supplementary "
"pension scheme established in conformity with national legislation and "
"practice.</p> <p>There is no common framework in the EU regulating the "
"transferability of company pension rights. The difficulty in "
"transferring supplementary occupational pension rights from one "
"country to another has become a serious obstacle to the <a "
"href=\\freemovementofworkers.htm\\>free movement of workers</a> within "
"the EU. The growing importance of supplementary pensions was "
"recognised in a European Commission Green Paper on supplementary "
"pensions of 10 June 1997, following which the Commission published a "
"Communication entitled ΓΆβ‚¬ΛTowards a single market for "
"supplementary pensionsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The significance of "
"supplementary pensions had already been marked by the decision of the "
"<a href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"(ECJ) that occupational pensions constituted "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛpayΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά within the meaning of Article 141 "
"EC (now Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European "
"Union (TFEU)) (<i>Barber v. Guardian Royal Exchange</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61988J0262:EN:HTML\\>Case "
"C-262/88</a>, [1990] ECR I-1889). The potential financial consequences "
"of the decision led to the limitation of its respective effects by the "
"Protocol attached to the Maastricht Treaty (Protocol No. 2, the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛBarberΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Protocol).</p> <p>It is in "
"light of their importance that the issue of portability of "
"supplementary pensions has emerged as a problem. On 28 June 1998, the "
"Council adopted <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31998L0049:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"98/49/EC</a> on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of "
"employed and self-employed persons moving within the Community that "
"ensured the right to <a href=\\equaltreatment.htm\\>equal "
"treatment</a> but did not concern the conditions of acquisition of "
"supplementary pension rights or their transferability. In June 2002, "
"the Commission launched the first consultation of the <a "
"href=\\europeansocialpartners.htm\\>European social partners</a> based "
"on Article 138(2) EC (now Article 154(2) TFEU) on the portability of "
"supplementary pension rights. In its first consultation paper, the "
"Commission explained that there was no Community legislative framework "
"which, in contrast to state pensions, regulated the transfer of "
"acquired company pension rights. This would lead to the undesired "
"consequence that an employee changing employers may be entitled to a "
"pension with the new employer only if he or she fulfils certain "
"criteria, such as waiting periods and minimum age. Since this "
"constituted, in the eyes of the Commission, an infringement on the "
"principle of free movement of workers, an EU-level action was "
"appropriate and proportionate in the sense of the principle of <a "
"href=\\subsidiarity.htm\\>subsidiarity</a>.</p> <p>Both sides of "
"industry responded positively to the first consultation, acknowledging "
"that that there was a need for Community action on the topic in order "
"to improve the portability of occupational pensions and, henceforth, "
"mobility of workers across the European Union. The European social "
"partners did have different views, however, regarding the most "
"adequate instrument to tackle this problem. Against the background of "
"the responses by the EU-level intersectoral and sectoral social "
"partners, the Commission launched a second consultation to the same "
"target audience on 15 September 2003. In its consultation document, "
"the Commission argued strongly in favour of a legal framework being "
"the only appropriate means of assuring minimum requirements to improve "
"the portability of occupational pension rights and, henceforth, "
"mobility of workers across the EU. However, the Commission envisaged a "
"framework agreement between the European social partners as best "
"suiting these needs, since, in application of the principle of <a "
"href=\\horizontalsubsidiarity.htm\\>horizontal subsidiarity</a>, "
"management and labour were the actors closest to the problem, because "
"occupational pension schemes were based on initiatives at the branch "
"or company level.</p> <p>In the course of 2005, the EU-level social "
"partners did not embark on intersectoral negotiations on this issue "
"and this led to the Commission tabling a <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2005:0507:FIN:EN:HTML\\>proposal "
"for a directive</a> on the portability of supplementary pension rights "
"in October of the same year. The general thrust and main objective of "
"the directive was to increase labour mobility across EU boundaries in "
"tackling issues such as the acquisition of supplementary pension "
"rights, the preservation of dormant rights and the transferability of "
"rights. The new draft directive now covers all supplementary pension "
"schemes ΓΆβ‚¬β€ that is, so-called ΓΆβ‚¬Λsecond "
"pillar/occupational schemesΓΆβ‚¬β„ΆΓΆβ‚¬β€ with "
"the exception of those under the scope of EC Regulation 1408/71 on <a "
"href=\\socialsecurity.htm\\>social security</a>.</p> <p>Thus, it "
"applies to supplementary pension schemes existing due to an <a "
"href=\\employmentrelationship.htm\\>employment relationship</a> based "
"on reaching retirement age or on fulfilling other requirements laid "
"down by the scheme or by national legislation. The text of the "
"directive notes that a key objective is to ensure that mobile workers "
"have the opportunity to build up sufficient pension rights by the end "
"of their careers and that failure to achieve this will reduce the <a "
"href=\\flexibility.htm\\>flexibility</a> and effectiveness of the "
"market. The directive covers: the conditions under which an individual "
"acquires pension rights; the conditions under which those rights are "
"treated once an individual has changed jobs; and rights to information "
"on how mobility affects the acquisition and preservation of their "
"supplementary pension rights. The directive specifically sets out the "
"treatment of dormant pension rights of mobile workers.</p> <p>See "

"<br /> <p>A posted worker is defined as ΓΆβ‚¬Λa person who, "

"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0071:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 96/71/EC</a>).</p> <p>The definition, used in several "
"European Institution documents, regulations and research, underlines "
"major characteristics, such as:</p> <ul> <li>a genuine employment "
"relationship with the ΓΆβ‚¬ΛoriginalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"employer;</li> <li>the temporary nature of the activities "
"performed.</li> </ul> <p>Migrant workers are subject to different "
"regulations, as their situation does not correspond to the main "
"criteria of posting. The qualification of posted worker does not apply "
"to:</p> <ul> <li>people who decide of their own accord to seek "
"employment in another Member State;</li> <li>seagoing personnel in the "
"merchant navy;</li> <li>the self-employed.</li> </ul> <p>It should be "
"pointed out that the ΓΆβ‚¬Λfree movement of "
"workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, which gives every citizen the right to move "
"freely to another Member State to work and reside there for that "
"purpose and protects them against discrimination, has to be "
"differentiated from the ΓΆβ‚¬Λfreedom to provide "
"servicesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά that gives businesses the right to provide "
"services in another member state. This is laid out in Article 56 of "
"the <a href=\\treatyonthefunctioningoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Treaty on "
"the Functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU).</p> <p>It is "
"difficult to know exactly who is posted, and how many workers are "
"posted. Calculations are particularly complicated as there are "
"significant differences in how figures are compiled depending on "
"sectors, occupations, sources of data and countries.</p> <p>Posted "
"worker arrangements are common in the construction industry, but are "
"also found in transport, telecommunications, entertainment, repairs, "
"maintenance and servicing. While it is difficult to calculate the "
"precise number of posted workers, data from a European "
"Commission-funded <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=6678&amp;langId=en\\>report "
"(1.96Mb PDF)</a> issued in 2011 found that, based on E101 forms, there "
"were 1,294,669 posted workers in the EU27 countries in 2007. These "
"included postings to a specific country and applications to work in "
"the EU. However, posted workers represented only 0.37% of the active "
"population of EU-15 ΓΆβ‚¬Λsending countriesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"(countries which are posting abroad) and 0.74% of the active "
"population of EU-12 sending countries. The main sending countries were "
"France, Poland and Germany.</p> <p>The issues at stake when it comes "
"to posted workers are, on the one hand, workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"rights and, on the other hand, company freedom and obligations. The "
"Rome Convention of 19 June 1980 held that, whichever law applies, the "
"worker should not be deprived of the protection afforded by mandatory "
"rules of law applicable in the host country. This authorised Member "
"States to require posting enterprises to respect local legislation and "
"collective agreements.</p> <h3>The 1996 Directive</h3> <p>In 1996, the "
"Council adopted a Directive aimed at addressing the challenge for "
"balancing the workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and "
"companiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά rights ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0071:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 96/71/EC</a> on the posting of workers is the framework of "
"the provision of services. The aim of the 1996 Directive was to remove "
"the uncertainties and obstacles impeding the free provision of "
"services by increasing legal certainty and facilitating the definition "
"of <a href=\\workingconditions.htm\\>working conditions</a> "
"regulations applicable to posted workers. In this way, it hoped to "
"avoid the risk of posted workers being misused or exploited.</p> "
"<p>The Directive goes a step further than the 1980 Rome Convention, by "
"making posting enterprisesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά obligations a requirement "
"of EU law. Article 3(1) provides that ΓΆβ‚¬ΛMember States "
"shall ensure that... undertakings... guarantee workers posted to their "
"territoryΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά minimum standards of employment conditions "
"that prevail in the posted worker country. The terms and conditions "
"covered by the Directive include:</p> <ul> <li>maximum work periods "
"and minimum <a href=\\restperiods.htm\\>rest periods</a>;</li> "
"<li>maximum paid <a href=\\annualleave.htm\\>annual leave</a>;</li> "

"<h3>Discussing the issues</h3> <p>Implementation of the Posting of "
"Workers Directive has been a matter of much discussion.</p> <p>In "
"2006, the Commission published a set of guidelines to help "
"governments, enterprises and employees better understand the "
"applicability of the directive. Concerned that the minimum standards "
"outlined in the directive were not being fully complied with, the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 2006 Communication underlined control "
"measures to improve the application of the directive.</p> <p>The "
"Commission, however, was conscious that such control mechanisms should "
"not impinge on Article 56 of the TFEU governing "
"companiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά provision of cross-border services. Citing "
"<a href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"(ECJ) rulings, the Commission notes, ΓΆβ‚¬Λinspections must "
"be suitable for achieving the objectives pursued without restricting "
"this freedom any more than necessary, in accordance with the principle "
"of proportionalityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>In October 2006, the "

"application of the directive in Member States. The findings, announced "
"in a Communication of June 2007 (<a "

"304 final) (65Kb PDF)</a>), reveal that control mechanisms continue to "
"be quite limited. The problem of the posted worker concerns the "
"conditions of work applicable to these employees. Are they those of "
"the home country of the enterprise (and worker), or those of the host "
"country where the work is performed? There is a risk that foreign "
"businesses could undermine local <a "
"href=\\labourstandards.htm\\>labour standards</a> by applying lower "
"home country conditions in countries where standards were higher. In "
"the past few years, there has been renewed focus at EU level on the "
"issue of posted workers. The issue has been highlighted by judgements "

"cases.</p> <p>In these cases, the ECJ essentially ruled that the EU "
"principles governing the free movement of goods and services, the "
"freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide cross-border "
"services should not be impeded by industrial action aiming to ensure "
"that posted workers receive collectively-agreed terms and conditions "
"and the inclusion of collectively-agreed terms in procurement "
"contracts.</p> <p>In the Laval case, for example, the ECJ held that "
"the right to strike could represent a restriction on the freedom to "
"provide services. The ruling stated a strike could only be conducted "
"under EU law where it was to pursue a legitimate aim and was justified "
"by overriding reasons of public interest. The ECJ noted that while "
"Article 3 of the Posted Workers Directive gave a right to minimum "
"terms and conditions to posted workers, these rights had to have been "
"underpinned either by law or universally applicable collective "
"agreements. The absence of either provision meant that posted workers "
"had no right to be paid the rate established by the collective "

"shows, the discussion has mainly been at European level. Only in a few "
"countries, including the ones directly concerned by the ECJ rulings, "
"has action been taken by governments and social partner "
"organisations.</p> <p>The Council has never debated the consequences "
"of the ECJ rulings for posting in either an informal or institutional "
"framework. However, on several occasions government representatives "
"have commented on the rulings. No explicit demand has yet been "
"formulated for reopening the Directive 96/71 as a consequence of the "
"rulings. Furthermore, individual Member States directly or indirectly "
"affected by the rulings ΓΆβ‚¬β€ including Denmark, Sweden, "
"Luxembourg and Germany ΓΆβ‚¬β€ have reacted by amending "
"their own legislation. They have brought their laws in line with the "
"rulings.</p> <p>Debates about the issues raised by the implementation "
"of the Directive have also taken place in the European Parliament "
"which has adopted several resolutions. The last one was adopted in "
"2008 after intense internal debate. It calls on the Commission to "
"continue examining the implementation, correct application and "
"enforcement of the Directive and suggests that this should not exclude "
"a partial revision of the Directive after assessing in depth the "
"problems with its implementation, and propose modifications, if "
"appropriate.</p> <p>In 2010, the <a "
"href=\\europeaneconomicandsocialcommittee.htm\\>European Economic and "
"Social Committee</a> adopted an Opinion on the Social Dimension of the "
"Single Market asking for a more effective implementation of the "
"Directive 96/71. It also expressed support for a Commission initiative "
"to clarify the legal obligations for national authorities, business "
"and workers, including a partial revision of the Directive. The "
"opinion further encourages the Commission to exempt the right to "
"strike from the internal market and to explore the idea of a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEuropean Social InterpolΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, supporting "
"the activities of labour inspectorates of the various Member "
"States.</p> <p>The European Commission has undertaken a number of "
"initiatives in recent times to address some of the problems caused by "
"the way in which the existing legislation is implemented, applied and "
"enforced. An important initiative is the <a "

"release</a> describes how the commission was working to cut red tape "
"for the service sector while guaranteeing the protection of posted "
"workers.</p> <p>The rulings were critically received by the European "
"Trade Union Confederation (<a href=\\etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>) and trade "
"unions in general. They called them a ΓΆβ‚¬Λlicence for "
"social dumpingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. They criticised what they perceived "
"as too narrow an interpretation of the Directive, which they felt left "
"little room for host Member States or social partners to improve the "
"scope and/or the level of employment conditions of posted workers.</p> "
"<p>They were keen to clarify the role of trade unions in defending "
"workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά rights in cross-border situations. They "
"asked for an urgent revision of the Posting of Workers Directive and "
"the introduction of a ΓΆβ‚¬Λsocial progress clause/Monti "

"ProtocolΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά with the aim of giving priority to "
"fundamental social rights over economic freedoms.</p> <p>On the other "
"hand <a href=\\businesseurope.htm\\>BusinessEurope</a> and employer "
"organisations welcomed the court rulings. They see them as an "
"important contribution to the clarification of the legislation and the "
"consolidation of the Single Market.</p> <p>On a joint invitation by "
"the Commission and the French Presidency of the EU, the European "
"Social partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά organisations ΓΆβ‚¬β€ "
"Business Europe, <a href=\\ceep.htm\\>CEEP</a>, <a "
"href=\\ueapme.htm\\>UEAPME</a> and ETUC ΓΆβ‚¬β€ delivered a "
"report on the consequences of the ECJ rulings in the Viking, Laval, "
"RΓƒΒΌffert and Luxembourg cases for workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"mobility and workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά rights. The document, adopted "
"on 19 March 2010, while expressing a number of common concerns and "
"objectives, exposed their divergences on the fundamentals.</p> <p>They "
"agreed that the most relevant points for their reflection were:</p> "
"<ul> <li>the context of the single market and impact of ECJ "
"rulings;</li> <li>the relationships between economic freedoms and "
"fundamental social rights;</li> <li>the challenge of respecting the "
"diversity of industrial relations systems and models;</li> "
"<li>responses to the challenges raised by the judgements.</li> </ul> "
"<p>The report comprised:</p> <ul> <li>the shared observations of "
"European employers and trade unions;</li> <li>two separate "
"contributions from employers and trade unions following the same "
"structure and addressing the most relevant points for reflection;</li> "
"<li>some final remarks by the European social partners.</li> </ul> "
"<p>In the report, while stressing some points of agreement, the social "
"partners highlighted some controversial issues. The report says:</p> "
"<p><i>The Posting of Workers Directive provides for minimum standards "
"which must be observed to ensure respect for the rights of workers and "
"a climate of fair competition. Although the European social partners "
"agree on this, they have different views on whether these aims are "
"achieved by the Posting of Workers Directive following its "
"interpretation by the European Court of Justice. Whilst both sides "
"recognise the need to compel service providers to comply with a "
"nucleus of rules as defined in the host country, they disagree on the "
"definition of this nucleus as well as on the possibility for trade "
"unions and/or Member States in the host country to go beyond this "
"nucleus of rules.</i></p> <p><i>The diversity of industrial relations "
"systems should be respected. In line with the subsidiarity principle, "
"working conditions are and should continue to be determined primarily "
"according to the national rules applicable to a given market, as laid "
"down in national law, collective agreements or practices, taking into "
"account European laws and regulations regarding minimum "
"standards.</i></p> <h3>More recent discussions</h3> <p>At the "
"presentation of his political priorities before the European "
"Parliament on 15 September 2009, President JosΓƒΒ© Manuel Barroso "
"said he recognised the need to address the concerns and issues raised "
"about posted workers. He announced a legislative initiative to resolve "
"the problems of implementation and interpretation of the posting of "
"workers Directive 1996/71. The President was responding to claims by "
"several MEPs and the trade unions that a revision of the Directive was "
"needed in order to reverse the ECJ rulings Viking, Laval, "
"RΓƒΒΌffert and Commission vs Luxembourg.</p> <p>On 21 March 2012, "
"the Commission issued proposals for new rules governing the posting of "
"workers in Europe (<a "
"href=\\/eiro/2012/04/articles/eu1204011i.htm\\><b>EU1204011I</b></a>). "
"The aim is to increase protection for posted workers and to clarify "
"the debate around the primacy of freedom to provide services and "
"employment rights that has resulted from ECJ case law.</p> <p>Its "
"proposal for a <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=7479&amp;langId=en\\>Directive "
"on the enforcement of Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of "
"workers in the framework of the provision of services (240Kb PDF)</a> "
"aims to reconcile the exercise of the freedom to provide cross-border "
"services under Article 56 TFEU with appropriate protection of the "
"rights of workers temporarily posted abroad for that purpose.</p> "
"<p>Most specifically the objectives are to:</p> <ul> <li>set more "
"ambitious standards to inform workers and companies about their rights "
"and obligations (Article 5);</li> <li>establish clear rules for "
"cooperation between national authorities in charge of posting (Article "
"6);</li> <li>provide elements to improve the implementation and "
"monitoring of the notion of posting to avoid the multiplication of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λletter-boxΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά companies that use posting "
"as a way to circumvent employment rules (Article 3);</li> <li>define "
"the supervisory scope and responsibilities of relevant national "
"authorities (Article 7);</li> <li>improve the enforcement of "
"workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά rights, including the introduction of <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2008/94/en/1/EF0894EN.pdf\\>joint "
"and several liability (261Kb PDF)</a> for the construction sector for "
"the wages of posted workers as well as the handling of complaints "
"(Article 12).</li> </ul> <p>In addition, to address the issue of "
"industrial actions, a specific regulation is foreseen; the so-called "
"Monti II Regulation. The <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=7480&amp;langId=en\\>Regulation "
"on the exercise of the right to take collective action within the "
"context of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide "
"services (80Kb PDF)</a> addresses concerns raised by some "
"interpretations of the ECJ rulings.</p> <p>There are risks that in the "
"single market, economic freedoms would prevail over the right to "
"strike. It stresses that there is no primacy between the right to take "
"collective action and the freedom to provide services (Article 2). In "
"the case of disputes at EU level resulting from the exercise of the "
"right to collective action, including the right or freedom to strike, "
"in transnational situations or situations with a cross-border "
"character, the proposal provides for the possibility of non-judicial "
"settlements. It also sets out a new alert mechanism for industrial "
"conflicts in cross-border situations with severe implications (Article "
"4).</p> <h3>Social partner reaction</h3> <p>The European social "
"partners commented extensively on the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"ideas.</p> <p>BusinessEurope said in a press release on 21 March 2012 "
"that the Commission proposals undermined the development of the single "
"market. It said European companies were concerned that the Commission "
"has proposed EU legislation which companies would have great "
"difficulties in applying. It added that developing the single market "
"will not happen if companies operating across borders are obliged to "
"fulfil costly administrative requirements.</p> <p>Bernadette "
"SΓƒΒ©gol, ETUC General Secretary, said in a <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/a/9823\\>statement</a> she could not "
"support a regulation that undermined the right to strike, adding: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe right to take collective action is a fundamental "
"right which must be guaranteed.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Although ETUC "
"welcomed measures to improve the implementation of the Posting of "
"Workers Directive, it considered that the new enforcement directive "
"was too weak, in particular regarding the possibility to hold a "
"contractor liable.</p> <p>In April 2012, ETUC made a <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/a/9917\\>declaration</a> on the Commission "
"proposals for a Monti II Regulation and the Enforcement Directive of "
"the Posting of Workers Directive.</p> <p>The declaration says:</p> "
"<p><i>The Commission package on the posting of workers adopted on 21 "
"March 2012 does not strike the right balance between protecting "
"workers and facilitating cross-border service provision. The ETUC "
"rejects the proposal for a Monti II Regulation and calls on the "
"Commission to revise the Posting of Workers Directive.</i></p> <p>Then "
"in June 2012, ETUC published its own <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/a/10037\\>position paper</a> on the issue, "
"setting out key demands regarding the Enforcement Directive.</p> <p>In "
"2011 and 2012, several discussions were organised on the posting of "
"workers issues, involving several MEPs, political parties and social "
"partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά representatives.</p> <p><b>See also: "

"<br /> <p>The preliminary reference procedure is used when a national "
"court or tribunal refers a question of EU law to the <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"(ECJ) for a preliminary ruling so as to enable the national court, on "
"receiving that ruling, to decide the case before it. Questions of EU "
"law will arise in cases before the courts of different Member States. "
"The function of the preliminary reference procedure is to ensure "
"uniform interpretation and validity of EU law across all the Member "
"States.</p> <p>The procedure is laid down in Article 267 TFEU: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛWhere such a question is raised before any court or "
"tribunal of a Member State, that court may, if it considers that a "
"decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, "
"require the Court of Justice to give a ruling "
"thereon.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>While lower courts have discretion "
"as to whether to make references to the ECJ, Article 267 TFEU excludes "
"such discretion in the case of final courts of appeal.</p> <p>The ECJ "
"characterises the preliminary reference procedure as based on "
"cooperation between national courts and the ECJ. However, it is the "
"ECJ that controls this cooperation and sets its terms. In its "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛdialogueΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά with national courts, it has "
"the upper hand and has succeeded in co-opting national courts into an "
"EU judicial system.</p> <p>In practice, labour courts in the Member "
"States have differed greatly in the use made of the preliminary "
"reference procedure. Despite the uniform requirements of Article 267 "
"TFEU, the number of references made by <a href=\\n"
"ationallabourcourts.htm\\>national labour courts</a> in different "
"Member States varies considerably.</p> <p>The ECJ has been sensitive "
"to the charge of usurping the role of national courts in deciding "
"cases. However, the technique adopted by the Court is problematic. The "
"ECJ aims to lay down EU law principles, but leaves the application of "
"these principles to national courts. The boundaries are often unclear. "
"A principle may be defined in terms that leave little or no discretion "
"to national courts; or the principle may be defined so vaguely as to "
"provide the national court with little in the way of useful guidance. "
"Cases involving EU law on employment and industrial relations provide "
"illustrations. For example, the European Court has laid down the "
"principle that indirect discrimination is justifiable on objective "
"grounds, which must, however, comply with the general principle of "
"proportionality ΓΆβ‚¬β€ but both objective grounds and "
"proportionality are to be left for national courts to decide "

"<br /> <p>The TFEU guarantees the right to free movement not only of "

"be clearly that of a worker or a person supplying services or seeking "
"the right of establishment, but the Treaty and the Court have sought "
"to extend the same freedoms equally to all three categories of "
"economic activity. With specific regard to the latter categories, it "

"the number of votes allocated to the then acceding countries was "
"decided at Nice. The objective was to ensure that the relative weight "
"of small and medium-sized countries is in proportion to their "
"populations and, in part, to compensate the large Member States for "
"their loss of a second Commissioner. The post-accession weighting was "
"laid down in a Protocol to the Treaty of Nice, which envisaged "

"at 258 out of 345 (74.8%). The Treaty of Nice also amended the formula "
"constituting a qualified majority. Currently, this must satisfy two "
"conditions: a set number of votes and agreement by a majority of "
"Member States. Further, a Member State may request that the qualified "
"majority represents at least 62% of the total population of the Union. "
"If not, the decision is not adopted. The Treaty of Lisbon again "
"changed these rules for qualified majority voting. The present system "
"will continue until November 2014. From then on, the definition of the "
"qualified majority will be different. It will be a double majority so "
"that, in order to be adopted, an act must have the support of at least "
"55 % of the EU Member States (i.e. 15 Member States in a Union of 27) "
"and at least 65 % of the population of the EU. A blocking minority "
"must include at least four Member States. However, between November "
"2014 and March 2017, any Member State may request that the current "
"weighted voting system be applied instead of the new double majority "
"system (Articles 16(3-5) TEU) and 238(4) TFEU). It is the voting "
"procedures in the Council of Ministers which will largely determine "
"the evolution of EU policy in the fields of employment and industrial "
"relations.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"Directive 2000/43</a> which implements the principle of <a "

"and involvement in organisations of workers or employers and "

"<br /> <p><a href=\\eulaw.htm\\>EU law</a> has not provided for "

"(ECJ) has no opportunity to develop such remedies since it cannot "

"law have been violated. Instead, minimum standards for remedies to be "
"provided by national courts have been developed through the requests "
"by national courts for preliminary rulings under Article 267 TFEU.</p> "
"<p>Different national legal systems provide a variety of remedies for "
"infringements of laws in the field of employment and industrial "
"relations. While the ECJ has recognised the necessity for <a "
"href=\\enforcementofeulaw.htm\\>enforcement of EU law</a> in national "
"courts, it has insisted that national labour courts exert themselves "
"to enforce EU law. The ECJ has attempted to maintain equilibrium "
"between the autonomy of national systems to enforce EU law and the "
"imperative of effective and uniform enforcement of EU law across all "
"Member States. Referring to the third paragraph of Article 288TFEU, "
"the Court held: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛAlthough that provision leaves Member "
"States to choose the ways and means of ensuring that the directive is "
"implemented, that freedom does not affect the obligation imposed on "

"14/83</a>).</p> <p>The ECJ has moved in the direction of scrutinising "
"national systems of judicial protection of EU rights by laying down "
"some general principles regarding the adequacy of national laws on "
"remedies. These include the principle of equivalence of EU law "
"remedies to national remedies, and the requirement that <a "
"href=\\remediesforinfringementsofeulaw.htm\\>remedies for "
"infringements of EU law</a> be effective. National autonomy as regards "

"example, the adequacy of financial <a "
"href=\\compensation.htm\\>compensation</a> as a remedy for breach of "
"EU rights in employment and industrial relations is questionable. "
"Particularly in the case of the exercise of collective rights, such as "
"information and consultation, it may be that the award of compensation "
"to employees affected by the employersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά failure to "
"inform or consult employee representatives is insufficient to achieve "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λreal and effective judicial protection and have a real "

"left to national law, but EU law requires this choice to be "

"the subject of litigation before the European Court of First Instance "
"(CFI). The CFI asserted that agreements reached through the social "
"dialogue ΓΆβ‚¬β€ which are then incorporated into "
"directives ΓΆβ‚¬β€ may be challenged on grounds of their "
"democratic legitimacy. CFI deemed this necessary, since the Directive "
"was not subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament. Since this "
"ruling, it has been the legal responsibility of the European "
"Commission to scrutinise to identify the European social partners who "
"are eligible to engage in European social dialogue.</p> <p>In 2006 the "

"<h3>Methodology of representativeness studies</h3> <p>The first step "
"in each representativeness study is a discussion with the relevant "
"sectoral actors at European level, to agree on the definition of the "
"sector to be studied. The introductory chapter of each study provides "
"details of the given sector definition, in terms of the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛStatistical classification of economic activities in "
"the European CommunityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (<i>Nomenclature statistique "
"des</i></p> <p><i>activitΓƒΒ©s ΓƒΒ©conomiques dans la "
"CommunautΓƒΒ© europΓƒΒ©enne</i>, NACE) to ensure that the "
"findings can be compared cross-nationally.</p> <p>Data at national "
"level is collected by EurofoundΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 27 <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/contact.htm\\>EIRO national "
"correspondents</a> on the basis of a questionnaire. Representatives of "
"sectoral social partners ΓΆβ‚¬β€ at both European and "
"national level ΓΆβ‚¬β€ are consulted and required to "
"comment on the information and data collected by the EIRO national "
"correspondents during the preparation of the national and overview "
"reports.</p> <h3>Which organisations are included in the studies?</h3> "
"<p>A <b>European association</b> is deemed to be a sector-related "
"social partner, if</p> <ul> <li>it is on the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬Λs list of social partner organisations "
"consulted on behalf of the sector under article 154 TFEU;</li> "
"<li>and/or if it participates in the sector-related European social "
"dialogue;</li> <li>or it has requested to be consulted by the EC under "
"article 154 TFEU.</li> </ul> <p>The representativeness of European "
"level sectoral associations is assessed against the number and "
"characteristics of their members at national level.</p> <p>Therefore, "
"a <b>national association</b> is included in the studies if</p> <ul> "
"<li>it relates to the sector (in one of the four ways indicated "
"below);</li> <li>and is either regularly involved in collective "
"bargaining at national/sectoral level;</li> <li>and/or is affiliated "
"to any relevant European social partner organisation.</li> </ul> "
"<h3>Defining relationship to the sector</h3> <p>The studies therefore "
"analyse all national trade unions, employer organisations and "
"multi-employer collective agreements that are sector-related in terms "
"of any of the following four aspects or patterns:</p> <ul> "
"<li>congruence ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the domain of the organisation or "
"scope of the collective agreement must be identical to the NACE "
"demarcation;</li> <li>sectionalism ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the domain or "
"scope covers only a certain part of the sector, as defined by the NACE "
"demarcation, while no group outside the sector is covered;</li> "
"<li>overlap ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the domain or scope covers the entire "
"sector, along with parts of one or more other sectors. Studies do not "
"include general associations that do not deal with sector-specific "
"matters;</li> <li>sectional overlap ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the domain or "
"scope covers part of the given sector, as well as parts of one or more "

"2000/34</a> of 22 June 2000) provides for:</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>a minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours a "
"day;</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>a rest break where the working day is longer than six "
"hours;</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>a minimum rest period of one day a week.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <h3>Daily rest periods</h3>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The stipulation of a minimum 11 hours of rest in a 24-hour "
"period implies potentially a lawful 13 hour working day. However, this "
"is unlikely to be\\n"
"        allowed by reason of other provisions of the directive.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>First, the imposition of a minimum 11 hours of rest "
"(implying a maximum working day of 13 hours) is supplemented by a "
"general provision, which\\n"
"        reads: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛMember States shall take the measures "
"necessary to ensure that an employer who intends to organise work "
"according to a certain pattern takes\\n"
"        account of the general principle of adapting work to the "
"worker, with a view, in particular, to alleviating monotonous work and "
"work at a predetermined\\n"
"        work-rate, depending on the type of activity, and of safety "
"and health requirements, especially as regards breaks during working "
"timeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>This principle of the ΓΆβ‚¬Λhumanisation of "
"workΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and the emphasis in Scandinavian countries on "
"the psychological and social drawbacks of working time,\\n"
"        such as monotony, lack of social contacts at work or a rapid "
"work pace, were the inspiration for the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"proposal on working time regulation\\n"
"        and here receive explicit recognition. Breaks at work are not "
"aimed solely at avoiding dangers to health and safety: they are to be "
"integrated as a\\n"
"        means of humanising work patterns.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The requirement in the directive for rest periods during "
"working hours effectively reduces the maximum 13-hour working day by "
"the amount of the rest\\n"
"        periods. It is unclear whether daily breaks for rest count "
"towards daily working hours within the meaning of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λworking timeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά as defined in Article "
"2(1)\\n"
"        of the directive. But whether the duration of the working day "
"includes rest periods or not, it cannot be prolonged beyond 13 hours, "
"as this would\\n"
"        violate the requirement of 11 consecutive hours of "
"rest.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The minimum EU standard for the duration of the working day "
"is, therefore, 11 consecutive hours of rest, and a maximum 13 hours of "
"work punctuated\\n"
"        by at least one long break, or two or more shorter breaks, the "
"intervals being not more than six hours apart. In any case, a working "
"time regime which\\n"
"        opted for such a long working day would be constrained by the "
"provisions on maximum hours in a working week.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <h3>Rest breaks</h3>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The Working Time Directive allows for collective agreements "
"to fix or define relevant standards of rest breaks during working "
"hours. The directive\\n"
"        gives priority to collective agreements over legislation in "
"determining the EU standard. The EU standard is to be determined by "
"collective bargaining\\n"
"        (though without specifying the appropriate level) and, only in "
"its absence, by legislation.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The duration of rest breaks is not indicated, but certain "
"criteria may be expected to emerge following precedents involving the "
"balancing of\\n"
"        employer and worker interests in the EC law on indirect sex "
"discrimination (see <i>Bilka-Kaufhaus GmbH v. Karin Weber von "
"Hartz</i>, <a href=\\n"
"        "
"\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61984J0170:EN:HTML\\>Case "
"170/84</a>[1986]). These criteria might require that the duration\\n"
"        of the rest period responds to the human needs of the worker, "
"and is appropriate, having regard to the length of the preceding and "
"subsequent work\\n"
"        periods. The criteria take into account all the different "
"possibilities of organising the working time of the workforce as a "
"whole so as to provide\\n"
"        adequate rest periods for all workers.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The directive obliges employers ΓΆβ‚¬Λwho intend "
"to organise work according to a certain pattern take account of the "
"general principle of adapting work\\n"
"        to the worker... especially as regards breaks during working "
"timeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Member States must require employers to "
"organise working time taking into account\\n"
"        this principle of the humanisation of work. If it can be shown "
"that an organisation of working time, including work breaks, would "
"ameliorate these\\n"
"        problems, it is arguable that the employer has at least to "
"justify not introducing them. Daily rest breaks, which do not respond "
"to the workerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs human\\n"
"        needs and which the employer cannot justify, violate the EC "
"standard. Member State legislation which does not secure that such "
"rest breaks are provided\\n"
"        would arguably be in violation of the duty to implement the "
"directiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs requirements, and state liability might "
"be imposed to compensate the workers\\n"
"        affected (<i>Francovich and Bonfaci v. Italian Republic</i>, "
"<a href=\\n"
"        "
"\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61990J0006:EN:HTML\\>Cases "
"6/90 and 9/90</a> [1992]).</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <h3>Weekly rest periods</h3>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The Working Time Directive stipulates a standard of weekly "
"rest in Article 5: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛMember States shall take the "
"measures necessary to ensure that, per\\n"
"        each seven-day period, every worker is entitled to a minimum "
"uninterrupted rest period of 24 hours plus the 11 "
"hoursΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά daily rest referred to in Article\\n"
"        3ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The weekly rest period must follow on "
"from one of the 11 hour daily rest periods, so as to constitute a "
"continuous break of 35 hours at least once\\n"
"        a week, averaged over more than 14 days.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>There is an ambiguous provision tacked on to the end of "
"Article 5: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛIf objective, technical or work organisation "
"conditions so justify, a minimum\\n"
"        rest period of 24 hours may be appliedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The "
"meaning of this exception is not clear. There are two possibilities. "
"Each eliminates one of the\\n"
"        qualifications attached to the provision in the first "
"paragraph: either, that 24 hours be added to the 11 hours of daily "
"rest; or that the 24 hours be\\n"
"        without interruption. Most likely, it refers to the "
"requirement that the 24 hour weekly rest period be connected to a "
"previous 11 hour rest period, so\\n"
"        as to constitute a solid block of 35 hours rest per week. "
"Apparently, a minimal 24 hour period may be justified in some "
"circumstances. The only other\\n"
"        possibility would seem to be that the provision for a 24 hour "
"rest period is not to be a consecutive period, but is to be added to "
"the 11 hours minimum\\n"
"        daily rest and distributed throughout the week, so that there "
"is no consecutive 24 hour period.</p>\\n"

"<ul> <li>Relocation: when the activity stays within the same company, "
"but is moved to another location within the same country. This differs "
"from outsourcing in so far as the activities which are transferred do "
"not belong to an ΓΆβ‚¬Λintegrated systemΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of "
"a broader production ΓΆβ‚¬β€ in other words, are not part "
"of the supply chain.</li> <li><a "
"href=\\outsourcing.htm\\>Outsourcing</a>: when the activity is "
"subcontracted or contracted out to another company within the same "
"country. It is the act of transferring some of the "
"companyΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs recurring internal activities and powers of "
"decision to outside providers.</li> <li>Offshoring/delocalisation: "
"when the activity is relocated or outsourced outside of the "
"countryΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs borders. The offshored activity may either "
"continue to be owned by the company or may be offshore "
"outsourced.</li> <li>Bankruptcy/closure: when an industrial site is "
"closed or a company goes bankrupt for economic reasons not directly "
"connected to relocation or outsourcing.</li> <li>Merger/acquisition: "
"when two or more companies decide to transfer their assets into a "
"single company or during an acquisition which then involves an "
"internal restructuring programme aimed at rationalising the "
"organisation by cutting personnel.</li> <li>Internal restructuring: "
"when a company undertakes a job-cutting plan which is not linked to "
"another type of restructuring defined above.</li> <li>Business "
"expansion: when a company extends its business activities, hiring new "
"workforce.</li> <li>Other: when a company undergoes a type of "
"restructuring that is not one of the above types.</li> </ul> <p>The "
"issue of restructuring has become increasingly prominent with the "

"Parliament</a>, pushed the Commission to propose a new initiative to "

"January 2011 to re-launch a <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=89&amp;newsId=1166&amp;furtherNews=yes\\>general "

"Restructuring in Europe 2011 (2.8Mb PDF)</a> that gave an in-depth "
"overview of the different aspects of the CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"policy on restructuring. With this Green Paper, the Commission wanted "
"to:</p> <p><i>...encourage permanent business adaptation to "
"fast-changing economic circumstances while pursuing a high level of "
"employment and social protection through the appropriate supporting "
"measures.</i></p> <p>It ΓΆβ‚¬ΛstronglyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"recommended measures supporting the reallocation of resources between "
"firms and sectors.</p> <p>The Commission said it regretted that "
"practices in this field were:</p> <p><i>...sometimes reactive rather "
"than anticipative and proactive; they can happen too late in the "
"decision-making process and may not involve external entities early "
"enough for them to play a role in attenuating the social impact of "
"restructuring.</i></p> <p>Restructuring remains a live issue in "
"Europe. In January 2013, the European Parliament endorsed a report "
"drawn up by Spanish socialist member Alejandro Cercas (<a "
"href=\\/eiro/2013/01/articles/eu1301021i.htm\\><b>EU1301021I</b></a>). "
"His report called on the European Commission to submit a proposal for "
"a legal act on anticipation and management of change and restructuring "
"and for the Commission to consult with the social partners before "
"coming back with its proposal.</p> <p>The "
"ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs text covers rules on the long-term "
"strategic anticipation of employment and skills needs, early "
"preparation of restructuring operations and management of concrete "
"restructuring processes. It contains 14 recommendations that cover "
"such aspects as:</p> <ul> <li>long-term strategic planning;</li> "
"<li>adaptability and employability;</li> <li>anticipation of "
"employment and skills needs;</li> <li>early preparation;</li> "
"<li>information and consultation concerning business decisions;</li> "
"<li>agreements on managing restructuring processes;</li> "
"<li>minimising external economic and social and environmental "
"impacts;</li> <li>public support;</li> <li>financial support;</li> "
"<li>designation of the relevant public authorities.</li> </ul> <p>The "
"ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs report was welcomed by the European "
"Trade Union Confederation (<a href=\\etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>). There was "
"no official reaction from the employersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά organisation "
"BusinessEurope, but its overall view is that there is no need for an "
"EU-level instrument to manage restructuring.</p> "
"<p>LΓƒΒ΅szlΓƒΒ³ Andor, European Commissioner for Employment, "
"Social Affairs and Inclusion, welcomed the initiative. However, the "
"Commissioner reminded the MEPs that:</p> <p><i>...even before new "
"policies or new instruments are developed, what is crucial at this "
"stage is the implementation of applicable EU law, particularly as "
"concerns the information and consultation of workers.</i></p> <p>He "
"outlined the situation regarding follow-up to the "
"ParliamentΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs report:</p> <p><i>The Commission is "
"working on the appropriate follow-up to the consultation it carried "
"out on the basis of the [2011] Green Paper on restructuring. This "

"<br /> <p>Article 28 of the <a "
"href=\\charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter of "
"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>, entitled "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛRight of collective bargaining and "
"actionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, stipulates:</p> <p><i>Workers and employers, "
"or their respective organisations, have, in accordance with Union law "
"and national laws and practices, the right to negotiate and conclude "
"collective agreements at the appropriate levels and, in cases of "
"conflicts of interests, to take collective action to defend their "
"interests, including strike action.</i></p> <p>The right of <a "
"href=\\collectivebargaining.htm\\>collective bargaining</a> enshrined "
"in Article 28 stems from Article 6 of the <a "
"href=\\europeansocialcharter.htm\\>European Social Charter</a> "
"1961ΓΆβ‚¬β€1996 and Article 12 of the <a "
"href=\\communitycharterofthefundamentalsocialrightsofworkers.htm\\>Community "
"Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers</a> of 1989. Other "
"international instruments also provide for this right, such as "
"International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 98 of 1949 on "
"the application of the principles of the right to organise and to "
"bargain collectively.</p> <p>Explicit rights to collective labour "
"negotiation are to be found in the constitutions of some Member "
"States, but otherwise rights of collective bargaining are said to "
"derive from the broad right of association. In providing for a right "
"of collective bargaining, the EU Charter may influence different "
"constitutional texts and have a substantive impact on national legal "
"systems without such rights at a constitutional level. Whatever the "
"constitutional position, the development of collective bargaining in "
"all Member States has produced legal rules regulating collective "
"bargaining and collective agreements, and these will be affected by "
"the fundamental right in the EU Charter.</p> <p>Article 28 deals with "
"the process of collective bargaining, its outcome, the collective "
"agreement, the actors involved (workers, employers, their "
"organisations) and the ΓΆβ‚¬ΛappropriateΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"levels. Article 28 describes the ΓΆβ‚¬Λright of collective "
"bargainingΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά as a completed process of two phases: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λto negotiate and conclude collective "
"agreementsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά ΓΆβ‚¬β€ in short, all the "
"steps from initiating negotiations to concluding the collective "
"agreement, including the actual negotiations. The European Social "
"Charter (1961, revised 1996) describes the content of the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λright to bargain collectivelyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"(Article 6) by listing the obligations to be undertaken by states "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λwith a view to ensuring [its] effective "
"exerciseΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά including active promotion. These may be "
"taken as indicators of the minimum expected of EU Member States. The "
"phrase ΓΆβ‚¬Λin accordance with Union law and national laws "
"and practicesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά leaves some scope for national rules, "
"subject to review by the <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"(ECJ).</p> <h3>Right of collective bargaining at EU Level</h3> <p>The "
"right of collective bargaining, recognised by Article 28 of the "
"Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, finds a number of "
"applications at EU level. Moreover, the EU Charter requires the "
"institutions and bodies of the Union to respect all fundamental "
"rights, including the right of collective bargaining.</p> <p>For "
"instance, Articles 154 and 155 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the "
"European Union (TFEU) envisage a collective bargaining process at EU "
"level, whose final result is a European collective agreement. In this "
"framework, the obligations on ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe institutions and "
"bodies of the UnionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά include promoting consultation, "
"facilitating dialogue, ensuring support, and implementing agreements "
"at the joint request of the signatory parties. It is especially to "
"this process and outcome that the rights recognised by Article 28 must "
"be applied at EU level, with the resulting obligations of the "
"institutions and bodies of the Union.</p> <p>Collective bargaining and "
"collective agreements have become important in Union labour law in "
"light of the multiple functions they perform. First is the "
"quasi-legislative function assumed by the social partners engaged in "
"collective bargaining at EU level in the form of the <a "
"href=\\socialdialogue.htm\\>social dialogue</a>. This has led to "
"collective agreements given legal effect in the form of directives. In "
"the most recent cases, the agreements on harassment and violence at "
"work (2007) and on inclusive labour markets (2010), the result is not "
"to be embodied in a directive. This will highlight the central issue "
"of its precise legal effect, an issue on which Article 28 may be "
"engaged.</p> <p>Second, a general model emerging is that the "
"collective agreement may have an important function in facilitating "
"the implementation and application of Union labour law. This takes two "
"forms: collective bargaining and collective agreements are allocated a "
"role in the transposition of Union law into the national laws of the "
"Member States; and they are also allocated a role in the "
"flexibilisation of Union law, allowing for its adaptation to the "
"specific national context of industrial relations and employment "
"practices in each Member State.</p> <p>Third, collective bargaining "
"and collective agreements are recognised as reflecting fundamental "
"social objectives and values, which are to be protected against "
"competing objectives and values in Union law, in particular, those of "
"competition law. The status of these competing objectives and values "
"in the Treaty does not necessarily indicate which have priority. It "
"may be that Article 28 of the EU Charter, referring to rights "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λin accordance with Union lawΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, may not "
"confer absolute protection to collective bargaining and collective "
"agreements. In deciding the hierarchy of values and objectives, "
"however, the ECJ may give more weight to the right of collective "
"bargaining recognised in Article 28 in the absence of recognition of "
"competing values (e.g. of competition) in the Charter of Fundamental "
"Rights of the European Union.</p> <p>The guarantee in Article 28 of "
"the fundamental right of collective bargaining and action may serve to "
"reinforce all these multiple roles of collective agreements. In "
"practice, they may be used to challenge obstacles placed by EU "
"institutions or Member States in the path of the social partners when "
"they are engaged in the process of collective bargaining or wish to "
"secure respect for collective agreements ΓΆβ‚¬Λin accordance "
"with Union lawΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"(99Kb PDF)</a>, the <a href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European "
"Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) held that while recognising the right to "
"strike, this may still represent a restriction on the freedom to "
"provide services and thus could only be conducted under EU law where "
"it was to pursue a legitimate aim and was justified by overriding "
"reasons of public interest. However, a less restrictive position was "
"taken in a case heard before the European Court of Human Rights (<a "

"In <i>Enerji Yapi-Yol Sen v. Turkey</i> (<a "

"not absolute and might be subject to certain restrictions, a law that "
"banned strikes would represent too wide a restriction.</p> <p>The "
"issue is thus not whether the right exists, but how it is exercised "
"and whether there are limits on the modality of engaging in the "
"conflict of interests. An outright prohibition of strike action in the "
"totality of public services could not be in conformity with the right "
"declared in Article 28, particularly given the decision in <i>Enerji "
"Yapi-Yol Sen v. Turkey</i>. Those laws which forbid strikes by certain "
"categories of civil servants are not likely to meet the standard set "
"out by the ECHR.</p> <p>The International Labour Organization (ILO) "
"does not include the right to strike explicitly in the text of its "
"constitution and numerous conventions. However, it has been affirmed "
"in the case law developed by the ILOΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Freedom of "
"Association Committee, interpreting Convention No. 87. An express "

"States have explicitly recognised the right to strike. In others, it "
"is not explicit but implied, and in several it is not possible to "

"        arises from the promotion and practice of social "

"\\n"
"        <p>At EU level, this right is provided for in Article 28, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛRight of collective bargaining and "

"        negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the "

"collective action to defend\\n"
"        their interests, including strike action.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The same actors who enjoy the rights to negotiate and "
"conclude collective agreements have ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe right... to "
"take collective action..., including\\n"
"        strike actionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. This formulation can be read "
"as recognising the <a href=\\righttostrike.htm\\>right to strike</a>. "
"If collective action includes strike\\n"
"        action, and the former is qualified as a right, then the "
"latter must also be a right.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The right in Article 28 is qualified by the question of "
"which ΓΆβ‚¬Λconflicts of interestΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά give "
"workers and employers, or their respective organisations,\\n"
"        the right to take collective action ΓΆβ‚¬Λto defend "
"their interestsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. In the absence of any specific "
"limitations, Article 28 seems to cover all kinds of\\n"
"        interests, including, in principle, economic and political "
"interests.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>As to what is included within the scope of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λcollective actionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, the general "
"expression ΓΆβ‚¬ΛrightΓΆβ‚¬Β¦ to take collective "
"actionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά appears to embrace all\\n"
"        types of action aimed at self-help, which arise in cases of "
"conflicts of interest. It would therefore include "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λsecondary actionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, which is "

"\\n"
"        <p>Article 52 of the <a "
"href=\\charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter of "
"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> allows for\\n"
"        limitations, but these ΓΆβ‚¬Λmust be provided for by "
"law and respect the essenceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of the right to "
"collective action. Further, they are ΓΆβ‚¬Λsubject to the\\n"
"        principle of proportionalityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and must be "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λnecessary and genuinely meet objectives of general "
"interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect\\n"
"        the rights and freedoms of otherΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The "
"question may arise of potential conflict between the right to "
"collective action and other rights under Community\\n"
"        law, such as the right of establishment or free movement of "
"goods (<a href=\\montiregulation.htm\\>Monti Regulation</a>).</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>In partial response to potential conflicts between the EC "
"law on free movement of goods and collective industrial action, "
"Council Regulation No.\\n"
"        2679/98 (the Monti Regulation) provides protection for "
"fundamental rights in national law to take collective action "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λincluding the right or freedom to\\n"
"        strikeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The regulation reflects a policy "
"choice: the EU must respect the exercise of fundamental rights and "
"freedoms of collective action at national\\n"
"        level. It remains to be seen whether the same choice will be "
"made in the interpretation of the right to take collective action in "
"the EU Charter.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The EU Charter appears to make an important distinction "
"regarding the levels at which the rights in Article 28 can be "
"exercised. The right to\\n"
"        collective bargaining is granted ΓΆβ‚¬Λat the "
"appropriate levelsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, but this phrase does not qualify "
"the right to take collective action. Article 28,\\n"
"        therefore, stipulates no limitation on the levels at which the "
"right to collective action may be exercised.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The effect of the failure to grant the right to collective "
"action ΓΆβ‚¬Λat the appropriate levelsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is "
"open to at least two interpretations. First, the\\n"
"        qualifying limitation, ΓΆβ‚¬Λin accordance with "
"Community law and national laws and practicesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά could "
"allow for restrictions, subject to Article 52ΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs\\n"
"        limitations on any such national restrictions; not least, they "
"must ΓΆβ‚¬Λrespect the essence of rights and "
"freedoms.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Alternatively, the implication is\\n"
"        that collective action is permissible at ΓΆβ‚¬Λall "
"levelsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, including also at EU level. This would cover "
"cases where the collective industrial action\\n"
"        undertaken by a national organisation, or the demands of those "
"taking the collective actions, have an objective, which is "
"international, or is related\\n"
"        to the EU.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Finally, those entitled to take collective action include "
"workers or their organisations, and employers or their organisations. "
"The word ΓΆβ‚¬ΛorΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά\\n"
"        appears to indicate an alternative, not an exclusion. "
"According to some national constitutions and case law, the right to "
"strike is an individual\\n"
"        subjective right, which can be performed only collectively by "
"an association, group or organisation. It is not clear what impact "
"this formulation will\\n"
"        have on national contexts where, for instance, only trade "
"unions are entitled to exercise the right to collective industrial "
"action. The consequence\\n"
"        would be that workers and employers who are not members of "
"these organisations, or who are members of organisations not "
"recognised by the jurisdiction\\n"
"        as trade unions, have no legal right to take collective "
"action.</p>\\n"

"represents a significant development in relation to the exercise of "
"conflicting rights and potentially a weakening of the rights of trade "
"unions and workers.</p> <p>The freedom to provide cross-border "
"services is guaranteed under Article 56TFEU and, together with the "
"freedom of establishment, is acknowledged as a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λfundamental freedomΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά central to the "

"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0071:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"96/71/EC</a> on <a href=\\postedworkers.htm\\>posted workers</a> "
"provides that Member States should ensure that the terms and "
"conditions established by law or by universally applicable collective "
"agreements apply to workers who are called upon to work for a limited "
"period in another Member State. However, as the Laval case made clear, "
"the absence of a law or a universally applicable collective agreement "
"means that there is no term that must be applied.</p> <p>The "
"RΓƒΒΌffert case (Dirk RΓƒΒΌffert v Land&nbsp;Niedersachsen, "
"Case C-346/06) concerned a law from the German&nbsp;federal state of "
"Lower Saxony (Land Niedersachsen) on the award of public contracts, "
"applying to all contracts with a value of more than "
"ΓΆβ€Β¬10,000. The law was aimed at counteracting distortions "
"of competition within the construction and transport sectors that "
"could arise through the use of cheap labour, by limiting the right to "
"contract to those undertakings prepared to pay the wages laid down in "
"the relevant sectoral collective agreement. The law also extended "
"beyond the contract to sub-contractors and provided for a penalty on "
"the contractor for any breach of the law by the sub-contractor.</p> "
"<p>Land&nbsp;Niedersachsen awarded a contract for structural work in "
"the building of a prison to Objekt und Bauregie, with a contractual "
"term requiring that workers be paid the construction sector rate. "
"Objekt und Bauregie then sub-contracted the work to a company based in "
"Poland. Concerns were later raised that the sub-contractor was paying "
"its 53 workers employed on the building site just 46.57% of the "
"minimum wage laid down in the collective agreement. The contract was "
"terminated and a penalty notice was issued. Dirk RΓƒΒΌffert as the "
"liquidator of the assets of Objekt und Bauregie took a claim against "
"the payment of the penalty to a German national court that decided to "
"refer to the ECJ two questions concerning the freedom to provide "
"services. The first was whether the obligation to comply with "
"collective agreements meant that undertakings based in other Member "
"States would lose the competitive advantage they enjoyed by reason of "
"their lower wage costs, compared to those in Germany and also whether "
"this interfered with the freedom to provide cross-border services. The "
"second question was whether, if the law was an interference with this "
"freedom, it could be justified by overriding reasons related to the "
"public interest, in particular for the necessary protection of "
"workers.</p> <p>In its ruling on the RΓƒΒΌffert case, the ECJ held "
"that <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0071:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"96/71/EC</a> on the posting of workers would apply to cross-border "
"services if an employment relationship existed between the undertaking "
"and the employee during the period of the posting. It held that this "
"was the case and the fact that the objective of the German law did not "
"refer to the directive on posted workers did not mean that the "
"directive was not applicable. The court noted that the German law did "
"not itself fix a minimum rate but merely applied the terms of a "
"collectively agreed rate and noted also that the requirement was not "
"universally applicable, as it only applied in relation to public "
"service works. The fact that private sector workers did not benefit "
"from the German law meant that it was not arguable that it was for the "
"protection of workers or had the objective of ensuring the protection "
"of independence in the organisation of working life by trade "
"unions.</p> <p>Shortly after the ECJ had given its ruling on the "
"RΓƒΒΌffert case, it was confronted with another case which "
"similarly concerned measures to counter unfair competition, <a "
"href=\\http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=rechercher&amp;numaff=C-319/06\\>Commission "
"v Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Case C-319/06</a>. In its ruling on this "
"case on 19 June 2008, it held that a Member State could not define "
"which national public policy provisions were so important that they "
"should apply to national and foreign service providers equally, to "
"counter such competition.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>The signatories to the Agreement signed at Schengen on 14 "
"June 1985 ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the five Member States Belgium, France, "
"Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands ΓΆβ‚¬β€ agreed that "
"they would gradually remove their common border controls and introduce "
"freedom of movement for all nationals of the signatory Member States, "
"other Member States or third countries. The Schengen Convention was "
"signed by the same five States on 19 June 1990 but did not enter into "
"force until 1995. It lays down the arrangements and guarantees for "
"implementing freedom of movement. The Agreement and the Convention, "
"the rules adopted on that basis and the related agreements together "
"form the ΓΆβ‚¬ΛSchengen <i>acquis</i>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> "
"<p>The objective was to remove border controls, approximate visa "
"formalities and provide for cooperation of law enforcement agencies. "
"There are common controls at the external borders of the Schengen "
"area, but none at the internal frontiers, though document checks may "
"still be carried out on individuals by competent police "
"authorities.</p> <p>Article 26 TFEU (inserted as Article 14 EC by the "
"<a href=\\singleeuropeanact.htm\\>Single European Act</a> 1986) "
"provides that:</p> <ul> <li>The Union shall adopt measures with the "
"aim of establishing or ensuring the functioning of the internal "
"market, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the "
"Treaties.</li> <li>The internal market shall comprise an area without "
"internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, "
"services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of "
"the Treaties.</li> </ul> <p>As regards free movement of persons, the "
"EU Member States had not earlier been able to agree on common "
"provisions.</p> <p>The 1985 Schengen Agreement, therefore, anticipated "
"this provision on free movement and was an attempt by five Member "
"States to achieve progress outside the EU framework. Italy, Portugal, "
"Spain and Greece acceded to the Schengen Convention in 1990, Austria "
"in 1995, Denmark, Sweden and Finland in 1996.The Czech Republic, "
"Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and "
"Slovakia joined on 21 December 2007 and the associated country "
"Switzerland on 12 December 2008. Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania are not "
"yet fully-fledged members of the Schengen area; border controls "
"between them and the Schengen area are maintained until the EU Council "
"decides that the conditions for abolishing internal border controls "
"have been met. The United Kingdom and Ireland remain outside.</p> <p>A "
"Protocol attached by the <a href=\\treatyofamsterdam.htm\\>Treaty of "

"Agreement, the implementing Convention of 1990 and decisions taken "
"under those instruments, into EU law. The Protocol (now Protocol "
"no.19) makes special provision for the UK and Ireland, which are not "

msgid ""
"<br /> <p>Sectoral coordination of collective bargaining aims to "
"maintain purchasing power of employees in the sector and achieve a "
"balanced participation in productivity increases. It is defined by the "
"European MetalworkersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Federation (EMF) as something "
"that must ΓΆβ‚¬Λoffset the rate of inflation and "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Β¦ ensure that workers\\' incomes retain a balanced "
"participation in productivity gainsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά based on a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λcommitment to safeguard purchasing power and to reach a "
"balanced participation in productivityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>The "
"impetus for sectoral coordination of collective bargaining came "
"towards the end of the 1990s, when some national trade unions began to "
"question competitive bargaining strategies based on wage moderation, "
"which had contributed to real wages becoming decoupled from "
"productivity increases. The first sector-level collective bargaining "
"coordination initiative was launched by the EMF in 1998, under which "
"the EMFΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs national affiliates committed themselves to "
"seek in their national bargaining negotiations pay increases that "
"fully recompense national inflation and productivity increases. The "
"EMF established a rule in December 1998 that stated that "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe main reference point for the EMF affiliates must be "
"to maintain purchasing power and achieve a balanced participation in "
"productivity increasesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The coordination of "
"bargaining in the metalworking industry is carried out through the "
"EMFΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs <a href=\\http://www.eucoban.eu/\\>Eucob@n</a> "
"network.</p> <p>The EMFΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs role is particularly "
"important in the European context, since the metalworking sector often "
"sets the pattern for collective bargaining in Member States. In the "
"years since its adoption, it is reported that this rule has had an "
"effect mostly on the sharing of information and growing cooperation, "
"which can provide support in cases of conflict.</p> <p>While the "
"EU-level employer organisation in the metalworking sector, the Council "
"of European Employers of the Metal, Engineering and Technology-Based "
"Industries (CEEMET), has not issued any formal position on the Eucob@n "
"network of the EMF, in 2006 it issued a <a "
"href=\\http://ceemet.devstage.com/positiondocs/CEEMET%20position%20-%20December%202006.doc\\>statement</a> "
"in reaction to the European CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs preparatory "
"document on an optional European framework for transnational "
"collective bargaining. In this statement, CEEMET expresses its strong "
"opposition to the idea of an optional framework for transnational "
"collective bargaining, noting that so-called hard issues (such as pay "
"and working time) ΓΆβ‚¬Λremain almost exclusively the subject "
"of national collective bargaining at sector and/or company "
"levelΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Other sectors have also initiated "
"attempts to coordinate collective bargaining at EU level. For example, "
"the graphical section of UNI-Europa also adopted a wage coordination "
"rule based on inflation and national productivity, with the objective "
"of obtaining as large a share of productivity increases as "
"possible.</p> <p>Since the mid-1990s, the European Trade Union "
"Confederation (<a href=\\etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>) has been helping to "
"coordinate collective bargaining. In 1999 it set up a committee for "
"the coordination of collective bargaining, which has been working to "
"develop strategies for the European coordination of collective "
"bargaining. In December 2000, ETUC also endorsed a European "
"coordination rule that defined the national inflation plus "
"productivity rate as the benchmark for national collective "
"bargaining.</p> <p>Most recently, the ETUC, in a <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/a/6781\\>2010 resolution on the "
"coordination of collective bargaining</a> has urged trade unions to "
"resist wage freezes and wage cuts in the context of tentative economic "
"recovery. It notes that trade unions should refuse to bargain "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λarrangements which have the effect of poaching jobs "
"from other countries, regions and companies. This implies:</p> <ul> "
"<li>ensuring wage dynamics which are positive, both in nominal as well "
"as in real terms to prevent the economy from sliding into deflation "
"and/or a prolonged slump;</li> <li>overall wage cost developments "
"based on and reflecting the sum of trend productivity developments and "
"medium term inflationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</li> </ul> <p>See also: <a "

"<p>According to the fifth EWCS, around 15% of working people in Europe "
"are currently self-employed, and in many countries this status gives "
"rise to specific regulations, social protection and rights. The "
"proportion of self-employed people varies across the EU, from more "
"than 30% in Greece to fewer than 10% in Denmark, Latvia and Sweden. "
"The population of self-employed people fell in the early 2000s before "
"rising again by 2005 and declining slightly by 2010. The EWCS data "
"suggest the main decline is concentrated in the category of "
"self-employed with employees, down from 5% of workers in the third "
"EWCS to 4% in the fifth EWCS.</p> <p>In terms of occupation, according "
"to the fifth EWCS, 16% of self-employed people are professionals while "
"14% are craft and related workers. Between 15% and 17% are service and "
"sales workers, 17% are managers and 16% are skilled agricultural "
"workers. In total, 90% of self-employed people work in the private "
"sector.</p> <p>The fifth EWCS survey also found that self-employed "
"workers were more likely to work 48 hours a week or more. On average, "
"long hours are worked by 43% of self-employed workers without "
"employees, by 54% of self-employed workers with employees, and by just "
"11% of employees who were not self-employed. The survey also found "
"that 63% of employees work on a regular time schedule, compared with "
"just 33% of self-employed people with employees, and 29% of "
"self-employed people without employees.</p> <p>In terms of health and "
"safety, the survey found that 28% of self-employed people felt that "
"their health and safety was at risk due to their work, compared with "
"24% of employees on permanent contracts and 22% of employees on "
"temporary contracts. On the plus side, 91% of self-employed people "
"felt that they were doing useful work and had a feeling of job "
"satisfaction, compared with 82% of employees.</p> <p>The diversity of "
"work carried out by self-employed people has attracted various forms "
"of regulation. In the EU, self-employed people have been the subject "
"of increased attention, especially in the sphere of employment law, "
"with the focus on the areas of free movement and equal treatment, and "
"in the <a href=\\europeanemploymentstrategy.htm\\>European Employment "
"Strategy</a>.</p> <p>The second of the four pillars of the European "
"Employment Strategy is <a "
"href=\\entrepreneurship.htm\\>entrepreneurship</a>. One of its aims is "
"to increase the number of self-employed persons in the EU, "
"particularly by encouraging the Member States to reduce tax and social "
"security obstacles for this form of economic activity. In recent "
"times, boosting self-employment and entrepreneurship has been a focus "
"for European institutions as a means of increasing employment and "
"economic activity during the economic crisis which began in 2008.</p> "
"<h3>Free movement and self-employed persons</h3> <p>Article 53 of the "
"<a href=\\treatyonthefunctioningoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Treaty on the "
"Functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU) provides for the free "
"movement of those taking up and pursuing activities as self-employed "
"people. It stipulates:</p> <p><i>In order to make it easier for "
"persons to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons, the "
"Council shallΓΆβ‚¬Β¦ issue Directives for the mutual "
"recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal "
"qualifications.</i></p> <p>The <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"(ECJ) reinforced these Treaty provisions by defining "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛworkerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά as any person engaged in "
"economic activity. This definition ensures that all Treaty provisions "
"covering the free movement of workers also apply to the "
"self-employed.</p> <p>A number of Directives have been adopted to "
"promote the mutual recognition of diverse national systems of "
"qualification and their regulation, and the regulation of particular "
"<a href=\\professionalqualifications.htm\\>professional "
"qualifications</a>, such as those applying to lawyers, doctors and "
"architects. <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31989L0048:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 89/48/EEC</a> aimed to establish a general system for the "
"recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion of "
"professional education and training of at least three "
"yearsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά duration. Despite these legal moves, free "
"movement of the self-employed, particularly self-employed "
"professionals, has remained relatively low.</p> <h3>Equal treatment "
"and self-employed persons</h3> <p>Directive 2010/41/EU deals with the "
"application of the principle of the <a "
"href=\\equaltreatment.htm\\>equal treatment</a> of women and men "
"engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity. It states in "
"Article 4 that there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on grounds "
"of sex in the public or private sectors, either directly or "
"indirectly. There should be no discrimination, for instance, in "
"relation to the establishment, equipping or extension of a business or "
"the launch or extension of any other form of self-employed "
"activity.</p> <p>The Directive also states that where a national "
"social protection system exists for self-employed workers, the spouses "
"or life partners who participate in the activities of the "
"self-employed worker have the right to social protection in their own "
"name, in accordance with national law (Article 7). The Directive also "
"stipulates that Member States should ensure that female self-employed "
"workers and female spouses and life partners of self-employed people "
"are granted a maternity allowance that is sufficient to enable them to "
"cease economic activity for at least 14 weeks.</p> <p>Overall, the EU "
"is keen to encourage more women to be entrepreneurs and to become "
"self-employed. Women are currently an under-represented group among "
"the self-employed.</p> <p>The principle of equal treatment with "
"respect to self-employed people also extends beyond gender. <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0043:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 2000/43</a> implements the principle of equal treatment "
"between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. It applies to "
"all people in relation to:</p> <p><i>...conditions for access to "

"criteria and recruitment conditions, whatever the branch of activity "
"and at all levels of the professional hierarchy, including "

"<br /> <p>For the purpose of the directive, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛserviceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is defined as any "
"self-employed economic activity, normally provided for remuneration, "
"as referred to in Article 57 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the "
"European Union (TFEU). The directive is characterised by a horizontal "
"approach, i.e. a general legal framework applicable to all economic "
"service activities.</p> <p>The European Commission <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2004/com2004_0002en03.pdf\\>proposal "
"for a directive on services in the internal market (424Kb PDF)</a> "
"(COM(2004) 2 final/3) outlined that its objective was to provide a "
"legal framework that would eliminate the obstacles to the freedom of "
"establishment for service providers and the free movement of services "
"(referred to as ΓΆβ‚¬Λcross-borderΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"services) between the Member States, giving both the providers and "
"recipients of services the legal certainty they needed in order to "
"exercise these two fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaty.</p> "
"<p>On 15 November 2006, the European Parliament approved the <a "
"href=\\http://www.europarl.europa.eu/comparl/imco/services_directive/061227_oj_services_en.pdf\\>services "
"directive (212Kb PDF)</a> after more than two years of debate and "
"revision between the European Parliament, the Council of the European "
"Union and the European Commission. The text adopted in the second "
"reading broadly reflects the consensus achieved in the first reading "
"of 16 February 2006 and in the Council Common position of 24 July "
"2006. The directive entered into force on 28 December 2006 and had to "
"be implemented in the Member States before 28 December 2009. By this "
"date also, the European Commission was obliged to submit a report to "
"the European Parliament and the Council on the application of Article "
"16 on the principle of ΓΆβ‚¬ΛFreedom to provide "
"servicesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>A number of issues in the directive "
"that have a strong impact on industrial relations and "
"workerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs rights were at dispute. The key contentious "
"issues were the country of origin principle, the role of labour law, "
"the recognition of the fundamental right to collective bargaining and "
"the exclusion of services of general interest and sensitive sectors "
"such as temporary work agencies. These issues in the original 2004 "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛBolkesteinΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά directive proposal (named "
"after the then Internal Market Commissioner Frits Bolkestein) had "
"triggered strong opposition from trade unions and also from European "
"policy actors. In February 2005, the <a "
"href=\\europeaneconomicandsocialcommittee.htm\\>European Economic and "
"Social Committee</a> (EESC) adopted an opinion on the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs proposal that included a series of "
"suggestions for amendment of the draft directive. The EESC in "
"particular warned that an immediate application of the "
"country-of-origin principle would lead to a watering-down of "
"standards.</p> <p>The final directive, substantially rewritten by the "
"European Parliament, attempts to balance the aims to facilitate the "
"provision of cross-border services by removing obstacles to the free "
"movement of services in the internal market with social protection for "
"workers. The ΓΆβ‚¬Λcountry of originΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"principle was replaced by the ΓΆβ‚¬Λfreedom to provide "
"servicesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά principle.</p> <p>According to Article "
"1(6):</p> <p><i>ΓΆβ‚¬Β¦the Directive does not affect labour "
"law, that is, any legal or contractual provision concerning employment "
"conditions, working conditions, including health and safety at work "
"and the relationship between employers and workers, which Member "
"States apply in accordance with national law which respects Community "
"law. Equally, this Directive does not affect the social security "
"legislation of the Member States.</i></p> <p>The directive respects "
"the exercise of fundamental rights applicable in the Member States and "
"as recognised in the <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:303:0001:0016:EN:PDF\\>Charter "
"of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (139Kb PDF)</a>. It "
"strives to reconcile them with the fundamental freedom of "
"establishment as laid down in Articles 49 TFEU and the freedom to "
"provide services as laid down in Article 56 TFEU. The <a "
"href=\\charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter of "
"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> includes the right to "
"take industrial action. The text of the directive itself also "
"explicitly emphasises that it does not affect the right to negotiate, "
"conclude and enforce collective agreements and to take industrial "
"action (Article 1(7)).</p> <p>The introductory section of the "
"directive stresses the need to fully respect European Union "
"initiatives based on Article 153 TFEU with a view to achieving the "
"objectives of Article 151 TFEU concerning the promotion of employment "
"and improved living and working conditions.</p> <p>The <a "
"href=\\etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>, while committed to continue to campaign "
"for improvement in the European regulation of public services and in "
"sensitive areas such as temporary agency work, considered the outcome "
"of the discussion in the parliament a success. For the employers, the "
"<a href=\\ceep.htm\\>CEEP</a> welcomed the exclusion of services of "
"general interest and of health and social services from the scope of "
"the directive, while at the same time regretting the reduced scope of "
"the directive and the continued legal uncertainty on certain "
"provisions on cross-border provision of services. The <a "
"href=\\ueapme.htm\\>UEAPME</a> stated that the directive, if properly "
"applied at national level, would be beneficial for small and medium "
"enterprises. However, within particular sectors the directive is "
"considered to have greater consequences. At its annual meeting in "
"2007, the International Federation of Actors, <a "
"href=\\http://www.fia-actors.com/en/eurofia.html\\>EuroFia</a>, "
"continued to express concern that live performances remained within "
"the definition of services in the Directive.</p> <p>Several sectors "
"and activities, in particular services of general interest and "
"temporary work agencies, have explicitly been excluded from the "
"adopted text. The services directive does not affect the terms and "
"conditions of employment that apply to workers posted to provide a "
"service in the territory of another Member State. In the case of "
"posted workers, the directive obliges service providers to comply with "
"the terms and conditions of employment laid down by law or in "
"collective agreements in the Member State where the service is "
"provided. The Services Directive is subject to the co-decision "
"procedure.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>Services of general interest are those services, subject to "
"public regulation, whose provision meets a public need.</p> <p>The "
"term ΓΆβ‚¬Λservices of general interestΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"(SGIs) is not mentioned in the TFEU. Its meaning derives, in Union "
"practice, from the more common term ΓΆβ‚¬Λservices of general "
"economic interestΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (SGEIs), which is used in articles "
"14 and 106(2) TFEU. A precise definition of ΓΆβ‚¬Λservices of "
"general economic interestΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is also lacking in the "
"Treaties as well as in secondary legislation. However, there is "
"general agreement on using this expression in reference to services of "
"an economic nature on which Member States or the Union impose specific "
"public service obligations by virtue of a general interest criterion: "
"transport, postal services, water, waste disposal, energy, "
"telecommunications and all the other activities subject to public "
"service obligations. The term ΓΆβ‚¬Λservices of general "
"interestΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά covers a broader range of activities than "
"SGEIs do, including both market and non-market services, such as "
"healthcare, education and social services.</p> <p>Since the first "
"steps of European economic integration, a large number of sectors, "
"also those providing SGIs and SGEIs, have been opened up to market "
"liberalisation.</p> <p>A general overview of the situation in Europe "
"with regard to SGIs and SGEIs illustrates the complexity and the "
"differences among the Member States in terms of quality level, sectors "

"<br /> <p>Short-time work (STW) is defined in a 2010 European "
"Commission <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2010/pdf/ocp64_en.pdf\\>report "
"(781Kb PDF)</a> a temporary reduction in working time intended to "
"maintain an existing employer/employee relationship.</p> <p>It can "
"involve either a partial reduction in the normal working week for a "
"limited period of time ΓΆβ‚¬β€ for instance a partial "
"suspension of the employment contract ΓΆβ‚¬β€ or a "
"temporary layoff, such as a full suspension of the employment "
"contract. In both cases, the employment contract continues and is not "
"broken.</p> <p>While much of the focus concerning short-time work has "
"been on schemes that are publicly financed, short-time work can also "
"include company-initiated reductions in overtime, the use of working "
"time accounts and holiday entitlements, and numerous other types of "
"bilateral arrangement between employers and employees.</p> "
"<p>Short-time work is intended to help employers achieve numerical "
"flexibility during periods of temporary economic downturn without "
"resorting to layoffs. For the employer, this also has the advantage of "
"keeping trained labour, rather than needing to recruit once the "
"economic situation picks up.</p> <p>For the employee keeping a job, "
"even at a reduced level of working time and pay, it means they remain "
"in the labour market and may avoid a deterioration in their "
"skills.</p> <p>During the economic crisis of "
"2008ΓΆβ‚¬β€2010, short-time working was used extensively in "
"a number of EU Member States. It was used in Germany and Italy "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ which both have well-established public short-time "
"working systems ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the Netherlands, Slovenia, Austria "
"and Belgium. Short-time working in those countries was thought to have "
"been a major factor in ensuring that unemployment did not increase as "
"rapidly as had been expected during that time.</p> <p>According to the "
"European Labour Force Survey, during 2009 almost two million European "
"employees said they worked fewer hours due to a lack of work for "
"technical or economical reasons ΓΆβ‚¬β€ 55% of those "
"workers were from Germany and Italy.</p> <p>There is general agreement "
"among policymakers that training should be provided during short-time "
"work, and in some schemes training is mandatory. Despite this, uptake "
"of training is limited and there are concerns regarding the quality of "
"the training. Workers are not always motivated to take part and firms "
"may have limited experience of training methods, while the capacity "
"for training, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises "
"(SMEs), has proved a problem. The fragmented nature of training "
"systems in some countries is also a concern.</p> <p>More information "
"is available in the ERM Report 2010 <a "

"(ECJ) ruled that national legislation and provisions can apply a "
"pro-rata approach to entitlement to annual leave during short-time "
"working. In these cases, the workers concerned had claimed financial "
"compensation for annual leave while on a fixed-term period of zero "
"hours short-time working following redundancy, as provided for by a "
"company agreement.</p> <p>The ECJ has essentially ruled that the "

"        <p>The objective of a Single European Market (SEM), proposed "
"by the 1992 Single European Market Programme, had serious implications "
"for employment and\\n"
"        industrial relations in the EU. In particular, the SEM posed a "
"threat in the form of competition between enterprises in different "
"Member States faced\\n"
"        with different direct and indirect labour costs and different "
"systems of social and labour regulation (ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a "

"        and ΓΆβ‚¬Λsocial regime "
"competitionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά). The result was a fierce and protracted "
"battle between the European social partners over the political and "
"legal\\n"
"        strategies to be adopted with respect to the SEM.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The strategy of the trade unions at European level has been "

"ΓΆβ‚¬Λpolitical-distributiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά logic. This "
"recognised the\\n"
"        dangers posed by social dumping in the single market, but also "
"acknowledged the advantages to be reaped by enterprises free to "
"compete without national\\n"
"        hindrance. The aim was to achieve a balance between the costs "
"of the social protection necessary to offset the risk of social "
"dumping, and the losses\\n"
"        to enterprises entailed by this necessary degree of "
"regulation. The strategy, therefore, was one of political regulation "
"at European level to secure\\n"
"        the fair distribution of the benefits of the Single Market, "
"requiring attention to questions of labour and social standards and "
"implementation\\n"
"        mechanisms.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The strategy of employer organisations has been "
"characterised as dictated by an "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λeconomic-productiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά logic. The social "
"dimension of the single\\n"
"        market was to aim at achieving the maximum productive and "
"competitive efficiency. For firms in the European Community, the "
"principal competitive\\n"
"        challenge came from outside the EC ΓΆβ‚¬β€ mainly "
"the USA and Japan. Enterprises in those countries benefited from "
"significantly lower social and labour\\n"
"        standards, a competitive advantage which hindered enterprises "
"in Europe. The social policy of the EC in the new Single European "
"Market should,\\n"
"        therefore, aim at reducing this competitive advantage by "
"eliminating that social and labour regulation which was such a burden "
"on European\\n"
"        enterprises.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Each of these social policy strategies for the Single "
"European Market had an accompanying legal strategy. The deregulation "
"strategy put forward by\\n"
"        the employer organisations was based on the assumption that "
"there were to be no common social and labour standards imposed through "
"EC measures. This\\n"
"        had the advantage that it would reduce the need for a central "
"regulatory bureaucracy ΓΆβ‚¬β€ not required, given the "
"non-interventionist policy. It had the\\n"
"        corollary benefits of operating to inhibit social regulation "
"initiatives at national level, for fear of burdening Member State "
"enterprises. Finally, it\\n"
"        allowed for regulatory social regime competition in which "
"Member States would compete against each other to lower indirect "
"social and labour costs.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The debate continues on whether competition over labour and "

"<br /> <p>On 6 May 2003, the Commission adopted a new <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:124:0036:0041:en:PDF\\>Recommendation "
"2003/361/EC (122Kb PDF)</a> regarding the definition of small and "
"medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which replaced Recommendation "
"96/280/EC as of 1 January 2005. The revision takes account of the "
"economic developments since 1996 and the lessons drawn from the "
"application of the SME definition since 1996. It aimed to increase "
"legal certainty and reduce the opportunities for abuse, particularly "
"with regard to state aid, structural funds and the Research and "
"Development Framework Programme. The revision ensures that enterprises "
"which are part of a larger grouping and could therefore benefit from a "
"stronger economic backing than genuine SMEs do not benefit from SME "
"support schemes.</p> <p>According to this&nbsp;recommendation, an "
"enterprise is defined as ΓΆβ‚¬Λany entity engaged in an "
"economic activity, irrespective of its legal formΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. "
"This includes, in particular, self-employed persons and family "
"businesses engaged in craft or other activities, and partnerships or "
"associations regularly engaged in an economic activity.</p> <p>Under "
"the new definition, a ΓΆβ‚¬Λmedium-sized "
"enterpriseΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is an enterprise that employs fewer than "
"250 persons and that has an annual turnover not exceeding "
"ΓΆβ€Β¬50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not "
"exceeding ΓΆβ€Β¬43 million; a ΓΆβ‚¬Λsmall "
"enterpriseΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is an enterprise that employs fewer than "
"50 persons and whose annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet total "
"does not exceed ΓΆβ€Β¬10 million; a ΓΆβ‚¬Λmicro "
"enterpriseΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is an enterprise that employs fewer than "
"10 persons and whose annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet total "
"does not exceed ΓΆβ€Β¬2 million.</p> <p>Micro, small and "
"medium-sized enterprises are socially and economically important, "
"since they represent 99 % of all enterprises in the EU and provide "
"around 65 million jobs and contribute to entrepreneurship and "
"innovation. Nearly two million new SMEs emerge every year. They tend "
"to predominate in sectors which are less capital-intensive, and where "
"economies of scale are not crucial. For example, in construction, they "
"account for nearly 90% of all jobs, and in wholesale and retail "
"trades, hotels and restaurants, the figure is close to 80%. SMEs also "
"dominate in business and other services, with nearly seven out of 10 "
"people working in these sectors being employed by an SME. By and "
"large, they are businesses with a high growth and employment "
"potential.</p> <p>European policies explicitly take SMEs into account. "
"For example, Article 153(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the "
"European Union (TFEU) provides for the Council to adopt directives "

"<br /> <p>The overall concept of smart regulation is defined by the "
"European Commission in a <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/governance/better_regulation/smart_regulation/docs/smart_regulation_consultation_en.pdf\\>Stakeholder "
"Consultation on Smart Regulation</a>, issued in April 2010 as follows: "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛSmart regulation is not about more or less legislation, "
"it is about delivering results in the least burdensome "
"wayΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. It may be argued that smart regulation finds "
"some of its origins in the principle of proportionality as enshrined "
"in Article 5(4) TEU: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛUnder the principle of "
"proportionality, the content and form of Union action shall not exceed "
"what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the "
"TreatiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>In its October 2010 <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/governance/better_regulation/index_en.htm\\>Communication "
"on Smart Regulation in the European Union</a>, which followed on from "
"the April 2010 consultation, the Commission defined smart regulation "
"further as having three main characteristics:</p> <ol> <li>it concerns "
"the whole policy cycle - from the design of a piece of legislation, to "
"implementation, enforcement, evaluation and revision;</li> <li>it must "
"be a shared responsibility of the European institutions and of Member "
"States; and</li> <li>the views of those most affected by regulation "
"have a key role to play in smart regulation.</li> </ol> <p>The "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs October 2010 Communication states "
"further that the aim of smart regulation is to design and deliver "
"regulation that respects the principles of subsidiarity and "
"proportionality and is of the highest quality possible, and this must "
"be done throughout the policy cycle, from when a piece of legislation "
"is designed to when it is revised.</p> <p>A key part of ensuring that "
"EU regulation is smart regulation is reducing the administrative "
"burden and simplifying existing regulation. The Commission is "
"implementing this through a simplification programme that has brought "
"substantial benefits to citizens and businesses. Further, the "
"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs action programme for reducing "
"administrative burdens is, according to the Commission, likely to "
"exceed its target of cutting red tape by 25% by 2012. The Commission "
"is also extending the mandate of the High Level Group of Independent "
"Stakeholders until the end of 2012 in order to enable it to give "
"advice on issues relating to reducing the administrative burden for "
"business and simplifying legislation.</p> <p>The Commission is also "
"evaluating the costs and benefits of existing legislation, by means "
"such as ex post evaluations and more comprehensive policy evaluations "
"and ΓΆβ‚¬Λfitness checksΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. A total of four "
"such fitness checks were launched in 2010, including in areas of "
"employment and social policy (e.g. <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/informationandconsultation.htm\\>information "
"and consultation of workers</a>). Other key policy quality areas "
"include checking that new legislation is the best possible, improving "
"the implementation of existing legislation, and making legislation "
"clearer and more accessible.</p> <p>In terms of sharing "
"responsibility, the Commission states that the European Parliament and "
"Council have a key role to play in delivering smart regulation, for "
"example, in undertaking impact assessments on substantive amendments "
"they make to Commission proposals. However, the implementation of "
"smart regulation objectives also requires the input of the Member "
"States, particularly in the implementation of legislation. The "
"Commission notes that there is ΓΆβ‚¬Λno one size fits "
"allΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά approach to smart regulation, and encourages "
"Member States to define priorities on the basis of available human and "
"institutional capacities.</p> <p>Finally, the Commission notes that "
"consulting citizens and other stakeholders both when developing "
"policies and when evaluating whether they have done what they set out "
"to do is an essential element of smart regulation. It proposes to "
"increase the public consultation period on proposed legislation from "
"eight to 12 weeks from 2012, and to work to improve the quality of the "
"public consultation process.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"\\n"
"        <p>The CommunityΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs first SAP of 1974 was in "

"instructed to draw up a Social Action Programme. By a Resolution "

"        Ministers approved the Social Action Programme involving more "

"but not all, EU Member States have ratified the ILO Convention No. 94, "
"the use of social clauses in public procurement procedures is a very "
"controversial issue in the European Union. In EU public procurement "
"law and, in particular, <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"rulings concerning the issue, social clauses that go beyond the "
"minimum standards of labour law and universally applicable collective "
"agreements are seen to be in conflict with the principles of free "
"movement of goods and services as laid down in Articles 34 and 56 of "
"the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (former "
"Articles 28 and 49 EC Treaty) and acknowledged as "

"href=\\supremacyofeulaw.htm\\>supremacy of EU law</a> the requirements "
"of the internal market have led Member States to gradually remove "
"social clauses from their national laws.</p> <p>However, in some of "
"its rulings the ECJ has emphasised the social objectives of the "
"European Union and has acknowledged the possibility of allowing for "
"objectives of a general interest in public procurement under certain "
"circumstances. Against this background, on 21 September 1999, the ECJ "
"ruling in the Albany case clarified the relation of <a "
"href=\\competitionlawandcollectiveagreements.htm\\>competition law and "
"collective agreements</a> by concluding that collective agreements in "
"pursuit of objectives of general interest fall outside the scope of "
"competition rules.</p> <p>Since 2004 public procurement procedures are "

"2004/18/EC</a>, governing procedures for the award of public works, "
"and supply and service contracts in other sectors. Both directives "
"draw on former case law and include provisions concerning employment "
"protection, working conditions and social issues. For instance, "
"according to Article 38 of Directive 2004/17/EC and Article 26 of "
"Directive 2004/18/EC, contracting authorities may lay down special "

"(COM(2004) 557) of 12 August 2004, the European Commission proposes a "

"<br /> <p>There is no clear, universally accepted definition of social "

"service providers because their labour standards are "
"lowerΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. It gives its definition in relation to "
"descriptions of the <a "

"clause?</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in which the authors define social "
"dumping as the decision of a business in a developed country to:</p> "
"<p><i>supply its domestic market through production located in a "
"developing economy where labour standards do not comply with the "
"minimum requirements adopted by the home country, therefore allowing "
"the firm to enjoy lower production costs.</i></p> <p>Daniel "
"Vaughan-Whitehead also looked at the subject in his 2003 <a "

"<i>EU enlargement versus social Europe? The uncertain future of the "
"European social model</i>. In it, he distinguishes between a narrow "
"definition of social dumping, limited to respecting or failing to "
"respect the law, and a more general definition based on the notion of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λunfair competitionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Social "
"dumping is a hotly debated issue in European circles, and the term "
"itself has negative connotations, hinting at the exploitation of "
"workers.</p> <p>There are inevitably differences between Member States "
"in terms of labour costs, both direct and indirect. These can give "
"companies based in countries with comparatively lower costs a "
"competitive advantage. However, this advantage may be offset by "
"factors which favour enterprises in countries with higher labour and "
"social standards. These factors may include better transport "
"infrastructures or a more highly trained and skilled workforce. "
"Nevertheless, differences in direct and indirect labour costs may "
"create a significant competitive edge.</p> <p><a "
"href=\\tradeunions.htm\\>Trade unions</a> argue that one of the "
"consequences of such differences is that they raise the threat of "
"social dumping. They fear that as a result of what has been called "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λsocial policy regime competitionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"between Member States, national governments will be under pressure to "
"reduce their labour and social standards in order to ease the burden "
"of high indirect wage costs on enterprises. This could mean businesses "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ particularly multinational enterprises "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ will be tempted to locate new investment, or even "
"to relocate existing establishments, in countries where lower labour "
"and social standards lead to lower indirect labour costs.</p> <p>In "
"recent years, a number of cases in the <a "
"href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of Justice</a> "
"(ECJ) have dealt with issues related to social dumping and the "
"interaction between industrial relations rights and the freedom to "
"provide services.</p> <p>During 2007 and 2008, the "
"ECJΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs rulings on the <a "
"href=\\vikingcase.htm\\>Viking case</a>, <a "
"href=\\lavalcase.htm\\>Laval case</a> and RΓƒΒΌffert case imposed "
"limitations on attempts to use <a "
"href=\\collectivebargaining.htm\\>collective bargaining</a> and the <a "
"href=\\righttostrike.htm\\>right to strike</a> as measures to combat "
"social dumping.</p> <p>In the Viking and Laval cases, the ECJ ruled "
"that although the right to industrial action constitutes a restriction "
"of the freedom to provide cross-border services, it can be justified "
"under certain circumstances.</p> <p>In the Viking case, this "
"justification is linked to an overriding reason of public interest, "
"such as the protection of workers. Furthermore, the type of collective "
"action must be suitable to ensuring the attainment of the legitimate "
"objective pursued, and should not go further than what is necessary to "
"achieve that objective.</p> <p>In the Laval case, the ECJ ruled that "
"industrial action is in breach of the freedom to provide services if "
"it is aimed at imposing terms and conditions on foreign undertakings "
"which go beyond the minimum established by national law. Similarly, in "
"the RΓƒΒΌffert case, the ECJ ruling restricts the scope of social "

"<br /> <p>Social exclusion is the consequence of a series of problems "
"affecting an individual or group such as unemployment, discrimination, "
"poor skills, low income, poor housing, high crime,&nbsp;ill-health and "
"family breakdown. When such problems combine, they can create a "
"vicious cycle. Social exclusion has complex and multi-dimensional "
"causes and consequences, creating deep and long-lasting problems for "
"individual families, for the economy, and for society as a whole.</p> "
"<p>The CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs 1992 Communication "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛTowards a Europe of solidarityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (COM "
"(92) 542) describes social exclusion as the result of "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λmechanisms whereby individuals and groups are excluded "
"from taking part in the social exchanges, from the component practices "
"and rights of social integration and of identity. Social exclusion "
"goes beyond participation in working life; it is felt and shown in the "
"fields of housing, education, health and access to "
"servicesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Combating social exclusion and "
"poverty were signalled as priorities at the Essen European Council of "
"1994, and the Lisbon Presidency Conclusions of March 2000 stipulated "
"the objective of mainstreaming the fight against social exclusion at "
"national and EU levels. Furthermore, the <a "

"Chapter of the EC Treaty by adding to the list of areas, where the "
"Council may adopt measures designed to encourage cooperation between "
"Member States, the fight against social exclusion (Article 137(1)(j) "
"EC (now Article 153(1)(j) TFEU). The Nice European Council of December "
"2000 published common objectives on poverty and social exclusion. "
"However, this area was not to be subject to Council action in the form "
"of new directives.</p> <p>To address the problems of poverty and "
"social exclusion by 2010, the Lisbon Council agreed to adopt the <a "
"href=\\openmethodofcoordination.htm\\>open method of coordination</a>. "
"The key elements consisted of common objectives on poverty and social "

"<br /> <p>Social policy is a key strand of EU policy and the European "
"Commission has initiated successive social policy agendas over the "
"past decade. Its <a href=\\socialactionprogramme.htm\\>Social Action "
"Programme</a> ran from 1998 to 2000 and was followed by its Social "
"Policy Agenda 2000-2005, further to which the Commission established a "
"High-Level Group to identify the main challenges and opportunities "
"facing the European Union over the period 2006-2010 in the field of "
"employment and social policy. The findings of this group contributed "
"to the development of the next Social Policy Agenda, which ran from "
"2006 to 2010 under the <a href=\\lisbonstrategy.htm\\>Lisbon "
"Strategy</a>. The three main challenges facing the European Union that "
"the group identified were: enlargement, the ageing of the population "
"and globalisation and the Social Policy Agenda 2006-2010 focused on "
"providing jobs and equal opportunities for all and ensuring that the "
"benefits of the EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs growth and jobs drive reach "
"everyone in society. By modernising labour markets and social "
"protection systems, it aimed to help people seize the opportunities "
"created by international competition, technological advances and "
"changing population patterns, while protecting the most vulnerable in "
"society.</p> <p>In July 2008, the Commission adopted a <a "

"not constitute economic activity necessary to constitute an enterprise "

"35), Access to services of general economic interest (Article 36), "
"Environmental protection (Article 37) and Consumer protection (Article "
"38). They are solidarity rights in the social sense of the collective "
"principle in the EC law on social protection.</p> <p>Article 2 of the "

"The EU principle of solidarity has implications for the various rights "

"<br /> <p>The <a href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of "
"Justice</a> (ECJ) has developed a general principle of state "
"responsibility for non-compliance with EU law. State liability derives "
"from the fact that EU Member States are responsible for the creation "
"and above all for the implementation and enforcement of EU law. "
"Enforcement of state liability for violations of rights granted to "
"individuals by EU law, including in the fields of employment and "
"industrial relations, is carried out through the national courts of "
"the Member States.</p> <p>Many EU rights, particularly those in the "
"many directives in the fields of employment and industrial relations, "
"are enforced through the doctrine of <a "
"href=\\directeffect.htm\\>direct effect</a> of directives: the state "
"and <a href=\\emanationsofthestate.htm\\>emanations of the state</a> "
"are liable, even where responsibility for the non-implementation of "
"the EU directive lies with other organs of the State. The impact of "
"directives remains limited, however, by the insistence of the ECJ on "
"the exclusively vertical responsibility of the state (<a "
"href=\\verticaldirecteffect.htm\\>vertical direct effect</a>) which "
"prevents enforcement of directives against private individuals (<a "
"href=\\horizontaldirecteffect.htm\\>horizontal direct effect</a>) even "
"where EU law imposes responsibilities on these persons.</p> <p>The "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λuseful effectΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (from the French "
"<i>effet utile</i>) rationale for direct effect requires a remedy "
"where private individuals fail to respect provisions of EU law. To "
"circumvent the limitations of the doctrine of horizontal direct "
"effect, the ECJ developed a general principle of state responsibility "
"for compliance with EU law. This doctrine was created by a case in the "
"field of employment rights: <i>Andrea Francovich and Others v. Italian "
"Republic</i>, Joined <a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61990J0006:EN:HTML\\>Cases "
"C-6/90 and C-9/90</a>, [1991] ECR I-5357, and the resulting principle "
"of state liability is called the <a "
"href=\\francovichprinciple.htm\\>Francovich principle</a>.</p> <p>The "
"elements of liability, which comprise the <i>Francovich</i> principle, "
"that emerged from the decision of the ECJ include: (i) a breach of EU "
"law; (ii) attributable to the Member State; (iii), which causes damage "
"to an individual. If these elements are established, <a "
"href=\\compensation.htm\\>compensation</a> may be claimed in a legal "
"action before a national court.</p> <p>The principle of state "
"liability was said to be also explicit in Article 4(3) TEU. It relies "
"on a basic principle of the EU legal order: that national courts must "
"protect the rights conferred by EU law on individuals, including "
"enforcement of these rights where the state is responsible.</p> <p>The "
"breach of EU law in the <i>Francovich</i> case itself was a violation "
"of the EU directive by reason of the national legislator failing to "
"act to implement it. However, total failure to implement a directive "
"is only one type of violation of EU law. Implementation of a directive "
"by a Member State may be partial or incorrect or inadequate. There are "
"numerous decisions of the European Court upholding complaints against "
"Member States for faulty implementation of a directive.</p> <p>The "
"Member State remains responsible even when it has entrusted "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λmanagement and labour, at their joint request, with the "
"implementation of directives adopted pursuant to paragraphs 2 and "
"3ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, according to article 153(3) TFEU. In this case, "
"the Member State must ensure that ΓΆβ‚¬Λmanagement and labour "
"have introduced the necessary measures by agreementΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"and must take ΓΆβ‚¬Λany measure enabling it at any time to be "
"in a position to guarantee the results imposed by that "
"directiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Violations of EU law by different "
"organs of the state will engage liability; the state is responsible "
"for acts of public law bodies or others to which the state has "
"delegated the performance of its responsibilities. For example, the "
"Court has held that failure to transpose a directive into national law "
"within the prescribed time limit amounts of itself to a sufficiently "
"serious breach, giving rise to state liability (<i>Dillenkoffer and "
"others v. Federal Republic of Germany</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994J0178:EN:HTML\\>Cases "
"C-178-9/94, 188-190/94</a> [1996]).</p> <p>The principle of state "
"responsibility has potentially far-reaching implications for the "
"enforcement of EU labour law. If an individual has a definable "
"interest protected by the directive, failure by the state to act to "
"protect that interest may lead to state liability where the individual "
"suffers damage, provided causation can be demonstrated. The directives "
"on <a href=\\healthandsafety.htm\\>health and safety</a> at work, on "
"<a href=\\equaltreatment.htm\\>equal treatment</a> of women and men, "
"and an increasing number of directives regulating individual and "

"is to provide employers and workers with a framework to identify and "

"as:</p> <p><i>a state, which is accompanied by physical, psychological "

"began to consult the European social partners on work-related stress "
"in 2002. As there have been no legal provisions specifically aiming at "
"work-related stress, action at Community level was seen as necessary "
"to ensure a minimum level of protection for workers against "
"work-related stress. In the consultation of the social partners on "
"stress and its effects on health and safety at work, the European "
"Commission refers to an estimated cost of at least 20 billion euro "
"each year, based on 1999 figures for the European countries. A first "
"interim assessment took place at the meeting of the Social Dialogue "

"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/FRAMEWORKAGREEMENTS.htm\\>framework "
"agreement</a> on work-related stress has to be implemented "
"autonomously by the European social partners and their affiliated "
"organisations in accordance with the national procedures and practices "
"specific to management and labour.</p> <p>The agreement is based on "
"the recognition that work-related stress can be caused by various "
"factors such as work content, work organisation, work environment or "
"poor communication. The objective of the agreement is to provide "
"employers and workers with a framework to identify and prevent or "
"manage problems of work-related stress. The agreement gives guidance "
"as regards measures to prevent, eliminate or reduce problems of "
"work-related stress.</p> <p>In the case that a problem with "
"work-related stress is identified or action must be taken to prevent, "
"eliminate or reduce stress, the responsibility for determining the "
"appropriate measures rests with the employer. Workers have a general "
"duty to comply with measures determined by the employer. The framework "
"agreement is due to be implemented within three years. It entails a "
"clause on the monitoring of the implementation of the agreement and "
"providing of annual interim reports in the first three years and a "
"full report in the fourth year.</p> <p>After four years, the European "
"Social Partners adopted a <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/IMG/pdf_Final_Implementation_report.pdf\\>joint "
"report</a> on the implementation of the Agreement, published on 15 "
"December 2008. The report is based on joint national reports from "
"member organisations in 21 EU Member States, Iceland and Norway. The "
"Commission published a report on the implementation of the European "

"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2011/02/articles/eu1102051i.htm\\>EU1102051I</a>). "
"This report gives an overview of activities that have been carried out "
"to implement the agreement. The implementation instruments can be "
"grouped into roughly four categories: national collective agreements; "
"general agreements or recommendations and guidelines for rank-and-file "
"members; declarations; or legislation. However, the report stressed "
"that there were substantial joint social partner implementation "
"efforts in only 11 Member States plus Iceland and Norway. Moderate or "
"unilateral efforts were observed in seven Member states. Limited "
"initiatives, or a total lack of initiatives, were observed in 10 other "
"Member States. The report concludes that implementation of the "
"agreement has not yet ensured a minimum degree of effective protection "
"for workers from work-related stress throughout the EU and that all "
"stakeholders need to consider further initiatives to ensure that this "
"goal is achieved.</p> <p>The social partners are also dealing with the "

"room for manoeuvre (work speed, method, and order of tasks) and "
"reported social support have not been increasing. According to the "
"Labour Force Survey ad hoc module on occupational health and safety "
"2007, 23% of the workers reported exposure to time pressures or "
"overload of work that would harm their health.</p> <p>Regarding "
"emotional demands, client contact is a source of pleasure and "
"gratification, but in certain circumstances it may turn into a "
"difficult pressure. Client contact (almost) all of the time increased "
"has slightly, to 44% within the last 10 years. 5% deal with an angry "
"client most of their working time, 30% of workers are required to hide "
"their emotions, 18% report that a mistake in their work could cause "
"physical injury and 35 % that it could cause financial loss for their "

msgid ""
"<br /> <p>The principle of subsidiarity regulates the exercise of "
"powers in the European Union. It is intended to determine whether, in "
"an area where there is joint competence, the Union can take action or "
"should leave the matter to the Member States. The subsidiarity "
"principle is based on the idea that decisions must be taken as closely "
"as possible to the citizen: the Union should not undertake action "
"(except on matters for which it alone is responsible) unless EU action "
"is more effective than action taken at national, regional or local "
"level.</p> <p>The subsidiarity principle was introduced by the <a "
"href=\\treatyofmaastricht.htm\\>Treaty of Maastricht</a> and was "
"further elaborated in a Protocol on the application of the principle "
"attached to the <a href=\\treatyofamsterdam.htm\\>Treaty of "
"Amsterdam</a>. Today, the principle is defined in Article 5 TEU:</p> "
"<p><i>Under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do not fall "
"within its exclusive competence, the Union shall act only if and in so "
"far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently "
"achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional "
"and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of "
"the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.</i></p> "
"<p><i>The institutions of the Union shall apply the principle of "
"subsidiarity as laid down in the Protocol on the application of the "
"principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. National Parliaments "
"ensure compliance with the principle of subsidiarity in accordance "
"with the procedure set out in that Protocol.</i></p> <p>In effect, "
"this principle only applies when the Union and Member States both have "
"competence. The question is, which of the two (EU or the Member "
"States) is to exercise the competence. As defined in Article 5 TEU, "
"there are two conditions for Union action: first, insufficient "
"achievement by Member States of the objectives of the proposed action; "
"and, secondly, better achievement by the Union by reason of the scale "
"or effects of the proposed action.</p> <p>The concept of subsidiarity "
"was initially introduced as a result of pressure on the one hand from "
"certain regions ΓΆβ‚¬β€ in particular the German federal "
"states (<i>LΓƒΒ¤nder</i>) ΓΆβ‚¬β€ to use subsidiarity "
"as a way to protect their regional autonomy recognised at the national "
"level, and on the other from certain Member States ΓΆβ‚¬β€ "
"in particular the UK ΓΆβ‚¬β€ that saw in subsidiarity a "
"tool to protect themselves against encroaching Union intervention. "
"However, the concept as enshrined into the Treaty has focused on the "
"relations between Union and Member States ΓΆβ‚¬β€ with the "
"exception of a Declaration attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam which "
"states that ΓΆβ‚¬Λfor the German, Austrian and Belgian "
"governments it remains understood that the actions of the European "
"Community on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity concern not "
"only the Member States, but also their bodies, to the extent that "
"these bodies possess their own legislative powers, conferred on them "
"by national constitutional lawΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>The new <a "
"href=\\treatyoflisbon.htm\\>Treaty of Lisbon</a>, as it entered into "
"force on 1 December 2009, broadens the definition of subsidiarity to "
"the regional and local level (Article 5 (2) TEU). It also introduces, "
"in a revised Protocol on the application of the principle of "
"subsidiarity and proportionality attached to the Treaty of Lisbon, a "
"new <i>ex ante</i> political monitoring mechanism through which any "
"national parliament or any chamber of a national parliament will be "
"enabled to issue a reasoned opinion regarding compliance with the "
"principle by EU proposals of a legislative nature.</p> <p>See also: <a "

msgid ""
"<br /> <p>The legal doctrine of supremacy of <a href=\\eulaw.htm\\>EU "
"law</a> means that EU labour law takes precedence over domestic labour "
"law. The creation of a new legal order of EU law and its supremacy "
"means that EU institutions may create rules affecting employment and "
"industrial relations, even where some Member States oppose such rules "
"and vote against them in those EU institutions, provided that a voting "
"procedure based on a majority rule applies to that specific field. "
"Where adopted, these rules must be enforced in national courts, even "
"where this involves overriding rules produced by domestic law-making "
"institutions. In the course of time, national constitutional courts "
"have accepted the principles of supremacy of the EU law affirmed by "
"the <a href=\\europeancourtofjustice.htm\\>European Court of "
"Justice</a>, but at the same time they have envisaged a limit to it in "
"the fundamental principles of each national constitution.</p> <p>This "
"supremacy is well known in certain areas such as sex <a "
"href=\\discrimination.htm\\>discrimination</a>, where the domestic law "
"of many Member States has been shaped, and, in cases of conflict, has "
"been repeatedly overridden, by the rulings of the European Court of "
"Justice. Probably the best known example of the impact of these "
"rulings in labour law is <i>G. Defrenne v. Sabena</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;numdoc=61975J0043&amp;lg=en\\>Case "
"43/75</a>, (1976) ECR 455, where the European Court decided that, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe principle that women and men should receive <a "
"href=\\equalpay.htm\\>equal pay</a>, which is laid down by Article 119 "
"EC [now Article 157 TFEU], may be relied on before the national "
"courts. These courts have a duty to ensure the protection of the "
"rights, which that provision vests in individuals, in particular in "
"the case of those forms of discrimination which have their origin in "
"legislative provisionsΓΆβ‚¬Β¦.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>The "
"wider the range of EU competences in the field of employment and "
"industrial relations, the more the EU law they create will come to "
"replace increasingly wide areas of national labour law. An example is "
"the decision of the European Court in <i>Commission v. United "
"Kingdom</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;numdoc=61992J0382&amp;lg=en\\>Case "

"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;numdoc=61992J0383&amp;lg=en\\>Case "
"C-383/92</a>, [1994]. There the Court required the United Kingdom to "
"create a system of worker representation where none existed. "
"Designation of worker representatives was made mandatory by the Court, "
"due to the consequences for the rights of workers under two directives "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λwhich require Member States to take all measures "
"necessary to ensure that workers are informed, consulted and in a "
"position to intervene through their representatives in the event of "
"collective redundancies [or the transfer of an "
"undertaking]ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;numdoc=61992J0383&amp;lg=en\\>Case "

"C-382/92</a>, paragraph 26). In order to perform effectively the tasks "
"of information and consultation specified in the directives, Member "
"State laws or practices must ensure the designation of worker "
"representatives.</p> <p>Given that it may be applied in national "
"courts, the doctrine of supremacy also applies to rules on enforcement "
"of labour law, including remedies and procedures. The ECJ has "
"developed special techniques and principles by which EU labour law may "
"be enforced in national courts. Where EU enforcement requirements come "
"into conflict with national procedures and remedies, again, they take "
"precedence and must be applied by national courts overriding domestic "
"rules. Remarkable instances have included the CourtΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"decision in <i>Marshall v. Southampton and South West Area Health "
"Authority (No. 2</i>), <a "

"C-271/91</a>, (1993), abolishing the limits on compensation for sex "
"discrimination in the UK legislation.</p> <p>Through the doctrine of "
"supremacy, EU law has promoted the Europeanisation of employment and "

"2008/104/EC</a> on temporary agency work defines a temporary work "
"agency (Article 3.1b) as:</p> <p><i>any natural or legal person who, "
"in compliance with national law, concludes contracts of employment or "
"employment relationships with temporary agency workers in order to "
"assign them to user undertakings to work there temporarily under their "
"supervision and direction</i></p> <p>The Directive also defines a "
"temporary agency worker (Article 3.1c) as:</p> <p><i>a worker with a "
"contract of employment or an employment relationship with a "
"temporary-work agency with a view to being assigned to a user "
"undertaking to work temporarily under its supervision and "
"direction</i></p> <p>The Directive defines a user undertaking (Article "
"3.1d) as:</p> <p><i>any natural or legal person for whom and under the "
"supervision and direction of whom a temporary agency worker works "
"temporarily</i></p> <p>The Directive defines a temporary work "
"assignment (Article 3.1e) as</p> <p><i>the period during which the "
"temporary agency worker is placed at the user undertaking to work "
"temporarily under its supervision and direction</i></p> <p>The basic "
"common feature of all agency work is a ΓΆβ‚¬Λthree-way "
"relationshipΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, sometimes called a triangular "
"employment relation, between a user undertaking, an <a "
"href=\\employee.htm\\>employee</a> and an agency.</p> <p>Temporary "
"agency work is increasing rapidly in almost all European countries, as "
"part of the general movement towards increased <a "
"href=\\flexibility.htm\\>flexibility</a> in employment. It is "
"estimated that over three million workers in the EU are currently "
"temporary agency workers and the numbers involved in this sector have "
"been increasing. A large proportion of temporary agency work is done "
"by low-skilled workers, although many assignments are also for skilled "
"technical and professional positions. The degree of regulation of "
"agency work by Member States ranges from very strict to very flexible, "
"from legislative regulation to regulation by collective agreement or "
"even <a href=\\codesofconduct.htm\\>codes of conduct</a>. Regulation "
"of the employment relationship in agency work engages not only the "
"employer and employee, but also the third party user of the services "
"provided by the agency and by the employee.</p> <p>It should be noted "
"that EU regulation of transnational agency workers already exists in "
"the form of <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0071:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"96/71/EC</a>, concerning the posting of workers in the framework of "
"the provision of services. In practice, this Directive covers the "
"transnational posting of temporary agency workers, and requires that "
"the basic working and employment conditions in force in the host "
"country have to be applied to both national and <a "
"href=\\postedworkers.htm\\>posted workers</a>, if the latter are "
"employees of an undertaking established in another country.</p> <p>The "
"social partners launched a social dialogue at the end of the 1990s "
"with the aim of reaching a framework agreement on the regulation of "
"temporary agency work in the European Union. However, in May 2001, the "
"negotiations ended in failure. In March 2002, following the breakdown "
"in negotiations between the social partners, the European Commission "
"adopted a proposal for a Directive on Temporary Agency Workers. The "
"proposal set out the general principle of <a "
"href=\\equaltreatment.htm\\>equal treatment</a>, under which temporary "
"agency workers would receive the same pay and basic working conditions "
"as permanent workers carrying out the same or similar jobs in the "
"company to which they are assigned. However, despite a major revision "
"of the text of the proposed Directive in November 2002, another "
"attempt in June 2003 in the Council of Ministers to achieve a "
"consensus paving the way for the proposed Directive to progress though "
"the legislative procedure failed. It was not until 2008 that the "
"conclusion of two key agreements by the social partners finally "
"created the conditions for adoption of the Directive by the European "
"Parliament.</p> <p>The first of these was a joint agreement on equal "
"treatment for temporary agency workers in May 2008, concluded between "
"social partners and the government in the United Kingdom. This "
"provided for a 12-week opt-out from the provisions of any forthcoming "
"EU Directive, with respect to UK agency workers, but otherwise "
"favoured adoption of the Directive. The second <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/dsw/public/actRetrieveText.do?id=8665\\>was "
"a joint declaration</a> on the Directive signed, also in May 2008, by "
"the social partners at European level ΓΆβ‚¬β€ Eurociett, "
"the employer organisation representing agency work in the EU, and "
"UNI-Europa, the trade union. This supported the regulation of the "
"industry by means of a Directive and favoured the adequate protection "
"of agency workers, while acknowledging the positive role that agency "
"work could play in the labour market to fulfil the requirements of the "
"<a href=\\lisbonstrategy.htm\\>Lisbon Strategy</a>.</p> <p>Following "
"these two events, the European Parliament voted in favour of the "
"Directive in October 2008 and EU Directive 2008/104/EC on temporary "
"agency work came into force on 5 December 2008. Member States had "
"three years to transpose its provisions into national law, ie by 5 "
"December 2011.</p> <p>The Directive has the following main "
"objectives:</p> <ul> <li>equal treatment for agency workers, as "
"regards employment status and security from the first day of "
"employment, unless there is social partner <a "
"href=\\derogation.htm\\>derogation</a> (Article 5);</li> <li>to allow "
"Member States, following consultation with the social partners, to "
"conclude <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/collectiveagreementsandtermsofemployment.htm\\>collective "
"agreements</a> which derogate, within limits, from the principle of "
"equal treatment, either by collective agreement or, in specific "
"circumstances, by agreement between the national social partners "
"(Article 5);</li> <li>respect for established social standards in user "
"firms through equal treatment as regards pay and conditions;</li> "
"<li>recognition of the temporary agency sector as a legitimate and "
"professional business, by removing unnecessary restrictions and "
"permits or bans (Article 4).</li> </ul> <p>This Directive applies to "
"workers (with a contract of employment or employment relationship with "
"a temporary work agency) who are assigned to user undertakings to work "
"temporarily under their supervision and direction. It applies to "
"public and private undertakings that are temporary work agencies or "
"user companies.</p> <p>All temporary workers should have the right to "
"basic protection from the first day of employment in the user "
"undertaking, together with the right to benefit from labour law, <a "
"href=\\equalpay.htm\\>equal pay</a> and <a "
"href=\\socialprotection.htm\\>social protection</a> available to "
"directly employed workers. Pay is specifically included (Article 3). "
"The Directive also provides the right to representation (Article "
"7).</p> <p>The principal benefits the Directive will provide are:</p> "
"<ul> <li>the right of agency workers to be informed about permanent "
"employment opportunities in the user undertaking (Article 6);</li> "
"<li>equal access to collective facilities in the user enterprise;</li> "
"<li>improved access to training and <a "
"href=\\childcare.htm\\>childcare</a> facilities in periods between "
"assignments, to enhance <a "
"href=\\employability.htm\\>employability</a>.</li> </ul> <p>The "
"Directive also requires that Member States review and justify, on the "
"grounds of general interest only, any existing restrictions or "
"prohibitions on the use of agency work. The Member States must also "
"report on what position it has adopted to the European Commission.</p> "
"<p>The Directive provides that Member States may authorise the social "
"partners, by means of collective agreements, or in specific "
"circumstances by agreement between the national social partners, to "
"establish working conditions which deviate from this principle, "
"provided that an adequate level of protection is ensured.</p> <p>On 5 "
"December 2011, the DirectiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs implementation date, "
"Eurociett issued a <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurociett.eu/fileadmin/templates/eurociett/docs/press_releases/111205_AW_Directive.pdf\\>statement</a> "
"concerning the transposition of the Directive, noting that a number of "
"Member States were not on course to meet the transposition deadline, "
"including Belgium, Greece and Italy. Eurociett also expressed concerns "
"that, in its view, there has been an imbalance in implementation, with "
"the equal treatment provisions of the Directive transposed into "
"national law, but the lifting of restrictions on agency working still "
"outstanding. However, Eurociett also noted that France, Romania and "
"Spain had removed sectoral bans on temporary work, France and Italy "
"had extended the range of contracts that can be offered by temporary "
"work agencies and Romania and Poland had increased the maximum length "
"of agency work assignments. UNI-Europa is also monitoring the "
"situation, and has expressed concerns about possible abuses, noting "
"that Article 5.1 of the Directive allows for a qualifying period "
"before the principle of equal treatment is applicable, on the basis of "
"a national social partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά agreement; it also "
"permits derogations and flexibilities for agency workers on permanent "
"contracts of employment who are paid between assignments. Uni-Europa "
"states that there is some evidence of temporary agencies employing "
"workers on permanent contracts, thus making them permanent employees "
"of the agency and exempt from the equal treatment requirements of the "
"Directive.</p> <p>See also: <a href=\\atypicalwork.htm\\>atypical "

"        activities of the trade union established by workers. The <a "
"href=\\communitycharterofthefundamentalsocialrightsofworkers.htm\\>Community "
"Charter of the\\n"
"        Fundamental Social Rights of Workers</a> 1989 provides for "

"\\n"
"        <p><i>Employers and workers of the European Community shall "

"\\n"
"        <p><i>Every employer and every worker shall have the freedom "

"\\n"
"        <p>The upgrading by Article 11 of this freedom into a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λright of associationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά could be "
"interpreted in light of this debate. Thus, the additional phrase\\n"
"        ΓΆβ‚¬Λin order to constitute professional "
"organisations or trade unions of their choiceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά may "
"enhance the substance of Article 11ΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λright of associationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά by\\n"
"        implying a right to engage in activities necessary to "
"constitute such organisations. Examples would be meetings of workers "
"(at the workplace, or during\\n"
"        working time) to discuss constituting trade unions; or strikes "

"\\n"
"        <p>All Member States protect fundamental trade union rights, "
"and in a number of Member States they have acquired constitutional "

"        all fundamental trade union rights have attained "
"constitutional protection. Even where specific trade union rights have "
"constitutional status\\n"
"        attributed to them, the specific content of the protected "
"right is not necessarily the same in all Member States.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>For example, freedom of association in trade unions is a "
"right which has acquired constitutional status in some Member States. "
"However, the precise\\n"
"        scope of a trade union ΓΆβ‚¬Λright to freedom of "

"\\n"
"        <p>Nonetheless, there are elements of trade union rights, "

"        unions. Rights also extend to autonomous organisation and to "
"trade union activity (including activity in works councils), and they "
"grant legal status\\n"
"        to collective agreements. Beyond this common core, there is a "
"substantial majority in favour of trade union rights relating to legal "
"definition,\\n"
"        <a href=\\informationandconsultation.htm\\>information and "
"consultation</a> (including works councils), and extension of "

"\\n"

"<br /> <p>Traineeships are defined by the European Commission as "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λa limited period of work practice spent at a business, "
"public body or non-profit institution by students or young people "
"having recently completed their education, in order to gain valuable "
"hands-on work experience ahead of taking up regular "
"employmentΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. This definition is given by the "
"Commission in its December 2012 Communication <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52012DC0728:EN:NOT\\>Towards "
"a quality framework on traineeships</a>, a second-stage consultation "
"of the EU-level social partners under Article 154 of the <a "
"href=\\treatyonthefunctioningoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Treaty on the "
"Functioning of the European Union</a>.</p> <p>The Commission goes on "
"to specify five main, partly overlapping, types of traineeships:</p> "
"<ul> <li>traineeships during education;</li> <li>traineeships forming "
"a mandatory part of professional training, such as law, medicine, "
"teaching, architecture, or accounting;</li> <li>traineeships as part "
"of active labour market policies;</li> <li>traineeships on the open "
"market;</li> <li>transnational traineeships.</li> </ul> <p>This "
"second-stage consultation followed a public consultation on a proposal "

"CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1039&amp;langId=en\\>Employment "
"Package</a> in April 2012. In their reply to this public consultation, "
"the European social partners asked to be formally consulted on the "
"planned initiative. The Commission launched the first stage of the "
"social partner consultation on 11 September 2012, followed by the "
"second stage in December 2012.</p> <p>The Commission in its "
"Communication highlighted the need for a quality framework on "
"traineeships. The EU stakeholders and institutions identified a range "
"of issues regarding the effectiveness, availability and quality of "
"traineeships. These concern factors such as insufficient learning "
"content, no or low compensation, and unsatisfactory terms and "
"conditions on arrangements other than remuneration or compensation, "
"such as substandard working conditions. The document also pointed to "
"the low level of intra-EU mobility for trainees.</p> <p>In its "
"December 2012 Communication, the Commission identified the elements "
"that would be necessary in the formulation of a quality framework for "
"traineeships. These are:</p> <ul> <li>a written agreement between the "
"trainee and the host organisation, covering all aspects of the "
"traineeship;</li> <li>easily accessible information on the rights and "
"obligations of the trainee, the employer and, where relevant, the "
"educational institution;</li> <li>well-defined objectives of the "
"traineeship and high-quality learning content;</li> <li>guidance from "
"a personal supervisor or mentor, who should evaluate performance at "
"the end of the traineeship;</li> <li>open-market traineeships of a "
"specified duration, in order to ensure that traineeships are not "
"replacing regular employment;</li> <li>a restriction on successive "
"traineeships with the same employer;</li> <li>social protection "
"coverage which is clarified between the trainee and the host "
"organisation;</li> <li>a written trainee agreement which should "
"specify clearly what, if any, compensation or remuneration is "
"offered;</li> <li>an acknowledgement that an unpaid traineeship may be "
"appropriate in the cases of some traineeships, where there is a mutual "
"benefit of knowledge transfer and learning for both the host "
"organisation and the trainee;</li> <li>an obligation on employers and "
"host organisations to increase cooperation with public employment "
"services and other stakeholders to increase the number of high quality "
"traineeships.</li> </ul> <p>The Commission also points to the option "
"of issuing a quality label to organisations and businesses that comply "
"with the quality framework or with a more limited set of quality "
"principles. A quality label for specific sectors could also be "
"considered.</p> <p>The Commission has made a commitment to issuing a "
"proposal for a quality framework on traineeships, but has stated that "
"it may suspend further work in this area if the social partners decide "
"to negotiate on the issue of traineeships. At present, the social "
"partners have not yet formally indicated whether or not they wish to "
"negotiate on this issue.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"covering over 10 million employees.</p> <p>The Commission gives the "
"following examples of TCAs:</p> <ul> <li>a world leader in transport "
"infrastructure, power generation and transmission came to an agreement "
"with the European Metalworkers Federation (<a "

"TCAs, including concrete examples and reviews of the main issues, as "
"well as putting forward options for addressing these issues.</p> <p>In "
"issuing its 2012 staff working document, the Commission called on "
"stakeholders and interested parties to submit their views on the "
"future development of TCAs. It stated that it would like to contribute "
"to the future development of TCAs by:</p> <ul> <li>supporting the "

"transnational level. A high\\n"
"        profile case of transnational industrial action, a "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛEuro-strikeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, was provoked by the "
"closure on 27 February 1997 of the Renault plant at Vilvoorde in\\n"
"        Belgium, without the management providing prior information to "
"or consulting with the Renault European Works Council. This led to "
"sympathy actions by\\n"
"        Renault workers from production sites across Europe. "
"Representatives from French, Belgian and Spanish unions met to "
"organise a one-hour strike on 7\\n"
"        March, which involved thousands of workers in "
"RenaultΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs plants in the three countries. Workers in "
"Volkswagen, Volvo, Opel and Ford plants in Belgium\\n"
"        staged sympathy actions, while workers in Portugal expressed "
"sympathy, but did not join the one-hour stoppage. More than 10,000 "
"workers from Belgium,\\n"
"        France, Spain, Portugal and Slovenia attended a demonstration "
"outside Renault headquarters near Paris on 11 March 1997.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>In the context of various restructuring processes, "
"significant transnational industrial action was also undertaken at the "
"European plants of General\\n"
"        Motors Europe (GME). In 2001, a European day of action was "
"organised by the European MetalworkersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά Federation "
"(EMF) at all European plants of General\\n"
"        Motors (GM) in order to protest against the decision to close "
"its Vauxhall car manufacturing facilities at Luton in the United "
"Kingdom. Over 40,000 GME\\n"
"        employees from different European plants in Belgium, Germany, "
"Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom took part in the "
"protest.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>In 2004, thousands of GME workers participated in a "
"European day of action in protest against the "
"companyΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs restructuring programme that initially\\n"
"        provided for relocation processes, with the closing down of at "
"least one manufacturing plant, the reduction in employment levels and "
"a cut in wage\\n"
"        levels. The day of action was organised by the EMF and the "
"European Employee Forum (EEF), i.e. the GME European Works Council. "
"The countries involved\\n"
"        included Belgium, Germany, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the "
"United Kingdom. In 2006, the managementΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs decision to "
"close the Azambuja plant in Portugal\\n"
"        again led to actions across European GM production "

"\\n"
"        <p>Another case of transnational industrial action concerned "
"the Electrolux Group. In 2005, the Electrolux central management "
"announced a restructuring\\n"
"        plan that targeted the closure of production sites in various "
"EU Member States. In this case, also, the EMF decided to coordinate "
"the actions of the\\n"
"        various national trade union organisations. In October 2005, a "
"Europe-wide action day was organised in order to protest against the "
"restructuring plans\\n"
"        of the Electrolux Group. On this occasion, about 20,000 "
"Electrolux employees in France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Sweden "

"        <p><i>Workers and employers, or their respective "

"laws and practices, the right to\\n"
"        negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the "
"appropriate levels and, in cases of conflicts of interests, to take "
"collective action to defend\\n"
"        their interests, including strike action.</i></p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Earlier drafts of Article 28 explicitly provided for rights "
"of collective bargaining and collective action "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λincluding at the European Union "
"levelΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά\\n"
"        and ΓΆβ‚¬Λat all levelsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. These "
"phrases were later deleted. The final text appears to have made an "
"important distinction regarding the levels at which the\\n"
"        rights can be exercised. The right to <a "
"href=\\collectivebargaining.htm\\>collective bargaining</a> is granted "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λat the appropriate levelsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά; but "
"this\\n"
"        phrase does not qualify the right to take collective action. "
"Article 28, therefore, stipulates no limitation on the levels at which "
"the right to\\n"
"        collective action may be exercised.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>The effect of the textΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs failure to grant "
"explicitly the right to collective action ΓΆβ‚¬Λat the "
"appropriate levelsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά is open to at least two\\n"
"        interpretations. First, the qualifying limitation, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λin accordance with Community law and national laws and "
"practicesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά could be read as implying that\\n"
"        such laws and practices may restrict the permissible level of "
"collective actions. However, this first interpretation is weakened by "
"the provision in\\n"
"        Article 52 that limitations on the exercise of the rights in "
"the Charter, which are provided by law, are subject to a number of "
"restrictions; not\\n"
"        least, they must ΓΆβ‚¬Λrespect the essence of rights "
"and freedomsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά (Article 52).</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>Alternatively, in light of the apparent limitation to "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe appropriate levelsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά only of the "
"right to collective bargaining and not of the right to\\n"
"        take collective action, the implication is rather that "
"collective action is permissible at ΓΆβ‚¬Λall "
"levelsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. In an EU Charter, this would include also "
"the\\n"
"        EU level.</p>\\n"
"\\n"
"        <p>As there is no clearly defined right to strike at EU level, "
"obstacles to organise transnational industrial action can derive from "

"        national systems of industrial relations and the role of the "

"<br /> <p>In June 2004, the intergovernmental conference of Member "
"States (which met in Brussels on 17ΓΆβ‚¬β€18 June 2004) "
"agreed a <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2004:310:SOM:en:HTML\\>Treaty "
"establishing a Constitution for Europe</a>. The purpose of the "
"Constitution should be to:</p> <ul> <li>simplify the overlapping "
"series of treaties which provide the current legal foundation for the "
"EU;</li> <li>reaffirm the values on which the EU is built;</li> "
"<li>establish the fundamental rights and duties of its citizens;</li> "
"<li>clarify the relationship between Member States and the Union;</li> "
"<li>improve decision-making processes in the EU.</li> </ul> <p>None of "
"the articles in the text of the proposed Constitution is entirely new. "
"Each article is based either on a provision from existing treaties, or "
"on a provision from the existing <a "
"href=\\charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter of "
"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>. Most articles are "
"identical in wording or spirit to their predecessors, others are "
"differently presented, and some are significantly modified. The "
"proposed Constitution is divided into four parts:</p> <ul> <li>Part I: "
"This includes the definition and the objectives of the Union, "
"fundamental rights and citizenship, Union competences and its "
"institutions and bodies, as well as provisions on finances and "
"membership.</li> <li>Part II: The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the "
"European Union.</li> <li>Part III: The policies and functioning of the "
"Union.</li> <li>Part IV: General and final provisions.</li> </ul> "
"<p>The need to consolidate the UnionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs Treaties was "
"already highlighted in the <a href=\\treatyofnice.htm\\>Treaty of "
"Nice</a>. Later at its summit in Laeken in December 2001, the European "
"Council posited a series of questions related to structural matters: "
"How should the division of competence between the Union and the Member "
"States be organised? How can the European "
"institutionsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά respective tasks be better defined? How "
"can the coherence and efficiency of the EUΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs external "
"relations be ensured? How can the UnionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs democratic "
"legitimacy be strengthened? In this context, the question emerged as "
"to whether a revision of the European Treaties might lead to the "
"adoption of a Constitution for the Union. As a result, the European "
"Council decided to convene a ΓΆβ‚¬ΛConvention on the Future "
"of EuropeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, which had the task to consider these "
"issues and identify possible responses.</p> <p>In addition to the "
"Chair, Valery Giscard dΓΆβ‚¬β„ΆEstaing, and two Vice-chairs, "
"the Convention was composed of 15 representatives of the national "
"governments, 30 members of national parliaments, 16 members of the "
"European Parliament and two Commission representatives. The then "
"acceding 10 Member States, the European Economic and Social Committee, "
"the Committee of the Regions, the social partners ΓΆβ‚¬β€ "
"<a href=\\etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>, <a href=\\ceep.htm\\>CEEP</a> and <a "
"href=\\unice.htm\\>UNICE</a> (now <a "
"href=\\businesseurope.htm\\>BUSINESSEUROPE</a>) ΓΆβ‚¬β€ and "
"the European Ombudsman were also involved in the "
"ConventionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs proceedings.</p> <p>In June 2003, the "
"Convention on the Future of Europe proposed a Treaty establishing a "
"Constitution for Europe to replace the existing EU and EC treaties. "
"The draft was presented by Giscard dΓΆβ‚¬β„ΆEstaing to the "
"heads of governments at the Thessaloniki Summit on 20 June 2003, with "
"a minority report from a ΓΆβ‚¬ΛeuroscepticΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"group attached. In October 2003, the intergovernmental conference "
"(i.e. the representatives of the 25 national governments) commenced "
"negotiations on the submitted draft Constitution. On 18 June 2004, all "
"the 25 Member States agreed on an amended draft which was signed by "
"the Heads of State or Government of the 25 Member States and three "
"candidate countries on 24 October 2004 in Rome. The Treaty "
"establishing a Constitution for Europe must be ratified by the "
"national parliaments and in many countries by a referendum too. Once "
"the Treaty has been ratified and the ratification has been officially "
"notified by all the signatory states (lodging of the ratification "
"instruments), the Treaty can enter into force and become "
"effective.</p> <p>The people of France and the Netherlands rejected "
"the text of the proposed Constitution on 29 May and 1 June 2005 "
"respectively. In the light of these results, the European Council, "
"meeting on 16 and 17 June 2005, considered that ΓΆβ‚¬Λwe do "
"not feel that the date initially planned for a report on ratification "
"of the Treaty, 1 November 2006, is still tenable, since those "
"countries which have not yet ratified the Treaty will be unable to "
"furnish a clear reply before mid-2007ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>A "
"period of reflection, explanation and discussion is currently under "
"way in all countries, whether or not they have ratified the "
"Constitution. On 13 October 2005, the European Commission launched its "
"<a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/decisionmaking_process/a30000_en.htm\\>Plan "
"D</a> ΓΆβ‚¬β€ Democracy, Dialogue and Debate "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ to put in place a framework, through national "
"governments, for a 25-country debate on EuropeΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"future. This debate should involve citizens, civil society, social "
"partners, national Parliaments and political parties.</p> <p>At the "
"same time, the ratification process continued in several Member "
"States. Since June 2005, another five countries approved the "
"Constitution. By July 2006, a total of 15 Member States had ratified "
"the <a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/index_en.htm\\>Constitution "
"for Europe</a>: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Germany, Greece, "
"Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovakia, "
"Slovenia and Spain.</p> <p>At its June 2006 meeting, the European "
"Council carried out an overall assessment of national debates in the "
"Member States. After the period of reflection work, the focus should "
"be on delivery of concrete results and implementation of projects. The "
"European Council agreed on a two-track approach. On the one hand, best "
"use should be made of the possibilities offered by the existing "
"treaties in order to deliver the concrete results that citizens "
"expect. On the other hand, the Presidency was to present a report to "
"the European Council during the first semester of 2007, based on "
"extensive consultations with the Member States. This report contained "
"an assessment of the state of discussion with regard to the "
"Constitutional Treaty and explore possible future developments. In the "
"second half of 2006, the Finnish Presidency was due to bring the "
"passive period of reflection to a close and start active discussions "
"on the future of the Treaty with the Member States and EU "
"institutions, in accordance with the conclusions from the June 2006 "
"European Council. With the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon on 17 "
"December 2007 and is entry into force on 1 December 2009 the "
"Constitutional Treaty was, in parts, integrated into EU law. Other "
"parts will remain a footnote in the process of European "
"integration.</p> <p>See also: <a href=\\eulaw.htm\\>EU law</a>; <a "

"<br /> <p>The <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html\\>Treaty "
"of Amsterdam</a> was approved by the European Council held in "
"Amsterdam on 16-17 June 1997 and signed on 2 October 1997 by the "
"Foreign Ministers of the 15 EU Member States. On 1 May 1999, it came "
"into force, having been ratified by all the Member States, following "
"their own constitutional rules.</p> <p>The Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 "
"made important changes in the form of substantive amendments to the "
"treaties, particularly to the three-pillar structure of the Treaty on "
"European Union (<a href=\\treatyofmaastricht.htm\\>Treaty of "
"Maastricht</a>). The focus in what follows is on those changes "
"concerned with employment and industrial relations.</p> <p>The Treaty "
"of Amsterdam added new objectives in Article 2 EU, including the "
"promotion of a high level of employment. The <i>acquis</i> of the 1985 "
"Schengen Treaty on the gradual abolition of common border checks was "
"integrated by a Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty into the EU "
"framework, and the 13 Member States party to the arrangement were "
"authorised to engage in future ΓΆβ‚¬Λcloser cooperation "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in this field.</p> <p>Significant changes to the "
"Community Treaty include the addition of new tasks in Article 2 EC: "
"promotion of <a href=\\equalitybetweenwomenandmen.htm\\>equality "
"between women and men</a> is explicitly mentioned as a task. In "
"addition, there was introduced a new non-discrimination provision in "
"Article 13 EC, which expressly confers legislative competence on the "
"Community to combat <a href=\\discrimination.htm\\>discrimination</a> "
"based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, "
"age, or sexual orientation.</p> <p>The importance of unemployment as "
"an issue facing the EU was recognised in a new Title on Employment "
"added to the EC Treaty (Articles 125-130 EC). It provided for the "
"establishment of a new Employment Committee with a primarily advisory "
"role.</p> <p>The election of a Labour Government in the UK in May 1997 "
"allowed for the repeal of the Protocol on Social Policy and the "
"incorporation of the <a href=\\agreementonsocialpolicy.htm\\>Agreement "
"on Social Policy</a> into the EC Treaty. The Social Chapter of the EC "
"Treaty was amended to include an express legal basis for legislation "
"on equality between women and men in employment, and new provisions on "
"positive action for women (Article 141 EC). The Treaty of Amsterdam "
"came into effect on 1 May 1999.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"(<a href=\\http://www.eurotreaties.com/maastrichtec.pdf\\>Treaty of "
"Maastricht 296Kb PDF</a>) and the Treaty establishing the European "
"Community, signed in Lisbon on 13 December 2007 (<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:SOM:EN:HTML\\>2007/C "
"306/01</a>), introduces important changes to the institutional "
"framework of the European Union. Its main goal is to improve "
"decision-making processes in the European Union in order to take into "
"account the accession of new Member States.</p> <p>To achieve this "
"aim, the Treaty extends qualified majority voting to more policy "
"areas, particularly in the field of justice and home affairs. It also "
"defines a new double majority rule. In addition, it introduces a "
"permanent Council President for a two-and-a-half year period, as well "
"as a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. "
"Furthermore, it enhances the role of the <a "
"href=\\europeanparliament.htm\\>European Parliament</a> and the "
"national parliaments in the legislative process of the European Union. "
"The Treaty also reduces the number of commissioners and MEPs. Finally, "
"it creates a single legal entity for the European Union.</p> <p>The "
"Treaty of Lisbon includes enhancements to the social dimension of the "
"European Union. It adds the <a href=\\n"
"ondiscriminationprinciple.htm\\>non-discrimination principle</a> and "
"<a href=\\equalitybetweenwomenandmen.htm\\>equality between women and "
"men</a> to the values of the European Union. It sets the following "
"objectives: full employment and social progress in a social market "
"economy; the combating of <a href=\\socialexclusion.htm\\>social "
"exclusion</a> and <a href=\\discrimination.htm\\>discrimination</a>; "
"solidarity between generations; the promotion of economic, social and "
"territorial cohesion; and solidarity between the Member States.</p> "
"<p>A number of so-called ΓΆβ‚¬ΛhorizontalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"social clauses stipulate that all European Union policies must take "
"into account social and environmental requirements and so guarantee "
"that the various policies and actions of the Union are coherent. For "
"example, Article 5a of the Treaty contains an obligation to meet the "
"requirements of promoting a high level of employment, of guaranteeing "
"adequate <a href=\\socialprotection.htm\\>social protection</a>, of "
"combating social exclusion and of ensuring a high level of education, "
"training and protection of human health. Other horizontal clauses "
"state that the social dimension must be taken into account in all "
"actions of the Union. This would include the combating of inequality, "
"promotion of <a href=\\genderequality.htm\\>gender equality</a> and "
"the fight against discrimination.</p> <p>The Treaty also officially "
"recognises the role of the social partners, particularly the <a "
"href=\\tripartitesocialsummit.htm\\>Tripartite Social Summit</a> for "
"Growth and Employment.</p> <p>The Treaty inserts a reference to the "
"Charter of <a "
"href=\\http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf\\>Fundamental</a> "
"Rights of the European Union (<a "
"href=\\http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf\\>80Kb "
"PDF</a>) into Article 6 of the <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11992M/htm/11992M.html\\>Treaty "
"on European Union</a> (TEU), making this charter legally binding. A "
"protocol added to the Treaty, however, concedes that the Charter does "
"not create rights enforceable in Poland or the United Kingdom (UK). In "
"the case of the UK, the British government had particular reservations "
"with regard to the social and labour rights of Title IV (Solidarity) "
"of the Charter. While Poland declared its support for this part of the "
"Charter, it had serious reservations concerning the "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λsphere of public moralityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and family "
"law.</p> <p>The Treaty of Lisbon aims to solve the institutional "
"impasse following the failed referenda on the <a "
"href=\\http://european-convention.eu.int/docs/treaty/cv00850.en03.pdf\\>Treaty "
"establishing a Constitution for Europe (751Kb PDF)</a> in France and "
"the Netherlands in 2005. The main differences concern the form of the "
"Treaty. Unlike the Constitutional Treaty, which intended to replace "
"the previous EU treaties with one consolidated text, the Treaty of "
"Lisbon consists of a series of amendments to the TEU and the Treaty "
"establishing the European Community, now renamed the Treaty on the "
"Functioning of the European Union (<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF\\>TFEU, "
"450Kb PDF</a>; see <a href=\\treatiesofrome.htm\\>Treaties of "
"Rome</a>).</p> <p>The Treaty of Lisbon was scheduled to be ratified by "
"all Member States by the end of 2008 to allow it to come into force by "
"the target date of 1 January 2009. However, Ireland, the only country "
"that is bound by its constitution to hold a referendum, voted against "
"the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in its referendum of 12 June "
"2008. At the European summit on 12 December 2008, Ireland committed "
"itself to holding a second referendum on the Lisbon Treaty by November "
"2009. In exchange for this commitment, Ireland was able to receive "
"concessions from the other EU Member States. These include a guarantee "
"that each Member State will retain a commissioner in future European "
"Commissions, as well as a promise that the EU would not impose rules "
"on Ireland concerning taxation, on ethical issues such as abortion, "
"euthanasia and gay marriage, or interfere with its traditional "
"neutrality. The second Irish referendum was held on 2 October 2009 and "
"resulted in a vote of 67.1% in favour of the Treaty and 32.9% "
"against.</p> <p>All other Member States ratified the Treaty through "
"their national parliaments. The last country to ratify the Treaty was "
"the Czech Republic, on 3 November 2009. The Treaty came into force on "
"1 December 2009.</p> <p>European social partners have welcomed the "
"ratification of the Lisbon Treaty despite their disappointment with "
"the TreatyΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs lack of ambition. The European Trade "
"Union Confederation (<a href=\\etuc.htm\\>ETUC</a>) issued a <a "
"href=\\http://www.etuc.org/IMG/pdf_01-02-12-09Resolution-The_ETUC_and_the_Lisbon_Treaty.pdf\\>resolution "
"(62Kb PDF)</a> on the treaty on 1ΓΆβ‚¬β€2 December 2009, "
"stating that ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe new Treaty is a better one than the "
"current provisions of the Nice Treaty but it does little to advance "
"social progressΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The ETUC would have liked, for "
"example, to see qualified majority voting become the usual procedure "
"for social policy initiatives. However, the ETUC acknowledges that, "
"compared to the <a href=\\treatyofnice.htm\\>Treaty of Nice</a>, the "
"Lisbon Treaty is a step forward in the right direction, particularly "
"because it makes the <a "
"href=\\charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter of "
"Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> legally binding, although "
"it is opposed to the ΓΆβ‚¬Λopt-outsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά granted "
"for the UK and Poland. The employer organisation <a "

"the European Union (EU): EC, Common Foreign and Security Policy, and "
"Cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The two "

"<br /> <p>The Treaty of Nice of 2000 made a number of important "
"changes to the Treaties, especially with a view to enlargement of the "
"Community by the accession of new Member States. Most attention was "
"directed to questions concerning the composition of the Commission "
"(increase in numbers to take account of the then acceding countries) "
"and the weighting of votes (mainly in favour of larger Member States) "
"and voting procedures in the Council of Ministers (significant "
"extension of <a href=\\qualifiedmajorityvoting.htm\\>qualified "
"majority voting</a> to many policy areas currently requiring "
"unanimity).</p> <p>There was one change to the qualified majority "
"voting procedure which had an impact on the field of employment and "
"industrial relations. As regards the <a "
"href=\\codecisionprocedure.htm\\>co-decision procedure</a> and "
"qualified majority voting, the position remained as previously "
"determined. However, a provision was inserted (Article 137(2), "
"paragraph 3 EC) allowing for a unanimous decision of the Council, on a "
"proposal from the Commission, to authorise qualified majority voting "
"in three cases where unanimity was the rule: in Article 137(1) EC: (d) "

"<br /> <p>The predecessor of the <a "
"href=\\treatiesofrome.htm\\>Treaties of Rome</a> was the <a "
"href=\\http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/treaties/treaties_ecsc_en.htm\\>Treaty "
"of Paris</a>, which set up the European Coal and Steel Community "
"(ECSC) in 1951, with six Member States (Belgium, France, Germany, "
"Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) as the founder members. Like "
"the later European Economic Community, the ECSC was designed to create "
"a common market in coal and steel, essentially an economic, not a "
"social policy objective. However, Article 2 of the Treaty of Paris had "
"as its objective to contribute to the development of employment and "
"improvement of the standard of living of the Member States. Article 3 "
"stated that the purposes of the institutions of the new Community were "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λto promote improved working conditions and an improved "
"standard of living for the workers in each of the industries for which "
"it is responsibleΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Comparison may be made with "
"Article 117 of the former EC Treaty: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛMember States "
"agree upon the need to promote improved working conditions and "
"improved standards of living for workers....ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> "
"<p>The ΓΆβ‚¬Λemployment policyΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of the ECSC "
"was based not on stability of employment, but on the contrary: the "
"adaptation of workers to economic change. The creation of a common "
"market in coal and steel meant closure of some plants and "
"re-conversion of others. The ECSC provided help to support the "
"re-conversion of enterprises and the redeployment of workers who lost "
"their jobs. The policy was not to protect jobs in the sense of a "
"stable employment but to support technological change with all the "
"implications for restructuring labour in the enterprise, including "
"loss of employment, but without the workers suffering financial "
"detriment. The emphasis was on helping such workers to find other work "
"or a different occupation.</p> <p>Two provisions in the employment and "
"industrial relations sphere are worth noting. First, Article 68 "
"authorised the High Authority to intervene if wage levels and social "
"provisions led to a distortion of competition within the market (it "
"has never been used). Second, there was labour representation on the "
"High Authority, the ECSC executive composed of nine members, which "
"included a trade union representative. In addition, the High Authority "
"was flanked by a Consultative Committee composed of employer and "
"worker representatives, chosen from lists put forward by "
"representative organisations. The High Authority was later dissolved "
"into the European Commission and the Consultative Committee into the "
"European Economic and Social Committee. The remarkable quality of this "
"European labour law and policy, combining active labour market policy "
"with labour involvement in the mechanisms of adjustment, is "
"highlighted by the contrast with what succeeded it in the <a "
"href=\\treatiesofrome.htm\\>Treaties of Rome</a>.</p> <p>The Treaty of "
"Paris was concluded with a provision for a fixed period of duration of "
"50 years. It expired, together with the ECSC in 2002, and its subject "
"matter now falls within the remit of the TEU/TFEU .</p> <p>See also: "

"<br /> <p>On 2 March 2012, the heads of state or government of the EU "
"Member States signed a Treaty on Stability, Coordination and "
"Governance (<a "
"href=\\http://european-council.europa.eu/eurozone-governance/treaty-on-stability\\>TSCG</a>) "
"in the Economic and Monetary Union. The so-called Fiscal Treaty was "
"signed by all the Member States with the exception of the United "
"Kingdom and the Czech Republic.</p> <p>The Treaty aims to safeguard "
"the stability of the euro area as a whole. It requires the national "
"budgets of Member States to be in balance or in surplus. This goal "
"will be deemed to have been met if their annual structural government "
"deficit does not exceed 0.5% of nominal GDP. If this is not the case, "
"a correction mechanism will be triggered automatically. In addition, "
"the deficit must be in line with the country-specific minimum "
"benchmark figure for long-term sustainability. Progress towards this "
"will be assessed each year as part of the <a "
"href=\\europeansemester.htm\\>European semester</a> process.</p> "
"<p>The Treaty also provides for economic policy coordination and "
"convergence. This obliges Member States to report on their public debt "
"issuance plans and to make sure that major economic policy reforms are "
"discussed beforehand and, where appropriate, coordinated among "
"themselves.</p> <p>The Treaty came into force on 1 January 2013 "
"following ratification by 12 eurozone Member States. The Treaty will "
"now be incorporated into existing EU Treaties, a process that is "
"expected to be completed within the next five years.</p> <p>It is "
"difficult to predict the impact of the Treaty on industrial relations, "
"but it would seem likely that budget cuts in Member States will "
"continue as national governments try to ensure that they comply with "
"the provisions of the Treaty. This is likely to involve continuing "
"cost-cutting measures, particularly in the public sector, which will "
"have an impact on employment levels, investment in training and "
"welfare provision.</p> <p>Pay freezes, pay pauses, and reform of wage "
"indexation measures are also likely to continue, particularly in "
"countries such as Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal which have "
"experienced the most significant economic shocks in recent years. "
"Other impacts could include further decentralisation of collective "
"bargaining, as businesses seek more flexibility at company level.</p> "

"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛhorizontalΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά social clause (Article 9 "
"TFEU) stipulates that all European Union policies must take into "

"<p>The TFEU renumbers the articles of the TEC. The Employment Title of "

"Articles 125 to 130 of the TEC). The Social Policy Title of the TFEU "
"is Title X, comprising Articles 151 to 161 (formerly Articles 136 to "

"<br /> <p>The provisions of the Treaties are the primary source of <a "
"href=\\eulaw.htm\\>EU law</a>. The doctrine of <a "
"href=\\supremacyofeulaw.htm\\>supremacy of EU law</a> means that "
"Treaty provisions take precedence over domestic laws (<i>Flaminio "
"Costa v. ENEL</i>, <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61964J0006:en:HTML\\>Case "
"6/64</a>). Equally, treaty provisions containing rules on employment "
"and industrial relations take precedence over domestic labour law "
"rules. The European Court of Justice may attribute to some Treaty "
"provisions the legal quality of ΓΆβ‚¬Λdirect "
"effectΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά: individuals may directly cite them before "
"national courts (<i>NV Algemene Transporten Expeditie Onderneming van "

"26/62</a>). Treaty provisions can be used, therefore, to make claims "
"before domestic courts and override domestic law. For example, in "
"<i>Defrenne v. Sabena</i>, <a "

"of Justice</a> held: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛThe principle that women and men "

"Article 157 TFEU], may be relied on before the national "
"courtsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Claims based on treaty provisions with "

"<br /> <p>The European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized "
"Enterprises (known by its acronym UEAPME after the French name "
"<i>ΓΆβ‚¬β€ Union europΓƒΒ©enne de "
"lΓΆβ‚¬β„Άartisanat et des petites et moyennes "

"of crafts, trade and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). UEAPME "
"is a recognised European Social Partner and acts on behalf of crafts "
"and SMEs in the European Social Dialogue and in discussions with the "
"EU institutions. As the European SME umbrella organisation, UEAPME "
"incorporates 80 member organisations consisting of <a "

"members</a> and <a "

"members</a>. Full members are the national cross-sectoral SME "
"federations from EU countries which have voting rights in the "
"associationΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs bodies. Associate members, with no "
"voting rights, are the European branch federations, national "
"cross-sectoral SME federations from non-EU countries and other "
"associate members, which support the SME family. UEAPME represents "

"be the body representing the interests of employers. As a result, on 5 "
"September 1996, UEAPME invoked Article 230 EC (now Article 263 TFEU) "
"before the European Court of First Instance (CFI) to challenge the "
"validity of the directive implementing the agreement (<a "

"<br /> <p>Undeclared work is defined by the <a "

"Communication <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52007DC0628:EN:HTML\\>Stepping "
"up the fight against undeclared work</a> (COM/2007/0628) as "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λany paid activities that are lawful as regards their "
"nature but not declared to public authorities, taking into account "
"differences in the regulatory system of Member "
"StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. This definition links undeclared work with "
"tax and/or <a href=\\socialsecurity.htm\\>social security</a> fraud "
"and covers a range of activities from informal household services to "
"clandestine work by illegal residents, but excludes criminal "
"activities. In its 2007 communication, the Commission states that "
"undeclared work is a ΓΆβ‚¬Λcomplex phenomenon influenced by a "
"wide range of economic, social, institutional and cultural "
"factorsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and that it can ΓΆβ‚¬Λobstruct "
"growth-oriented economic, budgetary and social "
"policiesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Undeclared work affects all Member "
"States and is therefore a matter of common concern. The transformation "
"of undeclared work into formal work is an important issue for the "
"employment policy of the European Commission. Undeclared work risks "
"undermining the financing of social services, already under pressure, "
"decreases individualsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά <a "
"href=\\socialprotection.htm\\>social protection</a> status and labour "
"market prospects, and may affect competitive conditions. It also runs "
"counter to European ideals of solidarity and social justice.</p> <p>A "
"2007 Eurobarometer survey, <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_284_en.pdf\\>Undeclared "
"work in the European Union</a>, represents the first attempt to "
"measure undeclared work on an EU-wide basis. The survey found that the "
"level of participation in undeclared work is relatively low overall, "
"with just 11% of the EU27 population admitting to having bought goods "
"or services that involved undeclared work and 5% of citizens reporting "
"having engaged in undeclared work themselves in the previous 12 "
"months. However, there was significant variation among Member States. "
"A 2008 <a href=\\http://eurofound.europa.eu/\\>Eurofound</a> report, "
"<a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/htmlfiles/ef0813.htm\\>Tackling "
"undeclared work in the EU</a>, found that EU countries currently "
"pursue a ΓΆβ‚¬Λdeterrence approachΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, which "
"seeks to increase the actual or perceived likelihood of detection and "
"penalties. It found that Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά main policy "
"measures to combat undeclared work are focused on punishing "
"non-compliance, although prevention measures are also becoming more "
"commonplace.</p> <p>The European Union has undertaken a number of "
"actions to reduce the incidence of undeclared work. In the 2007 "
"communication mentioned above, the Commission identified the main "
"drivers for the informal economy, set out ways to reduce it and "
"proposed a series of concrete follow-up actions at European and "
"national levels.</p> <p>In the April 2012 <a "
"href=\\employmentpackage.htm\\>Employment Package</a>, the Commission "
"stated that transforming informal or undeclared work into regular "
"employment could help to reduce unemployment in the European Union. "
"The Employment Package highlights the need for improved cooperation on "
"undeclared work between Member States and calls for the creation of an "
"EU-level platform for labour inspectorates and other enforcement "
"bodies to combat undeclared work.</p> <p>In the "

"consultation</a> of the EU social partners, under Article 154 of the "
"<a href=\\treatyonthefunctioningoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Treaty on the "
"Functioning of the European Union</a> on enhancing EU cooperation in "
"the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work. It pinpointed the "
"three main issues surrounding undeclared work:</p> <ul> <li>abusive "
"behaviour regarding working conditions and/or health and safety norms, "
"leading to the involvement of labour inspectorates;</li> <li>fraud on "
"social insurance contributions, involving social security "
"inspectorates;</li> <li>tax evasion, mobilising tax authorities.</li> "
"</ul> <p>The Commission believes that enhancing cooperation at EU "
"level between these enforcement authorities would greatly improve the "
"situation and suggests that one way of achieving this would be to set "
"up a European platform comprised of representatives of the Member "
"States and other stakeholders. The consultation seeks to elicit the "
"social partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά views on whether membership of the "
"platform should be mandatory or voluntary, whether it should deal with "
"cross-border issues alone or with national issues too, whether its "
"work should be limited to labour inspections, and what form it should "
"take. The social partners may decide in future to launch their own "
"negotiations in the area of undeclared work.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"49</a> EC (now Article 56 TFEU), on the freedom to provide "

"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/righttostrike.htm\\>right "

"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/charteroffundamentalrightsoftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Charter "
"of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> (entitled "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛRight of collective bargaining and "
"actionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά):</p> <p><i>Workers and employers, or their "
"respective organisations, have, in accordance with Community law and "
"national laws and practices, the right to negotiate and conclude "
"collective agreements at the appropriate levels and, in cases of "
"conflicts of interests, to take collective action to defend their "
"interests, including strike action.</i></p> <p>The effect of Article "
"28 is to give to all workers, regardless of the nature of the "
"employer, whether public or private, the right to take collective "
"action, exercised within the terms of any national laws.</p> <p>Thus "
"under EU laws the right to freedom to provide services and the right "
"to strike may both be regarded as fundamental rights, which Member "
"States must guarantee a right to exercise. However, given that the "
"exercise of one of these rights may impede or limit the exercise of "
"the other, the challenge is to devise a robust interpretation of the "
"concept of fundamental freedoms that allows space for both to be "
"applied. It is for this reason that the issue of the scope of the "
"right to unrestricted free movement of services has been challenged, "
"in the joined cases of <a "
"href=\\http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=rechercher&amp;numaff=C-438/05\\>Viking</a> "
"(Case C-438/05) and <a "
"href=\\http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=rechercher&amp;numaff=C-341/05\\>Laval</a> "
"(Case C-341/05). In these cases, the employer submitted that the right "
"to take industrial action is subservient to the rights under Articles "
"43 and 49 EC (now Articles 49 and 56 TFEU) and that any industrial "
"action that impedes these fundamental rights be prohibited. In "
"response, the trade unions submitted that the right to take collective "
"industrial action may fall outside the scope of Article 43 EC (now "
"Article 49 TFEU), even where the impact of such industrial action is "
"to hinder, impede or prevent the exercise of an Article 43 EC (now "
"Article 49 TFEU) right. Should that position not be upheld by the "
"court, the unions also claimed that even if Article 43 EC (now Article "
"49 TFEU) does confer rights, exercisable by a private undertaking, to "
"provide services, nevertheless industrial action which restricts such "
"freedom can be objectively justified and is thus not completely "
"prohibited by Articles 43 and 49 EC (now Articles 49 and 56 TFEU). The "
"two cases were considered by the Advocates General in May 2007 who "
"were of the opinion that industrial action is subject to Treaty rights "
"to exercise freedom of services. However, in <i>Laval</i>, the "
"Advocate General also held that unions can use collective action to "
"compel service providers from another Member State to provide "
"equivalent terms and conditions, provided the collective action is "
"motivated by public interest objectives, such as the protection of "
"workers and the fight against social dumping. In <i>Viking,</i> the "
"Advocate General held that industrial action which restricts such a "
"freedom might be objectively justified.</p> <p>The two opinions "
"therefore imply that the right to freedom of movement cannot be seen "
"as an all-embracing restriction on the right to take collective action "
"but at the same time collective action cannot be placed outside of the "
"provisions on freedom of movement, so as to exclude it from having to "
"take account of rights derived under the Treaty. However, industrial "
"action, which is legitimate and proportionate, can co-exist with the "
"right to freedom of movement, even if in practice it places some "
"restrictions on that freedom.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<br /> <p>In the EU context, the term ΓΆβ‚¬Λvoluntary "
"agreementΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά usually refers to an agreement which is "
"not the result of a political decision-making process exclusively "
"within the framework of the official EU institutions (<a "
"href=\\europeancommission.htm\\>European Commission</a>, <a "
"href=\\counciloftheeuropeanunion.htm\\>Council of the European "

"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ that is, the so-called Community method) but mainly "
"the outcome of negotiations between social partner organisations which "
"are legitimised to produce such agreements by EU legislation. The "
"chief charachetistic of voluntary agreements is that they are not "
"enshrined in EU law.</p> <p>Since the 1990s, the EU has been "
"developing a new regulatory policy, which increasingly puts emphasis "
"on the use of alternative instruments that are complementary to "
"traditional legislation. These alternative instruments which are of a "
"less compelling or non-governmental nature are often labelled with the "
"general terms of ΓΆβ‚¬Λ<a href=\\softlaw.htm\\>soft "
"law</a>ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λself-regulationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and/or "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λco-regulationΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛVoluntary agreementsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά are a typical "
"result of these alternative forms of governance. The aim of "
"diversifying the regulatory instruments has been mainly to enhance the "
"effectiveness, legitimacy and transparency of EU action and to follow "
"the principles of conferred powers, <a "

"EU legislative process.</p> <p>The <a "

"ΓΆβ‚¬Λkey to better governanceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά and asks for "

"a proposal for a second work programme for 2006ΓΆβ‚¬β€2008. "
"The aim of this second EU social dialogue work programme was to "
"promote growth, jobs and the modernisation of the <a "

"2006ΓΆβ‚¬β€2008 work programme also included the conclusion "

"full potential. The CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs focus in this area "
"is on ensuring that women have the opportunity to work when they want "
"and that they can balance work with other family responsibilities.</p> "
"<p>The Commission Communication of 7 June 2000, <a "

"a community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005)</a>, "
"noted that women are not as well integrated into the labour market as "
"men. They generally have less regular and secure jobs, as well as the "
"dual burden of domestic work, including caring responsibilities. "
"Furthermore, in the majority of Member States, "
"womenΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs employment rate remains lower than for men. "
"Women with small children have the lowest employment rates, and the "
"gender gap remains large ΓΆβ‚¬β€ on average around 17% "
"across the EU.</p> <p>Labour market segregation remains high, even "
"where women have high employment rates (including Denmark, Finland and "
"Sweden). Women are concentrated in low-graded, service, public sector "
"and part-time jobs, and tend to dominate in caring professions while "
"men fill most posts in construction and agriculture. With respect to "
"<a href=\\equalpay.htm\\>equal pay</a>, moreover, on average women are "
"paid less than men for the same work or for work of equal value.</p> "
"<p>In order to support the Commission and the Member States in "
"implementing the Community objectives for promoting equality between "
"women and men and ensuring that they are incorporated into Community "
"policies across the board, a European Institute for Gender Equality "

"promoting female entrepreneurship and self-employment; assessing "

"proposing targeted initiatives to improve equality in decision-making; "
"monitoring progress made towards achieving the 25% target for women in "
"top-level decision-making positions in research; and promoting an "

"Union and the Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬Β¦ shall have as their "
"objectives the promotion of employment, improved living and working "
"conditions, so as to make possible their harmonisation while the "
"improvement is being maintainedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Further, Article "
"153 TFEU states that ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe Union shall support and "
"complement the activities of the Member StatesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in a "
"range of social policy fields, including working conditions (Article "
"153 1(b)).</p> <p>The thinking of the EU on its competences in the "
"area of working conditions has developed considerably over the past "
"half century. The original EEC Treaty of 1957 took the view that the "
"objectives of improved living and working conditions were to be "
"achieved primarily through the mechanisms of the common market. "
"Intervention was only to secure what was consistent with the common "
"market: the free movement of labour. This policy was revised in 1972, "
"when European heads of state agreed that the increasing involvement of "
"labour and management in the economic and social decisions of the "
"Community was desirable. Accordingly, the European Commission was "
"instructed to draw up a <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/socialactionprogramme.htm\\>Social "
"Action Programme</a> (SAP), the three main objectives of which were: "
"attainment of full and better employment in the Community; improvement "
"of living and working conditions; and increased involvement of "
"management and labour in the economic and social decisions of the "
"Community and of workers in the life of undertakings. Progress towards "
"these objectives took the form of a legislative programme during the "
"1970s. The Council also established the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/europeanfoundationfortheimprovementoflivingandworkingconditions.htm\\>European "
"Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions</a> in "
"1975 to undertake research into the new and developing area of "
"Community social policy, and to stimulate and provide the scientific "

"<h3>Changes in working conditions</h3> <p>Changes in working "
"conditions and other aspects of the employment relationship can "
"generate serious industrial relations problems. One issue is that "
"workers may not have precise information about their working "
"conditions in the first place. This was addressed by <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0533:EN:HTML\\>Council "
"Directive 91/533/EEC</a> of 14 October 1991 on an "
"employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs obligation to inform employees of the "
"conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship. The "
"directive stipulates that the employer must provide information "
"covering all ΓΆβ‚¬Λessential aspectsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά of the "
"employment relationship. The employer is obliged to prepare a document "
"with the requisite information, and give it to the employee not later "
"than two months after the commencement of employment. Further, a new "
"document that reflects any changes in core working conditions must be "
"issued.</p> <p>The normal rule is that an employer cannot change the "
"terms and conditions of employment without the consent of the "
"employee, when such modifications are outside the <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/managementprerogative.htm\\>management "
"prerogative</a>. So, merely informing the employee by a written "
"statement is not conclusive of the existence of an agreed change in "
"the terms. When the employer does not have the right in the contract "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ if they try to alter rates of pay, hours of work, "
"or the status or grade of the employee ΓΆβ‚¬β€ they must "
"obtain the employeeΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs consent before the change can "
"have any legal effect. The existence of a written statement does not "
"mean that it has been agreed and is thus binding.</p> <p>If the "
"employer unilaterally drafts the written information, challenges "
"concerning the accuracy, and hence validity, of the document "
"purporting to comply with the directiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs "
"requirements may arise in the absence of any worker input to the "
"document. This could be avoided if the document itself cites a "
"collective agreement as the source for changes in terms and "
"conditions.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"in the sense of the lowest common denominator. According to the Court, "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe significance of the expression "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λminimum requirementsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά in Article 118 "
"is simply ... that the provision authorises Member States to adopt "
"more stringent measures than those which form the subject-matter of "
"Community actionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Instead, the standards adopted can "
"look to Member States where <a href=\\healthandsafety.htm\\>health and "
"safety</a> of workers is given a much higher priority, not a minimal "
"level of concern. The principle thus established has important "
"implications for raising EU labour standards in the working "
"environment.</p> <p>The significance of this judgement at the time was "
"due to the fact that the scope for social policy proposals eligible "
"for <a href=\\qualifiedmajorityvoting.htm\\>qualified majority "
"voting</a> (QMV) was very limited. It gave the Commission the legal "
"authority to propose measures concerning any and all working "
"conditions, which affect health and safety in the working environment, "
"in the broad sense defined by the Court, and ask for approval by the "
"Council of Ministers in QMV.</p> <p>The term ΓΆβ‚¬Λworking "
"environmentΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά became of central importance due to the "
"insertion of a new Article 118A into the Treaty of Rome by the <a "
"href=\\singleeuropeanact.htm\\>Single European Act</a> (now part of "
"Article 153(1) TFEU). The new article allowed for the adoption of "
"directives with a view ΓΆβ‚¬Λto encouraging improvements, "
"especially in the working environment, as regards the health and "
"safety of workersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. Crucially, legislative proposals "
"based on the new Article 118A could be adopted by QMV in the Council "
"of Ministers. This was of great importance, as it enabled the "
"Commission to use the new Article to advance the social policy of the "
"Community via the new possibility of QMV and avoid a single Member "
"State veto. One immediate result was the adoption of the 1989 "
"framework directive on health and safety at work (<a "

"<br /> <p>The Working Time Directive (<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"2003/88/EC</a> of 4 November 2003) defines working time as "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λany period during which the worker is working, at the "
"employer\\'s disposal and carrying out his activities or duties, in "
"accordance with national laws and/or practiceΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"(Article 2(1)). <a href=\\restperiods.htm\\>Rest periods</a> are "
"defined as ΓΆβ‚¬Λany period which is not working "
"timeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The Directive does not allow for any interim "
"category.</p> <p>Working time is one of the most important areas of "
"employment where the EU has intervened through legislation to improve "
"employment conditions and the <a href=\\healthandsafety.htm\\>health "
"and safety</a> of workers. The Directive lays down provisions for a "
"maximum 48-hour working week (including <a "
"href=\\overtime.htm\\>overtime</a>), rest periods and breaks, and a "
"minimum of four weeksΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά paid leave per year, to "
"protect workers from adverse health and safety risks. It applies to "
"all sectors of activity, both public and private. A number of areas, "
"such as air, rail, road, sea, inland waterway and lake transport, sea "
"fishing, other work at sea and doctors in training, which were exempt "
"from the original 1993 Directive, were brought within its scope in an "
"amendment agreed in 2000. The main provisions of the working time "
"Directive are:</p> <ul> <li>a maximum average working week of 48 "
"hours, including <a href=\\overtime.htm\\>overtime</a> (calculated "
"over a four-month <a href=\\referenceperiod.htm\\>reference "
"period</a>);</li> <li>a limit of eight working hours, on average, per "
"24 hours for night workers ΓΆβ‚¬β€ defined as a person who "
"normally works at least three hours during night time;</li> <li>a rest "
"break after six consecutive hoursΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά work;</li> "
"<li>rest periods of at least 11 hours consecutive hours per 24-hour "
"period and 35 consecutive hours per seven-day period;</li> <li>a "
"minimum of four weeksΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά paid <a "
"href=\\annualleave.htm\\>annual leave</a> which needs to be taken "
"during the leave year stipulated, and cannot be paid in lieu except "
"where the workerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs employment is terminated, or in "
"the case of a short-term <a href=\\casualworker.htm\\>casual "
"worker,</a> where it may be translated into pay.</li> </ul> <p>The "
"Directive, therefore, guarantees that all workers do not have to work "
"excessive hours or excessively at night and are entitled to adequate "
"rest and holidays. These principles apply to all <a "
"href=\\worker.htm\\>workers</a> (not just <a "
"href=\\employee.htm\\>employees</a>) and require employers to keep "
"records to show that the provisions of the Directive are being "
"complied with. As the Directive applies to all "
"ΓΆβ‚¬ΛworkersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, this covers everyone except "
"for those who are genuinely <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/self-employedperson.htm\\>self-employed</a>. "
"The most important exception applies to workers on "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λunmeasured timeΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, such as those in "
"managerial and professional roles, which allows them to determine what "
"hours they work and when. These workers are subject to the 48-hour "
"working week limit but only in respect of time that they are "
"contractually required to work. Any additional hours they may choose "
"to work remain unmeasured time and fall outside the regulations.</p> "
"<p>The Directive also contains an <a href=\\optout.htm\\>opt-out</a> "
"clause, which permits Member States not to apply the maximum 48-hour "
"weekly working limit, if the individual worker voluntarily agrees to "
"this.</p> <h3>Derogations from the working time provisions of the "
"Directive</h3> <p>The working time Directive also defines a range of "
"types of worker and circumstances whereby the employer can vary or "
"waive some of its key provisions.</p> <p>There are a number of "
"categories of workers who are excluded from the directive:</p> <ul> "
"<li>managing executives or other persons with autonomous "
"decision-making powers (see above);</li> <li>family workers;</li> "
"<li>workers officiating at religious ceremonies in churches and "
"religious communities.</li> </ul> <p>In the case of other activities, "
"Member States may derogate ΓΆβ‚¬Λby means of laws, "
"regulations or administrative provisionsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, but, "
"equally, <a href=\\derogation.htm\\>derogation</a> may occur, without "
"the need for Member State authorisation, ΓΆβ‚¬Λby means of "
"collective agreementsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. However, these cases are "
"subject to provision of ΓΆβ‚¬Λequivalent periods of "
"compensatory rest or... appropriate protectionΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά "
"(Article 17(2)).</p> <p>The provisions relating to reference periods, "
"night working and weekly and daily rest periods (with compensatory "
"rest to be provided in lieu) contain flexibility in order to "
"accommodate the anomalous working patterns of a number of categories "
"of workers, including:</p> <ul> <li>workers whose place of work and "
"place of residence are distant from one another, including offshore "
"work, or where their different places of work are distant from one "
"another;</li> <li>workers engaged in security and surveillance "
"activities;</li> <li>workers involved in activities which require "
"continuity of service or production (e.g. hospitals, residential "
"institutions, gas, water and electricity production, industries in "
"which work cannot be interrupted on technical grounds, and research "
"and development activities);</li> <li>workers engaged in areas where "
"there is ΓΆβ‚¬Λa foreseeable surge of "
"activityΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά;</li> <li>in cases of accident or the "
"imminent risk of an accident.</li> </ul> <p>Finally, in the case of "
"the requirement for 11 hours minimum daily rest (Article 3) and 24 "
"hours minimum weekly rest (Article 5) ΓΆβ‚¬β€ but not in "
"the case of the requirement of daily rest breaks (Article 4) "
"ΓΆβ‚¬β€ certain derogations are possible (Article "
"17(4)):</p> <ul> <li>(a) in the case of shift work activities, each "
"time the employee changes shift and cannot take daily and/or weekly "
"rest periods between the end of one shift and the start of the next "
"one;</li> <li>(b) in the case of activities involving periods of work "
"split up over the day, particularly those of cleaning staff.</li> "
"</ul> <h3>Proposals to amend the directive</h3> <p>The original 1993 "
"Directive included an obligation on the <a "
"href=\\europeancommission.htm\\>European Commission</a> to review its "
"provisions in relation to the opt-out and the reference period for "
"calculating average working time. Following the failure of the social "
"partners to agree to initiate the <a "
"href=\\socialdialogue.htm\\>social dialogue</a> process on the "
"Directive, the European Commission issued a proposal in 2004 for "
"amendment of the Directive in relation to three issues: the opt-out; "
"the reference period; and the treatment of on-call working time.</p> "
"<p>The CommissionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs proposals in relation to these "
"three issues were opposed by the European Parliament, although by June "
"2008 it appeared that a compromise could be reached among the Member "
"States. However, while a common position was reached with regard to "
"the reference period ΓΆβ‚¬β€ the four-month period for "
"calculating average working time ΓΆβ‚¬β€ no agreement was "
"reached on the other issues of the opt-out and on the definition of "
"on-call time. In relation to the opt-out, the differences related to "
"the period of any future opt-out and whether it should be limited. The "
"Council proposal retained this option without any end date, the "
"position of the Parliament was for a phasing out.</p> <p>A major area "
"of difficulty in relation to the definition of working time lies in "
"the definition of ΓΆβ‚¬Λon-callΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά time, where "
"the worker has a contractual obligation to be available for work, but "
"may not actually work. In relation to on-call time, the Commission had "
"proposed a new differentiation between active and inactive parts of "
"on-call time, whereas the Parliament favoured any period of on-call "
"time, including inactive time, spent on the "
"employerΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs premises being counted as working time. "
"The failure to reach agreement resulted in the matter being "
"transmitted to a Conciliation Committee in 2009. In April 2009, the "
"Committee reported its failure to find a compromise, the first time "
"that no agreement had been able to be reached at the conciliation "
"stage.</p> <p>In March 2010, the Commission began again by issuing a "
"first-stage consultation document to the EU-level social partners, "
"asking them for their views on a review of the Directive. In the light "
"of fundamental changes to working patterns since the Directive was "
"originally conceived, the Commission proposes to undertake a "
"comprehensive review of the Directive rather than just focusing on the "
"issues that were deemed to be problematic between the Council and the "
"Parliament. Issues that it wished to address include: working hours "
"and the opt-out; <a href=\\oncallworking.htm\\>on-call working</a>; <a "
"href=\\flexibility.htm\\>flexibility</a> in averaging out weekly "
"working time; and flexibility in minimum daily and weekly <a "
"href=\\restperiods.htm\\>rest periods</a>.</p> <p>Following "
"submissions from the social partners, the Commission issued a "
"second-stage consultation document in December 2010. Concluding that "
"changes to working time rules were ΓΆβ‚¬Λurgently "
"neededΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, the second-stage consultation document asks "
"for the social partnersΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά views on two options for "
"revision of the Directive:</p> <ul> <li>a focused review, dealing only "
"with the issues of on-call time and compensatory rest; and</li> <li>a "
"comprehensive review, dealing with a wider range of matters "
"highlighted by the social partners in their responses to the first "
"consultation.</li> </ul> <p>In November 2011, the EU-level social "
"partners indicated that they would enter into talks to revise the "
"Directive. Under the process provided for by Article 155 of the Treaty "
"on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), they have nine months "
"in which to negotiate an agreement.</p> <p>See also: <a href=\\n"

"Directive 93/104/EEC</a> of 23 November 1993 concerning certain "
"aspects of the organisation of working time (as amended by <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0034:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"2000/34/EC</a> of 22 June 2000; integrated text in <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"2003/88/EC</a> of 4 November 2003), aimed to outline basic procedural "
"conditions for the regulation of working time by <a "
"href=\\collectiveagreementsandworkingconditions.htm\\>collective "
"agreements</a>. Introducing its first proposal for a directive on "
"working time, the Commission explained that (Explanatory Memorandum, "
"page 3): ΓΆβ‚¬Λissues mentioned in the action programme in "
"the field of the adaptation of working time should be left to both "
"sides of industry and/or national legislation. In addition these "
"matters should be dealt with in depth within the framework of the "
"dialogue between both sides of industry at Community "
"levelΓΆβ‚¬Β¦.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>In particular, the "
"Commission emphasised that, ΓΆβ‚¬Λthe question of systematic "
"<a href=\\overtime.htm\\>overtime</a> is a subject best dealt with by "
"the two sides of industry and by national "
"provisionsΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. The role of working time in achieving "
"flexibility of capacity utilisation was seen to be due to the social "
"partners: ΓΆβ‚¬ΛIn many cases legislation, but above all the "
"conclusion of a large number of collective agreements, supported the "
"trend towards more flexible use of productive "
"equipment....ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά</p> <p>The final text of the directive "
"also included a large number of new provisions, which made collective "
"bargaining an element in the setting of EC standards on working time. "
"The role of collective bargaining in determining some of the EU "
"standards on working time allowed for <a "
"href=\\derogation.htm\\>derogation</a> to prescribed standards. For "
"example, derogation by collective agreements or agreements between the "
"two sides of industry is permitted from Article 3, 4, 5, 8 and 16 for "
"certain other activities, subject to equivalent compensatory periods "
"(Articles 17(2) of <a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"2003/88/EC</a>), and from Articles 3 and 5 in the case of shift work "
"activities or others involving split periods of work. The most complex "
"provision allowing for derogation is Article 18 (<a "
"href=\\http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0088:EN:HTML\\>Directive "
"2003/88/EC</a>) which provides for derogation by (1) national or "
"regional agreements, or (2) lower level agreements in conformity with "
"rules laid down by national or regional agreements. This gives primacy "
"to national or regional levels of collective agreements. Other levels "
"may only derogate in conformity with these.</p> <p>The autonomy of "
"this bargaining is limited by the provision that Member States "
"ΓΆβ‚¬Λmay lay down rules for the application of this "
"paragraph by the two sides of industryΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά. It is not "
"clear how interventionist such rules may be. Rules simply prohibiting "
"derogations by the two sides of industry are unlikely to be permitted. "
"The question is how far rules regulating the actors entitled to "
"bargain (representativeness), the process of bargaining (rules on "
"strikes), or the outcomes (the legal effect of agreements) can impinge "
"on the autonomy of the two sides of industry without violating the "
"directiveΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs clear intention that the two sides of "
"industry be able to agree on derogations by means of collective "
"agreements.</p> <p>Member States are not obliged to lay down such "
"rules. In addition, where a statutory system does not assure national "
"or regional agreements on working time, or there is another legal "
"framework specifically for working time, Member States may allow "
"derogations by agreements ΓΆβ‚¬Λat the appropriate collective "
"level.ΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά In any event, all derogations must allow for "
"equivalent compensating <a href=\\restperiods.htm\\>rest "
"periods</a>.</p> <p>In a significant qualitative leap, the directive "
"also allowed for collective agreements to go beyond derogation and fix "
"or define relevant standards, the most striking example being that of "
"rest breaks during working hours (Article 4). Again, the provisions of "
"Article 4 may be derogated from by collective agreements under the "
"general derogation provisions of Articles 17(2) and 18. The effect of "
"such derogation is rendered more problematic by the fact that the "
"standard being derogated from by collective agreements may also have "
"been established by collective agreements. This raises complex "
"questions of the relations between different levels of collective "
"agreements. The law governing these questions is not homogeneous "
"across the Community. National labour laws, which purport to structure "
"collective agreements in an articulated hierarchy, may come into "
"conflict with the EC provisions authorising derogation.</p> <p>See "

"<br /> <p>According to the European Commission, workplace innovation "
"is a generic term used to describe ΓΆβ‚¬Λinnovations in the "
"way enterprises are structured, the way they manage their human "
"resources, the way internal decision-making and innovation processes "
"are devised, the way relationships with clients or suppliers are "
"organised or the way the work environment and the internal support "
"systems are designedΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>Workplace innovation "
"aims to increase employee motivation and enhance working conditions. "
"This in turn can impact positively on a range of factors such as "
"productivity, organisational performance and competitiveness. "
"Workplace innovation is often combined with other types of innovation, "
"such as technological innovation.</p> <p>Eurofound published a report "
"in 2012 on <a "
"href=\\http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2012/72/en/1/EF1272EN.pdf\\>Work "
"Organisation and Innovation (611Kb PDF)</a>, based on case study "
"research in 13 EU Member States. According to the findings, pressure "
"to improve performance was the main driver for workplace innovation. "
"The research showed this was particularly true in the context of the "
"current economic crisis, as well as the need to meet the challenges "
"posed by demographic change and increased competition.</p> <p>Some "
"companies adopted a dual approach to workplace innovation, consisting "
"of a top-down decision to innovate, followed by a bottom-up "
"implementation approach.</p> <p>The case study evidence in the "
"research suggests that the presence of social dialogue and the "
"involvement of worker representatives make a valuable contribution to "
"the implementation of human resource innovations. It was found that "
"workplace innovation, under the broader label ΓΆβ‚¬Λhigh "
"performance work practicesΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά, led to increased "
"knowledge sharing and problem sharing and solving. Innovatory "
"practices involving lean management, teamworking, flexible working "
"practices, workplace redesign and employee involvement were most "
"commonly associated with positive features such as increased company "
"productivity, greater organisational commitment, improved service "
"quality and, to a lesser extent, reduced customer complaints. Lean "
"management, teamworking and flexible working also contributed to "
"reduced operational costs.</p> <p>From a longer-term perspective, "
"workplace innovation can contribute to managing an ageing workforce by "
"helping to retain the skills of older workers while maintaining and "
"increasing their productivity levels. Some of the Eurofound case "
"studies highlighted improvements in job security for older workers, "
"who benefited from initiatives targeted at keeping them in the labour "

"Directive 94/33/EC of 22 June 1994 on the protection of young people "
"at work</a>, young workers are defined as individuals who are under 18 "
"years of age, who have an employment contract or an employment "
"relationship defined by the law in force in a Member State and/or "
"governed by the law in force in a Member State. This Directive also "
"defines adolescents as any young person of at least 15 years of age "
"but less than 18 years of age who is no longer subject to compulsory "
"full-time schooling under national law. The Directive provides for a "
"range of protections that apply to young workers, relating to areas "
"such as specific risks to their safety, health and development which "
"are a consequence of their lack of experience, of absence of awareness "
"of existing or potential risks or of the fact that young people have "
"not yet fully matured. Accordingly, under Article7(2), the following "
"work is prohibited in the case of young people:</p> <ul> <li>work "
"which is objectively beyond their physical or psychological "
"capacity;</li> <li>work involving harmful exposure to agents which are "
"toxic, carcinogenic, cause heritable genetic damage, or harm to the "
"unborn child or which in any other way chronically affect human "

"<li>work involving the risk of accidents which it may be assumed "

"insufficient attention to safety or lack of experience or training; "
"or</li> <li>work in which there is a risk to health from extreme cold "
"or heat, or from noise or vibration.</li> </ul> <p>The Directive also "
"provides that the working time of adolescents is restricted to eight "
"hours a day and 40 hours a week and young people. It also prohibits "
"night work for adolescents either between 22.00 and 06.00 or between "
"23.00 and 07.00. In the case of young workers, the Directive states "
"that the time spent on training by a young person working under a "
"theoretical and/or practical combined work/training scheme or an "
"in-plant work-experience scheme shall be counted as working time. The "
"Directive also provides for specific provisions governing rest and "

"figures relating to young workers also relate to the 15-24-year age "

"surrounding the definition of what constitutes a young worker, due to "
"the fact that young people are delaying their transitions into the "
"labour market, often through the extension of the provision of higher "
"education. This trend is particularly notable in developed economies "

"<br /> <p>The European Commission launched a comprehensive package of "
"policy initiatives on education and employment for young people in "
"Europe called <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/youthonthemove/index_en.htm\\>Youth on the "
"Move</a> in 2010. The scheme is part of the European "
"UnionΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs <a href=\\europe2020.htm\\>Europe 2020</a> "
"strategy for ΓΆβ‚¬Λsmart, sustainable and inclusive "
"growthΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά.</p> <p>The overall goals of Youth on the "
"Move are to improve young peopleΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs education levels "
"and employability, to reduce youth unemployment and to increase the "
"youth employment rate ΓΆβ‚¬β€ in line with the wider EU "
"target of achieving a 75% employment rate for the working-age "
"population. The initiative aims to do this by:</p> <ul> <li>making "
"education and training more relevant to young "
"peopleΓΆβ‚¬β„Άs needs;</li> <li>encouraging more young "
"people to take advantage of EU grants to study or train in another "
"country;</li> <li>encouraging EU countries to adopt measures to "
"simplify the transition from education to work.</li> </ul> <p>A key "
"element of the Youth on the Move scheme is the <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1006&amp;langId=en\\>Youth "
"Opportunities Initiative</a>, a set of measures introduced in 2012 and "
"2013 with the aim of reducing youth unemployment in the EU. The "
"specific goal of the Youth Opportunities Initiative is to support "
"those who left school or training without having achieved "
"upper-secondary education by encouraging them to return to school or "
"enrol in vocational training to acquire the skills most in demand on "
"the job market. The initiative also aims to help graduates acquire "
"their first work experience.</p> <p>Another element of the Youth on "
"the Move initiative is <a "
"href=\\http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=993&amp;langId=en\\>Your "
"First EURES Job</a>, which has set a target for "
"2012ΓΆβ‚¬β€13 of helping around 5,000 people fill job "
"vacancies throughout the EU. The scheme is based on national "
"employment services offering their support to both young jobseekers "
"and businesses interested in recruiting from outside their home "
"country. Support includes providing information, job search and "
"recruitment help, as well as funding. The amount of funding is subject "
"to the conditions and procedures put in place by the national "
"employment services.</p> <p>See also: <a "

"<p>Carried out every four years, this unique, pan-European survey "
"examines both the objective circumstances of European citizens' lives "
"and how they feel about those circumstances and their lives in "
"general. It looks at a range of issues, such as employment, income, "
"education, housing, family, health and work-life balance. It also "
"looks at subjective topics, such as people's levels of happiness, how "
"satisfied they are with their lives, and how they perceive the quality "
"of their societies.</p>\r\n"
"<p>By running the survey regularly, it has also become possible to "
"track key trends in the quality of people's lives over time. Previous "
"surveys have shown, for instance, that people are having greater "
"difficulty making ends meet since the economic crisis began. In many "
"countries, they also feel that there is now more tension between "
"people from different ethnic groups. And across Europe, people now "
"trust their governments less than they did before. However, people "
"still continue to get the greatest satisfaction from their family life "
"and personal relationships.</p>\r\n"
"<p>Over the years, the EQLS has developed into a valuable set of "
"indicators which complements traditional indicators of economic growth "
"and living standard such as GDP or income. The EQLS indicators are as "
"clear and appealing as GDP, however they are more inclusive of "
"environmental and social aspects of progress and therefore are easily "
"integrated into the decision-making process and taken up by public "
"debate at EU and national levels in the European Union.</p>\r\n"
"<p>In each wave a sample of adult population has been selected "
"randomly for a face to face interview. In view of the prospective "
"European enlargements and interest from the EFTA countries the "
"geographical coverage of the survey has expanded over time:</p>\r\n"

"<p>The European Company Survey (ECS) has been carried out every four "

"\t<li>analyse relationships between company practices and their impact "

"<p>The ECS is a questionnaire-based representative sample survey "
"carried out by telephone in the language(s) of the country. A special "
"feature of the survey is that interviews take place with the manager "
"responsible for human resources in the establishment and when possible "
"with an employee representative. The first wave of the survey covered "
"issues around working time arrangements and work-life balance at "
"company level. The second wave looked at different forms of "
"flexibility, including working-time flexibility, contractual "
"flexibility, variable pay and financial participation, as well as "
"accompanying human resource measures, and the nature and quality of "
"workplace social dialogue. The third survey will look at workplace "
"organisation, workplace innovation, employee participation and social "
"dialogue in European workplaces.</p>\r\n"
