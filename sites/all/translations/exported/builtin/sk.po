"A field has a <em>label</em> (the name displayed in the user "

"cannot be changed after you have created the field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"editing (text box, select list, file upload, etc.). Each field type "
"also has one or more display options, which determine how the field is "
"displayed to site visitors. The widget and display options can be "
"changed after you have created the field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can store one value, a specific maximum number of values, or an "
"unlimited number of values in each field. For example, an employee "
"identification number field might store a single number, whereas a "
"phone number field might store multiple phone numbers. This setting "
"can be changed after you have created the field, but if you reduce the "
"maximum number of values, you may lose information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you have defined a field, you can reuse it. For example, if you "
"define a custom image field for one content type, and you need to have "
"an image field with the same parameters on another content type, you "
"can add the same field to the second content type, in the <em>Add "
"existing field</em> area of the user interface. You could also add "
"this field to a taxonomy vocabulary, comments, user accounts, etc."
msgstr ""

"the label of a text field is unique to each use, while the setting for "
"the number of values is shared."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two main reasons for reusing fields. First, reusing fields "
"can save you time over defining new fields. Second, reusing fields "
"also allows you to display, filter, group, and sort content together "
"by field across content types. For example, the contributed Views "
"module allows you to create lists and tables of content. So if you use "

"Content-related actions on your site (creating, editing, or deleting "

"until cron runs, at which time it is replaced by the new content. "
"Unlike content-related actions, actions related to the structure of "
"your site do not cause affected content to be marked for reindexing. "
"Examples of structure-related actions that affect content include "
"deleting or editing taxonomy terms, enabling or disabling modules that "

"<p class=\"expandable\">The map below presents a consistent time "

"\n"
"Firstly, they are taken from databases that record collective "

"level or outcomes of pace-setting agreements. Data related to the six "

"    <p>\n"
"    You can create as many Feeds importer configurations as you would "
"like to. Each can have a distinct purpose like letting your users "
"aggregate RSS feeds or importing a CSV file for content migration. "
"Here are a couple of things that are important to understand in order "
"to get started with Feeds:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Every importer configuration consists of basic settings, a "
"fetcher, a parser and a processor and their settings.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    The <strong>basic settings</strong> define the general behavior of "
"the importer. <strong>Fetchers</strong> are responsible for loading "
"data, <strong>parsers</strong> for organizing it and "
"<strong>processors</strong> for \"doing stuff\" with it, usually "
"storing it.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    In Basic settings, you can <strong>attach an importer "
"configuration to a content type</strong>. This is useful when many "
"imports of a kind should be created, for example in an RSS aggregation "
"scenario. If you don't attach a configuration to a content type, you "
"can use it on the !import page.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Imports can be <strong>scheduled periodically</strong> - see the "
"periodic import select box in the Basic settings.\n"
"    </li>\n"
"    <li>\n"
"    Processors can have <strong>mappings</strong> in addition to "
"settings. Mappings allow you to define what elements of a data feed "
"should be mapped to what content fields on a granular level. For "
"instance, you can specify that a feed item's author should be mapped "
"to a node's body.\n"
"    </li>\n"
