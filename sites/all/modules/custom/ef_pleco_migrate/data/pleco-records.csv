The global digital economy accounted for 22% of the world's economy in 2015 and is forecasted to increase to 25% by 2020. This brings with it unprecedented change for customers' expectations of service as well as a new kind of employee with different expectations of how work should be organised.

Considering the ‘sharing economy’ as an umbrella construct and an essentially contested concept, we position the sharing economy as resting on three foundational cores: (1) Access economy, (2) Platform economy, and (3) Community-based economy. We show how each core holds distinct promises and paradoxes. This organizing framework shows how combining the cores can help sharing-economy initiatives to navigate certain tensions, but can also lead to new ones. We highlight the paradoxical nature of the sharing economy and make a case for balanced initiatives that combine the promises of each core while mitigating contradictions.

tmp-6,"Al-Ani, A.; Stumpp, S.",Internet Policy Review,Publisher,Rebalancing interests and power structures on crowdworking platforms,"Crowdwork on virtual platforms is developing into a recognisable employment and business model on the internet. Despite their many differences, the platforms that have emerged over the last few years have one thing in common: a crowd of individual producers and capabilities is mobilised – in the form of labour, accommodation or durable goods – onto the market in cooperation and competition with firms from traditional industries. This study analyses the factors crowdworkers consider relevant in their work and the measures they view as helpful in improving their working relationship with platforms. It is apparent that, in the best tradition of the peer economy, this new type of worker still considers learning and fun important factors for his or her engagement. Despite these effectively intrinsic factors, workers are quite aware of their situation, which does not put them on equal terms with the platform's algorithms and customer focus. This awareness of power disparities does not lead them, however, to reconsider their effectiveness when it comes to renegotiating terms with the platform: when specifically asked about the role of unions, the majority of crowdworkers did not expect help in self-organisation from these institutions. Considering the difficulties in regulating the market for platforms, (self-) organisation of crowdworkers, however, is an important prerequisite in rebalancing the power structure dominated by platform owners and their customers. Self-organisation is something digital natives are quite familiar with and we have to assume that crowdworkers are perhaps overconfident in their abilities. And due to the novelty of this industry, this confidence has not been shaken yet by labour disputes or even by growing dissatisfaction with platforms.",,2016-01-01,Research publication,"Al-Ani, A. and Stumpp, S.

A large and growing body of scholarship has attempted to predict the socio– technical outcomes of this shift, especially addressing three questions: 1) What are the complexity limits of on–demand work?, 2) How far can work be decomposed into smaller microtasks?, and 3) What will work and the place of work look like for workers? In this paper, we look to the historical scholarship on piecework — a similar trend of work decomposition, distribution, and payment that was popular at the turn of the 20th century — to understand how these questions might play out with modern on–demand work. We identify the mechanisms that enabled and limited piecework historically, and identify whether on–demand work faces the same pitfalls or might differentiate itself. This approach introduces theoretical grounding that can help address some of the most persistent questions in crowd work, and suggests design interventions that learn from history rather than repeat it.",,2017-01-01,Research publication,"Alkhatib, A., Bernstein, M.

We investigate conditions under which managers crowdsource design and whether such decisions subsequently boost product sales. Our empirical analysis is guided by qualitative insights gathered from executive interviews. We use a novel dataset from a pioneering crowdsourcing firm and find that three concept design characteristics—perceived usability, reliability, and technical complexity—are associated with the decision to crowdsource design. We use an instrumental variable method accounting for the endogenous nature of crowdsourcing decisions to understand when such a decision affects downstream sales. We find that design crowdsourcing is positively related to unit sales and that this effect is moderated by the idea quality of the initial product concept. Using a change-score analysis of consumer ratings, we find that design crowdsourcing enhances perceived reliability and usability.

tmp-10,"Aloisi, A. ",Labour & Law Issues,Publisher,Il lavoro “a chiamata” e le piattaforme online della collaborative economy: nozioni e tipi legali in cerca di tutele,"The paper, after giving an overview of recent labour trends in the digital economy, describes alternative working arrangements such as 'crowdworking' and 'work on-demand via platform'. The regulatory framework and the legal consequences of such innovative and non-standard forms of work are analysed in detail with emphasis on the improper classification of workers in the gig-economy. In the second section, the essay focuses on the recent Communication of the European Commission on Collaborative Economy that is aimed at establishing under which conditions an online platform should be considered a provider of the 'underlying services'. This focus is followed by an analysis of antitrust as well as labour law implications of Spanish, Italian and British rulings. The contribution explores the proposals on how to craft an intermediate category between employees and independent contractors. Workers in the on-demand economy have brought lawsuits alleging that the online platforms are misclassifying them as independent contractors, but the question remains still unsolved. Proponents recently advocated that a third category would be a good fit for digital platform work. Conversely, as far as Italy is concerned, the quasi-subordinate category created an opportunity for uncertainty and arbitrage resulting in the erosion of protection. The article describes the notion of the so called 'collaborazioni organizzate dal committente' (contractors whose performance is organised by the principal) as a tool to expand crowdworkers’ rights.Finally, the most recent Italian labour market reform could eventually provide a solution for the current disputes on how work in the gig-economy could be regulated. In fact, the scheme of 'collaborazioni organizzate dal committente' could represent a useful template, since it broadens the scope of the protections granted to standard employees. Italian: L’articolo offre un quadro delle più recenti tendenze del mercato del lavoro legate all’economia digitale. Sono passati in rassegna il crowd-employment e il lavoro a chiamata via piattaforma online, articolazioni flessibili della prestazione presso operatori digitali che facilitano l’incontro di domanda e offerta di lavoro. Al fine di inquadrare i servizi resi dalle piattaforme in una cornice legislativa nazionale e sovranazionale, si descrivono le prime iniziative regolatorie in materia (specificatamente, la Comunicazione sulla Collaborative Economy della Commissione Europea e la proposta di legge italiana sulla Sharing Economy). Si renderà conto della giurisprudenza che si è sviluppata nei confronti del servizio di mobilità condivisa Uber, analizzando in particolare il caso spagnolo, quello italiano e, da ultimo, quello britannico. Ci si rivolgerà con occhio critico all’armamentario lavoristico per valutarne l’eventuale obsolescenza ovvero apprezzarne l’attualità. Si descriveranno per sommi capi gli sviluppi dell’antico dibattito sulla necessità di attrezzare nuove categorie (ad esempio, un tertium genus tra lavoro autonomo e lavoro subordinato) per rispondere alle esigenze di un mercato in trasformazione. La pluridecennale esperienza italiana della parasubordinazione, pur nella sua “peculiare anomalia”, rappresenterà il metro di paragone: se ne tratteggerà l’evoluzione, per concentrare l’attenzione sul portato del comma 1 dell’art. 2 del d.lgs. 81/2015 (i.e. le collaborazioni organizzate dal committente). Infine, si avanzerà una proposta di disciplina della cosiddetta “gig-economy”, tentando una riconciliazione tra le formule contrattuali atipiche e l’apparato normativo vigente, con particolare riferimento agli innesti legislativi introdotti dal pacchetto del “Jobs Act”. In particolare, s’individuerà una buona soluzione di politica del diritto nel processo di estensione automatica degli effetti dello statuto protettivo tipico della subordinazione ai lavoratori economicamente o organizzativamente dipendenti.",,2016-01-01,Research publication,"Aloisi, A.

This prompts the question: what should labour law be for 'after labour'? The question is especially timely in the context of what Daniel Rogers has called 'the intellectual economy of catastrophe'. This Chapter explores three possible responses: that labour law should be viewed as a sub-field of constitutional and human rights law; that it should integrate workers into the structures of capitalism to ensure that they contribute to and benefit from its successes; and that it should maintain its historic function of mobilizing workers to defend their rights and interests, but should also encourage cooperation between workers' organizations and other social movements.",,2011-01-01,Research publication,"Arthurs, H.

The basic idea is to let parties rate each other, for example after the completion of a transaction, and use the aggregated ratings about a given party to derive a trust or reputation score, which can assist other parties in deciding whether or not to transact with that party in the future. A natural side effect is that it also provides an incentive for good behaviour, and therefore tends to have a positive effect on market quality. Reputation systems can be called collaborative sanctioning systems to reflect their collaborative nature, and are related to collaborative filtering systems. Reputation systems are already being used in successful commercial online applications. There is also a rapidly growing literature around trust and reputation systems, but unfortunately this activity is not very coherent.
