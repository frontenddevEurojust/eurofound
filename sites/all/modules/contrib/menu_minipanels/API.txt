Menu MiniPanels API
-------------------------------------

Deprecation warning:

Version 2 of Menu MiniPanels removed all JavaScript dependencies including
the qTip tooltip library. All hover menu effects, positioning, layout, and
visual styles are now written purely in CSS, and as a result, the PHP and
JavaScript APIs from Version 1 of Menu MiniPanels are no longer needed and
have been deprecated.

Refer to the README.txt for information on updating from version 1 to version 2.
